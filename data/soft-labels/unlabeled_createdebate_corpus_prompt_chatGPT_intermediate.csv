0	The argument being presented is that guns should be banned in America. The user suggests that guns can trigger violent activity in society, citing the Virginia University incident as an example. The user also argues that the presence of guns can encourage violent thoughts and actions towards individuals we may have negative feelings towards, such as a neighbor or classmate. Therefore, the user believes that guns should be banned permanently.
1	Some people believe that throughout history, governments have disarmed their citizens as a way to gain complete control.
2	While I understand your point, do you believe that allowing the possession of semi-automatic or more powerful weapons is the solution? In the event that the government uses force to control citizens, they are likely to use military-grade weapons, which are far more powerful than pistols and hunting rifles. The only way for the people to counter this effectively would be to have access to weapons of similar or greater power, or to adopt a non-violent movement similar to the Indian Non-violence peace movement that overthrew the British Empire in India.
3	The argument suggests that gun control is not an effective solution as it only disarms law-abiding citizens, leaving criminals with guns. Criminals who are already breaking the law are unlikely to follow additional laws, and restrictions on guns may encourage crime as it gives criminals more freedom to operate without fear of being harmed by their victims. While the police force is essential, they cannot be present at all times, and law-abiding citizens carrying guns can provide additional protection to themselves and others. However, the user believes that a mental health test should be required to obtain a concealed-carry license to ensure that all legal gun owners are mentally capable of ensuring their safety and the safety of others.
4	You argue that while guns may increase the ease with which a crime can be committed, responsible gun owners are unlikely to use their firearms to harm others, even in moments of anger or frustration. You suggest that the feelings of rage and hate that we experience internally are often exaggerated, and that sane and responsible individuals are unlikely to act on these emotions, even if they have access to a firearm. In your view, it is only criminals and serial killers who purchase guns with the intention of using them to harm others, while law-abiding gun owners use their firearms for self-defense and other legitimate purposes.
5	Thank you for your input, pvtNobody. It seems that the argument being made is that guns are not inherently dangerous, but rather it is the actions of irresponsible individuals that lead to harm.
6	The argument suggests that while guns can be lethal, banning them may not be the best solution. The argument further states that banning guns would be impractical as they are widespread in America. Instead, the argument proposes that people should be educated on proper gun safety and that measures should be taken to ensure that only responsible individuals have access to guns.
7	You suggest that while the caliber of a weapon is an important factor in a fight, it is not the only one. Tactics and training also play a significant role. Additionally, you point out that the success of the Indian non-violence movement was due to the British Empire's decision not to use force. When a military actively suppresses resistance, non-violent resistance may no longer be effective.
