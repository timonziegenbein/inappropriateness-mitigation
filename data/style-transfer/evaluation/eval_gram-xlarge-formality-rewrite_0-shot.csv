But it is certainly ironic that 'sublime is not sublime'.","I have had this discussion with my brother numerous times. First, the word'sublime' has multiple definitions, and none of them describe the band to which it refers.

How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term memory.

Sexual harasment outside of the workplace?:,"Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours.

"Cmv: sex should be treated as just an activity that people do, like fishing or watching a movie.:","Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:

1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 

2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 
3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc.

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

Is it better to have a lousy father or to be fatherless:,It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.,"It is difficult to not have a male role model to look up to as you grow up. However, I believe being fatherless is better than having an inadequate father. The reason is that you do not want to look up to a male who isn't living life to his full potential. Therefore, you will start relying on yourself from the very beginning without the need for a male companion. Additionally, there will always be other individuals by your side helping you to reach your goals in life.

However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.
Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a ""probable cause"", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.","Ethically, it is not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.

"If prostitution is illegal, how can it be legal to pay two people to have sex and film it in a porn movie?:","The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats.

The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts are hard to see. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with.

Bleach vs fullmetal alchemist   stance: fullmetal alchemist:,"They aren't really on the same level.
Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.
FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.
Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.
The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.","Bleach is a good anime, but the quality is not comparable to FMA.

There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 an using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is automatically no.","College athletes do get paid, but the question is not whether or not they get paid enough.

Recently that a law has come out about the wireless router.?:,"The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service (in this case, someone's broadband connection) without permission, he has committed an offence.

I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law was around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted.

Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.","The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, states that if one uses another person's computer service without permission, they have committed an offence.

Mental anguish is a tort.  I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim.  The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of disciplining has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (i.e. alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.

You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action.  You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected.  Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change.

In this manner you protect your intersts - and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.","The dismissal does not mean that the case has been decided, but it does leave the possibility that the company may try to collect the debt or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies.

Should capital punishment be allowed?:,"To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared captial punishment to abortion:

The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.

To answer the previous post, the President can declare ANYONE, not just foreigners, a ""person who might be aiding terrorists"", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. Effectively, this has entirely negated habeas corpus.

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  

SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a ""Contigency"" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.  Contact your local bar association for a reference.","Is it ""unfair dismissal""?

"Cmv: if you marry a famous and wealthy male, you are irrational if you are surprised by infidelity.:","Its quite simple. 

Men who very wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.

Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you.

For this reason, i believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.","It is quite simple.

Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:,"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic.

Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)","In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus.

Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. Therefore, Dr. Jones does not feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.

I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!

I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.

I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It is absurd to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).

Cmv: i think that outsourcing to china isn't all that bad:,"The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed. ","The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap.

It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","The Beef Wellington was very delicious and the bread pudding dessert was a great touch. I would definitely recommend this place and Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington.

business name: tim hortons. city: montréal. categories: restaurants, food, fast food:","I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things.  We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.  I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.

Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds.  Because that we had to throw it out.  We were  already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.","I had heard good things about Tim Horton's, so we went for breakfast before our train back to the States.

For example, last night in the Super Bowl, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last two minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback. Therefore, we need each other and depend on each other to be great.

The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:,"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","I disagree.

Evolution vs. creation   stance: evolution:,"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.","Debates are based on convincing evidence.

To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.
So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.
The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) .

The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

Cmv: manual transmissions in cars are completely obsolete.:,"I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten

1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 

2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety.

3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term.

4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 

5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 

6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 

7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving.

I want to see the competition, competition is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.

Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcholol and other intoxicant. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.

So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.","The crime itself is what you are punished for, not the reaction times.

The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.

Cmv: destiny doesn't look like the revolutionary title it's made out to be:,"Bungies next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be such a revolutionary game. Frankly, it looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But otherwise it's a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary? 



I mean the setting looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the revelation of the ships not being flyable and there being no space combat -they're just cut scene machines- was a big disappointment for me.

Cmv: nationalism causes hate and bigotry:,"I am Canadian by birth but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I find everyone in Canada tries to hold onto their culture and wave a flag signifying their bloodline and heritage.

From what I have seen, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. 

Why can’t we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity? The fear of losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted. CMV

Cmv: affirmative action policies encourage the prejudice they seek to prevent.:,"Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background.

I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill ""race quotas"" to ""diversify the campus"" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.

At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good).  Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler.  Legislators try to take the middle path.

So, this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big but, the lawyers assume lots of risk in civil matters--which in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So, before lawyers touch many civil cases they will pose some really important questions, i.e, is this a winnable case and is this worth my time--considering how much I (lawyer) could potentially earn?

I feel I am at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!

"Cmv: in blind listening tests, most people would fail differentiate mp3 from the original cd source (even on good equipment).:","Lately I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag mp3's.

He's mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.

That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot.

Cmv: i believe current euro skepticism will lead to the dissolution of the eu and eventually more turmoil in the region.:,"Hi everyone,

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. 

Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

Gravity as einstein depicts does not exist.   stance: einstein is wrong.:,"Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?
Just because one man has a feeling all matter warps space-time doesn't make it true!
Think about it... get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks. Literally!
This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the ""ultimate sagging mattress"" that is often alluded to.
Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions.
2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes.
3. It can never work with quantum physics.
4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum?
5. Other theories are far more logical, but have been gunned down by conservative physicists.","Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?

The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by deffinition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have  little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. 

A guy weak enough to be ""raped"" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.","It is legal for a woman to have sex with a man. However, it is extremely difficult for a man to prove that he is not willing to have sex.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct.

Cmv: skateboarding is an art form and should be respected as much as any other street art.:,"People who know nothing of it seem to usually be slightly disdainful towards it, it's seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature and has generally bad connotations if you ask the average joe.

* fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style

* a sort of artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in, it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative

if you're more in favor of a corporations right to take up public space with art than you are in favor to peoples desire to rebel against that with street art then fair enough I dont expect to change your mind with this and you wont change mine by saying it's against the law but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.","Skateboarding is seen by many as being a form of hooliganism, associated with being immature, and generally has bad connotations.

For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's ""regular"" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together.

There is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas just so you can deliver them.  In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service.  The faster the delivery the better (as long as nobody gets injured).","There is no law that says managers must hold back pizzas so you can deliver them.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

I hope this helps.","I am not sure if this is relevant to your class, but this is my personal opinion. Historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included.

I dont like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, inncocent people would not goto prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor. ","If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, etc). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.

business name: paramount middle eastern kitchen. city: toronto. categories: middle eastern, restaurants, halal, breakfast & brunch:","I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. 

I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.

I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.","I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point. Perhaps I am just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations and it failed.
