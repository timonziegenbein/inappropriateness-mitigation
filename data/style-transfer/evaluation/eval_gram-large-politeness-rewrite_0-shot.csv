Can anyone help me with creating a bill to be passed for my government class?:,"OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license.  We need the law because a standard drivers license will make the country more secure against terrorists.  Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill.  The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address.  The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security.  The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues.  It will actually remove a burden from the states.","OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license?

The only one playing god is the man with the gun.   stance: agree:,"I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceeded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.

"Do dogs have the capacity to remember   stance: dogs have the capacity for remembering people, places and objects:","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity.

How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance.

business name: agincourt bakery. city: scarborough. categories: event planning & services, delis, caterers, italian, bakeries, food, restaurants:","Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try.  Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","Since this place is close to where I live and it showed good yelp ratings, I figured I would give it a try. Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods.

In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.","This debate has clarified for me that the government should not really be in the marriage business.

Can the police keep your car permantly if you have 3rd suspended license?:,"Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?

If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.

Cmv: artists who do not wish their works to be published should have their wishes respected posthumously.:,"Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson ""release"" an album of songs that he never wanted to be released.  Likewise, Tolkien's translation of Beowulf has just been published despite his protestations that it is ""hardly to my liking"".  Jackie Kennedy's private letters to a priest are even being auctioned off.  I believe that this kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur.  If they are unfortunately published, you and I ought to refrain from listening to or reading these works.

In short, I believe the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest.  Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.

These systems serve no purpose to the driver or the roads that they utilize.

I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.

And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang","I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow.

"Cmv: gay marriage is an important human rights issue that needs press and awareness. however, there is no important transgender issue and it does not deserve the same type of serious discussion.:","The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the word. That is a cause worth fighting for and a problem that needs rectifying. However, what exactly is there for transgendered people to fight for? It is already legal for people who want to to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity as much as scientifically possible. I have a few gay friends that resent the LGBT acronym and transgendered peoples' ""uninvited"" inclusion with the gay movement. They feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today. I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance want want their voices heard, but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.","The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the world.

A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now).

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.

The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.","The Cheesecake Factory is the granddaddy of big box food. Tasty? yes.

"Why is it ok for the media to invade people's privacy, but not ok the government or private citizens do?:","Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.

Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a ""probable cause"", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.","Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.

Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.
The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.","They aren't really on the same level.

There will be no health care, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship.

Diesel: fuel of the future?   stance: highly plausible:,"Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. No longer is it the loud smoke chugging brute of an engine.

Its not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however until we get more efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point.

2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors.
3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers.

"Why were stupid, senseless laws invented?:","Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed (for example a law forbidding to have meat, during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn the people about the dangers of eating that meat). What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful.

The one you mention (about singing in the bath) seems to have some kind of moral background. It seems stupid to us now. And it probably was stupid by the time it was passed, too. But it responded to the moral standards of that time.","Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless.

Why did the nazis hate the jews so much as to gas them?:,"It wasn't just the jews, hun.  

The nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin.  They were doing what they deemed right.  ""The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions"".  

They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category.

They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race.  They weren't exactly hating the people.  They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions.  We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily.  That's what the nazis did to various people groups.

Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a ""Harvest of Despair"".  You should watch the documentary below:","It wasn't just the jews, hun.

For example, ""Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population."" Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.

I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]

First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality.

Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

Similarly, so many credible sources of eyewitness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar (claimed to work at Area 51). I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and its all a big coverup but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited.

To ""be a man"" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of ""be more ladylike"". 

All it accomplishes is:  
* Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit   
* Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society   

It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are 'supposed' to have.

Why not have a gender neutral phrase? ""Be a better person""?","In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfill traditional gender roles. To ""be a man"" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of ""be more ladylike"".

Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.","Raising Cane's is a good choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious.

My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like.  (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.)  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying.  If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.","Technically IC Systems is liable, but you would probably have to go to small claims court to get them to pay.

Massachusetts melanie's law?:,"I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.

Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.

That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.

And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.","I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those who are passing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.

Has our government gone to far suspending habeus corpus?:,"This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society. We are now reduced to the level of a police state.

The President is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear' - as happens in facist dictatorships.","This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society.

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  

SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a ""Contigency"" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.  Contact your local bar association for a reference.","Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""?

Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.

Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you.

For this reason, i believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.","It is quite simple.

Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other insane stuff.

Christian B accepts that evolution is true, accepts that the whole concept of god as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person.

Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant.

Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:,"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do.

Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is ""Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?""  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.

"Cmv: if there is ever a major collapse of civilization, millions of people will be dead in weeks:","*EDIT* In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people.

For this view, I'm simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma.

Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system? If not, then I think 3 million type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse.","*EDIT* In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly.

"Cmv: schools should have to provide a quality lunch, free of charge to all students.:","School's are a government run institution, designed for the betterment of it's students.

As such it's only fair that schools should provide a free, quality lunch for it's pupils. 
For three primary reasons: 

1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours feed them.

2. If you want to curb obesity, 

3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.

As a person who just graduated highschool last year in the USA, the school lunches were expensive ($3) and crap, i knew many children whose lunch would consist of chips, candy, and soda, and refused to buy lunch either because they didn't' want to spend the money, or because the lunch was poor in quality.

"To negotiate with enemies or not?   stance: yes, diplomacy can help.:","The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best.

How can benefits from embryonic stem cell extraction outweigh its moral costs?:,"Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off...

Added after reading the answer below...WOW! Now, this is interesting...I am pro choice and the person below is clearly not, and yet on this issue we are in agreement... If a ""Pro Lifer"" and a ""Pro Choice Advocate"" are both saying, in essence, ""Hey, you don't need to create embroyos for this purpose, there is another perfectly viable source of stem cells, use it."" we have to be right, because usually we probably wouldn't be able to agree that water is wet.","Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off.

Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.","_____ I know that with science most people are now able to have children but I feel it is selfish.

2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.

When Prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.","Yes. It is safer than alcohol, it's nearly impossible to overdose on it, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. 

Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.

Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap.

Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington was a wonderful experience.

"If someone confesses that he committed a criminal acts, say killing someone, is it enough for the court to ..?:","Well, if that someone was under oath and was ""giving himself in"" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person!

Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.

Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.

Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God.  So God if your listening, Help Them!!!

The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:,"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","Firstly, it is the people of Singapore, not outsiders, who should make that decision.

Misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections?  So to answer the question yes I feel it does exonerate itself.","The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when it sees fit on whatever the matter might be.

The USA has laws in place that prohibits anyone from having to work in a hostile work environment.  The first step you need to take is to contact the human resource (or personnel) department of your workplace and tell them your story.  You need to write down what was said, the date it was said if you remember, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it.  If the human resource department does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office.  If this option is not available to you, I would consult with an attorney to determine what the next step is you should take.

Cmv: sub zero is way better than scorpion:,"Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold vs too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should ""get over himself!"" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of ""terrorism"" so in theory the ""war"" would never end since there will always be ""terrorism"" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

"Pledge of allegiance: forcing religion?   stance: do you think that saying ""under god"" is too religious for america?:","Yes....I feel it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period.
School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.
So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.
The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) .
Further, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.","Yes....I feel it is a little much.

Petitions?:,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. 

However, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. 

So the answer to your question is yes.

Hope this helped somewhat.","I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal.

Is it aganst gods law to look at naked woman on the internet?:,"No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.

So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.","No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Wow, that's tough.

They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.

Cmv: politicians should not be allowed to campaign through cold calls:,"I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion:
I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.  I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated).  Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).

I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.

Arizona Iced Tea (lemon): 24 grams of sugar in 8 oz.

Ingredients:

Arizona: tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor.
Coke: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine.

Their first two ingredients are basically identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets it from flavoring. They both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona again gets it from the tea leaves.

"Cmv: i have no ethical issue with so called ""anti homeless spikes"":","Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business.

Interesting question catch22 how fair and sane is this?:,"The stupid idea of ""You can't get an ID without an ID"". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.

I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!","The stupid idea of ""You can't get an ID without an ID"". Try to explain this to them and ask them for their opinion.

"Since liberalism=liberty and a liberal must be for freedom,what does a conservative or moderate person equal?:","Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are actually not followers of traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.

Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.","Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are not followers of traditional liberalism.

If your engine stalls or you have some other problem as you are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety. 2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it. 3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk. I think that the safest option is just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road.

The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.

First of all it is scripted and just meant for amusment. It is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality TV shows.

business name: caffe boa. city: tempe. categories: restaurants, italian, american (new), breakfast & brunch:","After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. 

We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.

Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)","I am sad to say I did not have a good experience there.

We might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seemingly don't hurt an individual, group, or society as a whole.

For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.

It can happen where the judge has never broken the law or even never actually done anything unethical -- just the appearance is enough to remove the judge sometimes.

Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

I really hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about this subject. Please pardon my ignorance if this comes off as so, but I would really like to learn a bit more about what might happen and maybe CMV.

Thanks!

The drinking age should be 18   stance: disagree:,"The drinking age should be 16. There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age.

If casual drinking is integrated into a society, it can seriously curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.","The drinking age should be 16.

There will be no war/military conflict between the united states of america and iran   stance: i agree because....:,There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.,"There is no disagreement, but I disagree.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.

Not that I advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society -murder, theft, rape, etc- all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. 






So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.

Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.

Cmv: it is hypocritical to criticize the use of burqas in the muslim religion while ignoring the inability for women to expose their breasts publicly within most countries.:,"I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.

In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.

He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to grasp.

Kids own a wardrobe of electronic gadgets too.  They are desensitized to content like death and sex at an earlier age.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

I hope this helps.","I do not know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view. Historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included.

If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or the other.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent.

So we really have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but it philosophically makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn.

Are we heading towards a global recession?   stance: yes:,"(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres.
(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.

"Remove ""in god we trust"" from currency, courts & other governmental institutions?   stance: no, it a motto we all should live by:","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
Your assertion is complex and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants, and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America.
For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without the stupid motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.
As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do with our money.
The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it. The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money?

Religion and proof   stance: religious people should provide proof for their beliefs if they promote it as truth:,"If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim.
If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof you're hiding the truth from him.You hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth,and quite frankly if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity Is their blood not on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn’t.

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.","Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.

However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up.
