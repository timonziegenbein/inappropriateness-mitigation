**EDIT**: Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. **I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHETHER A WOMAN SHOLD HAV AN ABORTION OR NOT**. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, **a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).**","Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.

business name: agincourt bakery. city: scarborough. categories: event planning & services, delis, caterers, italian, bakeries, food, restaurants:","Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try.  Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","I was hoping for a lot better than what I got, but I won't be returning.

On the other hand, I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way. And I do agree, why does it really matter so much to white Americans? You can't have this one word, you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing?

Should same sex marriages be legal?:,"This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.

Can the police keep your car permantly if you have 3rd suspended license?:,"Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?

If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.

That is a cause worth fighting for and a problem that needs rectifying. However, what exactly is there for transgendered people to fight for?

"Why is it ok for the media to invade people's privacy, but not ok the government or private citizens do?:","Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.
Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a ""probable cause"", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.","Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.

In ww2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting there guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure. Kids are being taught that they can gain points or a high score through human death and suffering.

2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors.
3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers.

And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed. For example a law forbidding the consumption of meat during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn people about the dangers of eating that meat. What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful. The one you mention (about singing in the bath) seems to have some moral background.

Cmv: higher insurance rates for young men is sexist.:,"Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. 

For example, ""Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population."" Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.

I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient.

Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.

Also, if you dont have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.","I believe that you need a fence around any pool in Ohio.

What are the shorcomings of any public opinion poll?:,"The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.

The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  

SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a ""Contigency"" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.

"Cmv: i enjoy paying my taxes, think taxes are a good thing, and i do not understand being against taxes on principal (save as a miserly attempt to hold on to more money) cmv:","Pretty much what it says in the title. I'll explain further by saying that I believe that government is a good thing, the consciousness of society when done right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails.
So what am I missing? Why is a good government a government that governs least, and thus needs less money? Who ever heard of a structures that does it's purpose best by doing it least.

"Cmv: if you marry a famous and wealthy male, you are irrational if you are surprised by infidelity.:","Its quite simple. 

Men who very wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.

Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you.

But still, the people choose, and that is where they combine and is the same: it is the people who vote and choose ""the chosen ones"".

Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:,"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic.

Do you think that people who drive while talking on cell phones should be arrested?:,"Should they be arrested? No, but there should definately be a huge fine!! I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.

Hands free phones don't help that much either.  You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.  The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. 

"" Texas was Mexico's""

Cmv: i believe that most psychedelic drugs should be legal:,"I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.

Obviously when I say ""psychedelics"" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive.

"Cmv: if there is ever a major collapse of civilization, millions of people will be dead in weeks:","*EDIT* In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people.

For this view, I'm simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma.

Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system?

If Cricket is to survive as a sport, then we need to get rid of games that last 3 days and don't always have a winner. et rid of the boring whites and boring defensive play. Only the old guard and a tiny fraction of Cricket fans like this form of Cricket.
People would rather pay £40 to go see 20 overs of cricket full of 6's and 4's and lots of wickets, rather than sit there a full day and see one wicket and only singles.
If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment.
Test Cricket is dying out, lets whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it.
Roll on Twenty20!!!","Test cricket is dying out, let's whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it.

Why do u think date rape is on the rise today?:,"a number of reasons..
because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night parties
because guys are  ""lacing"" drinks with drugs quite easily 
because the media portrays ""a good time"" for young people  as"" having sex""
and uncool to go without it 
because girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for
because the ""safety antena"" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim

thus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. 
so girls need to take care, be aware of your own safety dont give ""strange"" guys the upperhand if you dont want to be date raped..","There are many reasons why girls are out looking for a good time with guys in the wrong places, like the bar or disco or late night parties because guys are easily influenced by alcohol or drugs.

Society, for whatever reason, just expected them too get married young and have loads of children. According to most of what I've been told, people were married at the latest by their mid-20's and even that was considered late. Divorce at this time was unheard of, so if your partner changed, (as most people do) then you were just kind of stuck with someone you didn't like. I don't believe that someone is cognitively ready to make a lifelong decision at that age and most people of this time period got married to pacify their parents, society, whatever in an outdated social institution that was just left over from the middle ages. I know it sounds really grim so CMV?

"Decriminalizing pot, good or bad?   stance: good:","I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery.
There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:
1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.
2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.
I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.","I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana.

Should marijuana be legalized?   stance: yes:,"Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.","Yes. It is safer than alcohol, it is nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal, it would be easier to regulate.

Isn't entrapment by trying to get clerks or waitresses to sell alcohol to a minor illegal?:,"First, my expertise.  I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation.

It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol.  It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him.  The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.  If the decoy just says to the clerk, ""Oh, come on!"" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.","First, my expertise.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

So, if you don't show up in thesuit you don't know about can they win a judgment?  Yes.
But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money.  How will they enforce the judgment?  If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can sieze those.  But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money.

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age.

Cmv: am/pm time is pointless; it would be simpler and more straightforward if everyone started using 24 hour time (e.g. 18:00 vs 6:00pm).:,"If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12 hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time.

I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like ""am"". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.)

From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hr clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.","If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a twelve hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time.

Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","It was a great experience.

And even if he declines to represent you, it does not necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general. It just means that it isn't worth it to him. If he feels you have no case, he will tell you that also.

"If someone confesses that he committed a criminal acts, say killing someone, is it enough for the court to ..?:","Well, if that someone was under oath and was ""giving himself in"" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person!

Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.

Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.

Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God.  So God if your listening, Help Them!!!

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","I disagree.

Misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections?  So to answer the question yes I feel it does exonerate itself.","The Church tends to exonerate itself whenever it can, on whatever matter it may be. I don't see where this would be no different.

Schools should not use the same routine for every student. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be.

Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.","Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creationism, while there is massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.

"Pledge of allegiance: forcing religion?   stance: do you think that saying ""under god"" is too religious for america?:","Yes....I feel it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period.
School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.
So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.
The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) .
Further, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.","I agree that it is excessive and a form of indoctrination.

Petitions?:,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. 

However, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. 

So the answer to your question is yes.

Is it aganst gods law to look at naked woman on the internet?:,"No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.

So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

Cmv: politicians should not be allowed to campaign through cold calls:,"I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion:
I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.  I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated).  Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).

I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.

"Cmv: i have no ethical issue with so called ""anti homeless spikes"":","Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.","I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called ""anti-homeless"" spikes.

Why do they allow us to use limewire when every download you make is copyright infringement?:,"Not every download is copyright infringment.

If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them.

Also, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in volation of copyright laws.

So, there are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used. And as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker doesn't intend or support illegal use to occur -- the software itself is not illegal.

But using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.","Not every download is copyright infringement.

"Since liberalism=liberty and a liberal must be for freedom,what does a conservative or moderate person equal?:","Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are actually not followers of traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.

Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.","Just so you know, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of stability.

Cmv: i think vehicles that stop at every train crossing put themselves at greater risk than not stopping at all.:,"Of course, stop if a train is there.

I think of this every time I see a truck/bus with ""This vehicle stops at all railroad crossings"" written across the back... I feel that stopping, listening for a train, and going again is much riskier than not stopping at train crossings. I feel this way for 3 reasons:

1. If your engine stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety.

2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it.

3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk.

I think that the safest option just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road.

"Business review: 1.0 stars
business name: caffe boa. city: tempe. categories: restaurants, italian, american (new), breakfast & brunch:","After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. 

We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.

Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)","I am sad to say I did not have a good experience at Caffe Boa. First off, let me say I did not taste any food.

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia.

Can a mobile phone bring about contempt of court?:,"Is it possible, sure.  Your question is difficult to answer because it really depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge.  Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service.

In the eyes of the law..can a woman rape a man?:,"Legally yes it can and has happened. The imfamous urban legend of Biker chicks knocking a guy down and having thier way with him in a park is an example. 

The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by deffinition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have  little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. 

A guy weak enough to be ""raped"" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.","Legally, yes it can and has happened.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a ""triple-dog dare,"" authorities said. 

The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. 

Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. 

Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. 

When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend ""triple-dog dared"" them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.","There is NOTHING on the planet more binding than that of the Triple Dog Dare.

Cmv: it is hypocritical to criticize the use of burqas in the muslim religion while ignoring the inability for women to expose their breasts publicly within most countries.:,"I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.

In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

_____

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.

Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent.

So we really have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but it philosophically makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn.

Are we heading towards a global recession?   stance: yes:,"(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres.
(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.

"Remove ""in god we trust"" from currency, courts & other governmental institutions?   stance: no, it a motto we all should live by:","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
Your assertion is complex and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants, and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America.
For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without the stupid motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.
As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do with our money.
The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it. The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.","I don't see the point in making a change from an economic standpoint.

Religion and proof   stance: religious people should provide proof for their beliefs if they promote it as truth:,"If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim.

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.","Evolution is backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
