How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection.

And that's true, but what makes it superior to other games is the fact that it has a great story.

If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money.

Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.

Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.

Why did the us refuse to sign that environmental agreement with other countries?:,"Bush assumes it will put US at risk of loosing the edge in industrial production.
The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in america.

I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law was around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted.

Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.","The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is clear that if someone uses another person's computer service, in this case, a broadband connection, without their consent, he committed an offence.

"Question about pleading ""temporary insanity"".?:","If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings.  It generally would not apply to a civil proceeding.  However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare.  Some states do not allow it at all.  Others, just like the ""permanent"" insanity defense, restrict it considerably.  

Mental anguish is a tort.  I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim.  The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO.

Should parents be allowed to reprimand their children via spanking/smacking?   stance: yes.:,"Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.","Yes, I do believe that in the early stages of life, the physical punishment is more effective than the verbal punishment.

Its simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to this christian country.

Should capital punishment be allowed?:,"To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared captial punishment to abortion:

The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.

What are the shorcomings of any public opinion poll?:,"The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.  The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has a bias as well.  The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do.
The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.
In short, polls will never be 100% helpful until they are designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention whatsoever.  But what's the fun in that?","In short, polls will never be 100% helpful unless they are designed, carried out and conducted with practically no human intervention at all. But what's the fun of that?

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  

SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a ""Contigency"" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.  Contact your local bar association for a reference.","You mean ""employee"" or ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, an employee can be dismissed for any reason or no reason.

We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say “drafted” when we could say “slave soldier” or “drug confiscation” when we could say “theft of herbs”. These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.

One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish inquisition is to us.","There are hundreds of states on this planet, and all of them are involved in initiating aggression against the people they control. Sometimes, for example, a criminal is justified by the fact that he is being held. But the state is often the initiator of the aggression, and that is usually justified by the fact that it is being committed by the state.

Do lesbians have it easier than gay men??   stance: lesbians are more socially accepted by straight people:,"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)","In a traditional society, which is still dominated by men, the general consensus of men is more popular than the general consensus of women, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be sexy because there is no male in the picture.

The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing feild to noobies alongside more experienced players.
The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc.

I encountered bafflement.  ""Any particular disability?"" I was asked.  I have a son who has been disabled since the age of twelve.  He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting.  He has seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.","I've been in a position where I had to recruit a typing machine, and I had to explain to the HR department that perhaps this was a job that could be offered to a disabled person who might otherwise have difficulty finding employment, and I was astonished at the fact that they had no idea how to treat it.

They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.","I haven't been to a Sizzler in a while, but the food and service are pretty good. The salad bar is pretty full, and they have four soups, and the chicken rice gone wild was the best of them all. The French onion was good, too. And the salads were full of vegetables, and you could always ask for more. The food is good value for the price.

The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display.

I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.","I'd like to think that Duchamp's Fountain was an early and successful example of asking the question, ""what art is"", but it hasn't been done in the gallery since.

Cmv: head to head results should be a higher world cup group play tiebreaker than goals scored.:,"First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).

EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.","First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor in Group G is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.

Cmv: i think that outsourcing to china isn't all that bad:,"The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed. ","I admit that I am limited in my understanding of the necessity of outsourcing American projects to China in order to ensure that Chinese families can survive without any active effort to alleviate poverty. If a family loses their jobs, they cannot afford to eat, rent or buy clothes. Furthermore, if the outsourcing is eliminated, prices in the world would increase dramatically, which would affect people who are currently living on the edge of poverty themselves.

2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

Your Friend,
Francesois","Dear Friend, I don't know if I agree with your question, but I think it's a systematic suspicion of certain minorities that is a crime.

Anything else that you legally have to be of a certain age for, like car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, flying, etc., requires ID, so why not something as important as voting? Then again, some people say it's discriminatory, even comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe's laws. I don't think it's discriminatory, I think it's just a discriminatory thing to do.

Cmv: am/pm time is pointless; it would be simpler and more straightforward if everyone started using 24 hour time (e.g. 18:00 vs 6:00pm).:,"If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12 hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time.

I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like ""am"". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.)

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Cmv: i think youtube's possible takeover of twitch is a good thing.:,"Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game.

Youtube could also be then catering to a wider audience, thus making Youtube bigger.

If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time;) 

What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.","It's just a typical Greek restaurant, Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth, and if you want a traditional chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, salad, rice and tzaziki, then go for it.

Is the school uniform a good or bad idea:,"Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality.

For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Wow, that's a lot of work. Is it your job to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you think of it yourself?

"Since liberalism=liberty and a liberal must be for freedom,what does a conservative or moderate person equal?:","Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are actually not followers of traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.

Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.","They don't follow traditional liberalism, but some libertarians and some republics follow it. They don't like to change the status quo, the stability of society, but they do not want to see a complete anarchy, but rather a strong government protecting the people.

Don't bother consulting a lawyer on this one.  It would cost you too much.  This is exactly what small claims is designed for -- someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved.

Sue.  On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief.  Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name.  Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you.

"Cmv: i think as long as you have a well paying job, job satisfaction doesn't matter at all.:","I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the shittiest job on earth,  you should be content.

Example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I make 60-70k a year and enjoyed the 8 hour day.

I feel this way because in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life.

Cmv: i believe current euro skepticism will lead to the dissolution of the eu and eventually more turmoil in the region.:,"Hi everyone,

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia.

Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

Teachers are overpaid   stance: teachers are overpaid:,"The average salary of an american is 32,000$

In wisconsin, the salary including benefits is 75,000$

I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire.
Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school.
I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman', because it sheds light on the many imperfections of our failing public school system.
The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, the US has some of the lowest scores.","The average US teacher's salary is $32,000, and the average US teacher's salary is $53,000.

Gravity as einstein depicts does not exist.   stance: einstein is wrong.:,"Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?

This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the ""ultimate sagging mattress"" that is often alluded to.
Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions.
2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes.
3. It can never work with quantum physics.
4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum?
5. Other theories are far more logical, but have been gunned down by conservative physicists.","Why do we still think Einstein's view of the universe is correct, because he feels that all matter warps space-time, but that doesn't make him right.

Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option.

Nope.","We have one of the strongest navies on earth, and we've got 366 military vessels in the vicinity of this dangerous area.

There will be no war/military conflict between the united states of america and iran   stance: i agree because....:,There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.,"There's no disagreement, but I disagree. There's a good chance that the United States and Iran will have a war or conflict, and that's why they hate the West and support terrorist organizations.

The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by deffinition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have  little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. 

A guy weak enough to be ""raped"" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.","Legally yes, and it has happened.

Cmv:i think professional soccer players who over exaggerate injuries should receive a yellow card.:,"I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. 

Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off.

The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent.

For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's ""regular"" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

I hope this helps.","I'm not sure this fits in with your emphasis, but I think it's important to remember that women were not included in the definition of human rights in the past..

Cmv: i believe uk universities are uninspiring and have lost their true meaning.:,"
_____

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.       ","_ In my last year of university, I found that the university environment was not inspiring.

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
