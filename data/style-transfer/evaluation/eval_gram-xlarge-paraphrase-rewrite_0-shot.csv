Why do russian people hate foreigners in their country?:,I would say not all foreigners ..maybe unrealistic but it would depend on what country they are from ..er which country..Just as the entire world has favs and non favs.. I think the non favs for countries already know who they are and why...If a nation is violent and not good for the world and the government..lies and steals..and kills innocent humans..well then.. it is not well liked ..or the people either..because the government is suppose to represent the people..So...it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.,"I'd say it depends on the country they're from, just like everybody in the world has their favorites and dislikes. I think the disliked countries already know who they are and why. If a nation is violent and bad for the world and the government lies and steals and kills innocent people, then it's not popular, nor are its people, because the government is supposed to be representing them. So it's the government that causes this and its people who pay for it.

The only one playing god is the man with the gun.   stance: agree:,"I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceeded the need for natural selection.

"Do dogs have the capacity to remember   stance: dogs have the capacity for remembering people, places and objects:","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning.
Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.","The general opinion is that if dogs have the capacity to remember, it is only for short periods of time.

Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","I was hoping for a lot more than mediocre but I got less than mediocre. I won't be going back.

Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.

Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below.  It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California.

You really need to stop driving.  Really.","You're not getting the point, are you? If you're from California, you can bet the cops can seize your car and it won't take three times to get it right.

If a wealthy businessman decides to go into politics, he should give up his money and all other non-essential things, so that he can prove that he's not in it for the money, but for the job. I know it's unlikely that this will be implemented, don't use it as an argument.

Why does the government have the right to enact 'morals' laws?:,"First of all, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the ""pursuit (or persuit) of happiness"".  That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.  On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law?  I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds?  In other words, how do you draw a line?","First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the right to ""pursuit or pursuit of happiness"", that expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.

"If prostitution is illegal, how can it be legal to pay two people to have sex and film it in a porn movie?:","The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats.

The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts are hard to see.

It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially.

I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention.

She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. 

There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. 

The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

Cmv: the us should be partitioned because good governance is not likely at the scale of 300 million people:,"The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control.

Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy.

They feel like I should be ""grateful"" for my grades, despite the fact that I put in a lot more planning and writing into the work I submit. In the past I've usually had someone to compete with, but now I don't have that, and it makes me feel like it's just me."" Am I being a bitch, or is there a legitimate reason for me to feel that my achievements are being undervalued because people are expecting me to get great grades?

Cmv: star wars episodes i iii are better than iv vi:,"Just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable.  

The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV.  

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.

Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.

I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar).  I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.","I've just finished watching all 3 seasons in a row, and I have to say that the first 3 were more enjoyable for me.

Ordered the holy smokes with frees and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.

The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify the price for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper!

I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get it again because of that.","The burgers were good, but the price was too high for what it is.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.","I know that most countries that allow abortion allow it only in the first trimester of pregnancy, when the fetus isn't even called 'fetus' anymore, but 'embryo', which, if you've seen pictures of, doesn't even look like a human, and has no brain function, so it can't feel pain, and doesn't know it's there (for those who want to know how you can be sure, I can only say that I'm not, and that's just what I know). By then, the fetus is pretty much a person, though it can't live on its own, and it's a crime to remove it.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.","I've not visited a Sizzler in a long time, but the food and service here was great.

That is, you have AI system that you give some objective, and it takes over everything, improving itself, rearranging your atoms to its will, all to fulfill what seemed like a mundane objective function of making paperclips.  Anyway, I do not think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research.  To me it seems the focus (with deep learning etc) is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers.

Cmv: fuck the police:,"Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst.

In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

"Cmv: community colleges and commuter colleges provide an inferior socialization experience when compared to a university located in a ""college town"".:","To keep this a narrowly focused conversation I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded from this discussion. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a ""college town"" considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion. 
__________________________________________________________

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. 

Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.

Cmv: cheap foreign labor is brought in by gov't/business to depress the wages of the countries workforce:,"If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages. CMV","If there is a high unemployment rate, as there is today in most developed countries, why would there be a need for more low wage workers? Increasing the number of workers when the labour market is not growing only increases competition for fewer jobs, which employers will try to fill with the lowest waged workers.

To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.

Cmv: intellectual property should be defended as a right:,"The usual con-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge.

However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.

"Abortion   stance: no, should be illegal:","As a Catholic i have to say that it should be illegal. Because it is against my religion to kill innocent babies.

From other religions it might be against your religion.
but i still believe that it should be illegal.
If you know you can't support your baby you should put it up for adoption.
I also think that the government should be putting more money into adoption agencies and less into seniors.
I know that seniors have been alive and been important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future.

Jack thompson   stance: do you think that jack thompson is right. that video games are the reason more and more young people:,"Violence is perpetuated and caused by society.
Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.

We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live.

The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:,"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Evolution vs. creation   stance: evolution:,"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence.

Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally).

What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute.

Once again, the federal government gives out millions to states who pass certain laws, this is one of them.  And if everyone did their research before they answered this question, they would know that it is not the 18-20 age group that ranks highest in drunk driving.  Change the drunk driving law, first offense:attempted murder.  In my opinion that is exactly what they are doing.  But punishing adults?  Give me a break.  I know repsonsible 18 year olds, and yet my dad who is 57 is a drunk and always has been.  Age has nothing to do with it.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you just think of this on your own?

Sadism is the most evil thing a human can indulge in.   stance: yes:,"Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is ""evil"".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just ""assisted"" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
Pick this apart at your will.","I think sadism is the most disgusting thing a person can do, because he has to hurt someone else to get some personal or sexual pleasure. To do that, you have to be subjugated, which makes you weaker than the one who is actively hurting you, which makes the pain even worse. That's ""evil"". But if both people are willing to participate in the pain, then it's probably masochism, albeit at the hands of another. This might sound like an odd statement, but if you pursue pain and violence, and then receive it at the hands of another, isn't that ""assisted"" masochism? (like assisted suicide). Even if these people are weird, I don't think that matters to me what they do in private.

Cmv: affirmative action policies encourage the prejudice they seek to prevent.:,"Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background.

","The goal of affirmative action is to level the playing field and give every student a chance to go to college, no matter their background. Basing that aid on skin color, while changing a possibly disadvantageful historical stereotype, does not achieve that goal. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? While many schools do, some schools that have to fill ""race quotas"" to ""diversify the campus"" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.

business name: chi ko roo. city: toronto. categories: food, breakfast & brunch, american (traditional), restaurants:","It was just ok for me, at best.  The menu is large but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like.  My friend had a burger and fries and I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries.  You get a salad first - I had caesar and my friend had garden.  The caesar salad was the highlight of my meal!  It was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicy.  My friend seemed to like the garden salad ok but it looked pretty basic to me - mostly lettuce.

My friend enjoyed his burger and I have to say it did look like a good burger.  My sandwich came out cold, which is not a good start to a toasted sandwich.  It might have been pretty good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland.  The sweet potato fries were good, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs.  

It's true - the portion sizes are huge.  But I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.","The food was ok, nothing special. The portions are huge, but I don't make my food decisions solely on calories.

If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement.  If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay.  If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to ""time served"", then the County can seek reimbursement.

For those who do dress differently they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style and this is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.","Unless the federal government is directly controlled, states and localities have the power to make such laws within their own jurisdictions, which usually reflect local perceptions of decency and civility.

I'm a bit of a snob, probably as many people are, and I love my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold CDs, or LPs, but my ears probably can't tell the difference. And certainly I love plugging an iPod full of mp3s into my fancy car audio system.

Cmv: i believe current euro skepticism will lead to the dissolution of the eu and eventually more turmoil in the region.:,"Hi everyone,

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. 

Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

The US should have the highest test scores, but due to the fact that we have an abundance of average teachers who can't be fired, we don't. Instead, we have some of the lowest scores.

Gravity as einstein depicts does not exist.   stance: einstein is wrong.:,"Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?

This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the ""ultimate sagging mattress"" that is often alluded to.
Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions.
2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes.
3. It can never work with quantum physics.
4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum?
5. Other theories are far more logical, but have been gunned down by conservative physicists.","Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?

Unfortunately, our system is unique in the world, it's a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go rather than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully, in the future, people will see that this is a mess and somebody will fix it.

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5).

The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision and people should be satisfied with that.    ","I've learned after doing my research and talking to friends and family that this issue is very important to parents. In my opinion, parents should decide whether or not children are vaccinated. Some people do not get vaccinated and live long, healthy lives, others do and the same thing happens. I think this is due to biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick, but so do not vaccinated people. My conclusion is that people should not be forced to vaccinate their children if they do not wish to. They should be informed about the benefits and drawbacks of their decision, make an informed decision, and be satisfied.

This is an agency. This is a cliche.

Religion and proof   stance: religious people should provide proof for their beliefs if they promote it as truth:,"If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim.

If you can’t offer proof of your beliefs thats ok, just don’t promote it as truth, promote it as belief.","If you're promoting your religion as absolute truth, you need evidence to back up your claim.

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.","Evolution is backed by science, including DNA tracing, and archaaeological findings such as Lucy.

My date had prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of meat in it I believe. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium.

However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it.

(Tried 2 curries and pad Thai) But that's not why I gave this place 5 stars. After my girlfriend ordered her curry a little too spicy for her taste (and ate a good amount), we asked the waiter if he could lessen the spice and he left to the kitchen only to return with a brand new curry (and rice) cooked with less spice. 

Oh and we got free ice cream! How cool is that!?!","I had two curries and pad Thai and all were very good, but the reason I gave it five stars is because the waiter was kind enough to take the spice level down from what my girlfriend requested (which she ate quite a bit of) and then brought back a new curry and rice that had less spice.
