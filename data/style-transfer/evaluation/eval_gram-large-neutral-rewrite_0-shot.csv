Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to ""fix"" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! Scary stuff.

If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. 

**EDIT**: Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. **I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHETHER A WOMAN SHOLD HAV AN ABORTION OR NOT**. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, **a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).**","Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy.

How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity.

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try. Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods.

Cmv: israel should have been established within the borders of germany as an independent state following the second world war.:,"The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option.

"Cmv: sex should be treated as just an activity that people do, like fishing or watching a movie.:","Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:

1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 

2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 
3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc.

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.

The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.","The granddaddy of big box food. Tasty? yes. Inventive? not really.

The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.,"It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up.

Cmv: i don't see why attending graduation ceremony is such a big deal.:,"Reason being: 
-My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelors is a drop in the bucket in that area as prestige comes when a PhD is reached normally. 
-It is a normal event in life for people who are serious about a future and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising. 
-I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing.
-The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as vigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.

Bleach vs fullmetal alchemist   stance: fullmetal alchemist:,"They aren't really on the same level.
Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.
FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.
Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.
The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.","They aren't really on the same level.

"Better retail website, ebay or amazon?   stance: ebay is the retail website for me:","Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers I would say eBay is better from an economic perspective.

In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency.

We asked for chips and salsa she said they only have nachos.  We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us.  So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was ""it's not on the menu"".

"Question about pleading ""temporary insanity"".?:","If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings.  It generally would not apply to a civil proceeding.  However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare.  Some states do not allow it at all.  Others, just like the ""permanent"" insanity defense, restrict it considerably.  

Mental anguish is a tort.  I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim.  The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO.

The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state.  For the most accurate information, you should consult an attorney who is licensed in your state.  If you need a referral, contact your local or state bar association.","If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.

"Cmv: the moustache, facial hair in general, has become the embodiment of evil and the harbinger of bad times.:","There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more.

To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism.

Cmv: star wars episodes i iii are better than iv vi:,"Just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable.  

The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV.  

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.

Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.

I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar).  I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.","I just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable.

Should parents be allowed to reprimand their children via spanking/smacking?   stance: yes.:,"Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course.

The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.

Massachusetts melanie's law?:,"I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason.

Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.

That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""?

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.

Just look at the hundreds of videos of vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. It's disgusting.

Cmv: i respect everyones right to freedom of religion but that doesnt mean i should take seriously a religion which makes no sense at all.:,"Example:

Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other insane stuff.

Christian B accepts that evolution is true, accepts that the whole concept of god as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person.

Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I dont see how you can not take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take christian fundies seriously.","example: Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other stuff.

Are most forms of beauty an aspect of our sense of patterns?   stance: most things we consider beautiful are so because they match a pattern:,"Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion.

I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.","Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion.

Rainbow six vegas vs gears of war   stance: rainbow six is far superior !:,"I actually think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system.
The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic (being based in a much mearer future with less technological assumptions made).
The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing feild to noobies alongside more experienced players.
The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc.
And GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.","I actually think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.","Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

The argument is also proven false by the fact that soda has existed long before the current obesity epidemic, and soda has gradually gotten more expensive over the years and consumption hasn't dropped enough to prove that pricing is a huge factor

I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a *police* impound lot.

I might seem like a cynic and a skeptic but there is nothing I believe in more than I believe in love, the love of my parents, the love of my siblings, the love of my wife, the love of my kids, and the love that I feel for all of them in return.","Yes, it isn't that tough, my grandma got married for about 50 and that only ended because she died.

Is test cricket dying out?   stance: yes:,"With one day Cricket (40 overs) and Twenty20 Cricket (20 overs) taking a hold on the Cricket world, bringing much needed excitement and flair to the game it is time for Test Cricket to step down.
If Cricket is to survive as a sport, then we need to get rid of games that last 3 days and don't always have a winner. et rid of the boring whites and boring defensive play. Only the old guard and a tiny fraction of Cricket fans like this form of Cricket.
People would rather pay £40 to go see 20 overs of cricket full of 6's and 4's and lots of wickets, rather than sit there a full day and see one wicket and only singles.
If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment.
Test Cricket is dying out, lets whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it.

Why do u think date rape is on the rise today?:,"a number of reasons..
because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night parties
because guys are  ""lacing"" drinks with drugs quite easily 
because the media portrays ""a good time"" for young people  as"" having sex""
and uncool to go without it 
because girls dont think their safety is their priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for
because the ""safety antena"" of girls arent as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim

thus date rape is a consequence of all these factors.

Sentencing criminals???:,"I think people sent to prison for drug abuse should be in rehab centers.  Note, that's drug abuse, not selling drugs. Drug dealers should have prison time, but the punishment should fit the circumstances.

As for murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher.  And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.","I think people sent to prison for drug abuse should be in rehab centers.

Why is marijuana illegal?!?:,"It's not legal because it can't be regulated by the government, because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use), and because, since it hasn't always been legal like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it-- which would lead to increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality-- and all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legit job-- so it'd also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sale, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics.

Certainly changes need to be made but not in the way it's being approached now. I don't think I've heard one coherent argument.

Cmv: cheering for the country or city that your from in sports events is no different than cheering for a team based on their skin colour.:,"You have no control over what city or country you're from like you have no control over what colour your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play. 

Example: Im Canadian (so will obviously use hockey), Montreal Canadiens are the only Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race. Almost everybody I know has started cheering for them simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race. 

I feel the same for people passionately cheering for a team for their whole life. I find it closes the individuals mind to how good another team could be performing and pass it off as luck when really it's just their blinding biased.","You have no control over what city or country you're from like you have no control over what colour your skin is.

My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have.

My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves.

"Decriminalizing pot, good or bad?   stance: good:","I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery.
There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:
1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.
2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.
I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.","I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.

Should marijuana be legalized?   stance: yes:,"Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate.

Can a person who gives a gift (birthday)to a recepient have the right to take it back once gifted?:,"Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the gp will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property.

Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, Exceptions for responding to call from home and domestic violence.

In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet.

the problem with drug use is.. you are covering one problem with another.. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs...

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages.

To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home.

Cmv: intellectual property should be defended as a right:,"The usual con-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge. Knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.

Should you kill one innocent person to save the lives of more innocent people?   stance: yes (utilitarianism):,"As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. So, for those who don't know much philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who know much about philosophy, there will also be a debate within the debate.
I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.
My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them.
My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.","As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it.

Jack thompson   stance: do you think that jack thompson is right. that video games are the reason more and more young people:,"Violence is perpetuated and caused by society.
Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.
The news makes us distrust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with.
We have people screaming at salesmen- why? Because we don't see them as the same as us. What makes a telemarketer so evil but the high pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone.
We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live.
It's not video games, it's televison programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.","Violence is perpetuated and caused by society.

Teen love vs. lust   stance: teens can fall in love:,"Love is nothing more then a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? Atleast for a period of time. Look at adults. Some of them fall in love, get married, and then divorce. It is the same thing with teens only slightly different. Love comes a while after teens are together.
I can agree with an argue that says teens are only interested in each other for a while and then the attraction decreases into nothing. The few that do stay together after that initial reaction fades. Who is to say that it isn't love? Who is to say that teens are too young to feel that way?","Love is nothing more then a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? Atleast for a period of time.

The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:,"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - CMV. edit: by academic I meant something along the lines of 'A recognised subject matter expert with relevant experience' rather than implying only university professors could hold office.

Evolution vs. creation   stance: evolution:,"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.","Debates are based on convincing evidence.

If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.

Legal advice about payable on death issue?:,"Dear Friend,

Do not let them do this.  A person listed as ""payable on death"" has ZERO interest in your account while you are still alive.  They just get any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive.  Let them know you'll get a lawyer if they don't change their tune -- and that it'll cost them a LOT more than $800.  Bank stealing money from innocent children?  Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Wow, that's tough.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business.

"Cmv: i think 'pro life' is a fallacious term and the position should more accurately be called ""anti choice"":","The difference between ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.

Cmv: there is no obligation refer to nobility by their titles/honorifics.:,"It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as ""Doctor,"" ""your honor,"" or ""Captain."" In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.

However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, majesty, Prince, ect.). Why?

(1) Nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not.
(2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.

Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both.

Why aren't we held responsible for our reaction time when operating a motor vehicle?:,"It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.

I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. 

I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.","I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad.

The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure.

At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good).  Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler.  Legislators try to take the middle path.

Cmv:there's nothing wrong with being gay and engaging in homosexual acts.:,"I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason for condemning it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true and thus biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong their should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality. The prevailing justification seems to be that homosexual acts are not natural. However, this employs the assumption that what is natural is good. This doesn't seem true to me. Vaccines are not natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are unnatural and yet they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic.","I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason for condemning it as immoral.

The drinking age should be 18   stance: disagree:,"The drinking age should be 16. There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age.

Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.","The drinking age should be 16.

Can a mobile phone bring about contempt of court?:,"Is it possible, sure.  Your question is difficult to answer because it really depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge.  Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service.

In the eyes of the law..can a woman rape a man?:,"Legally yes it can and has happened. The imfamous urban legend of Biker chicks knocking a guy down and having thier way with him in a park is an example. 

The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by deffinition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have  little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. 

A guy weak enough to be ""raped"" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.","Legally yes it can and has happened.

Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

Cmv: it is hypocritical to criticize the use of burqas in the muslim religion while ignoring the inability for women to expose their breasts publicly within most countries.:,"I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.

In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender.

If he/she were to be set free and thus cause more deaths on the population it is justified to take his life for the general good. They are against violence, random and senseless violence that is. Sanctioned killings whereby a person has commited crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

Cmv: socialism is better than capitalism:,"    I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by.

    In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed.

    According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?

EDIT: Thank you for all your answers and apologies for not being so clear.

Cmv: catch and release fishing is immoral.:,"I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, faught, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. 

In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water. 

I cant find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. 

At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.

Your assertion is complex and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants, and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America.
For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without the stupid motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.
As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do with our money.
The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it. The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money?

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.","Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
