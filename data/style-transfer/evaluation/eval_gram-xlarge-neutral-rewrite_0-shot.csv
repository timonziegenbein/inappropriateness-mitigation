Can anyone help me with creating a bill to be passed for my government class?:,"OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license.  We need the law because a standard drivers license will make the country more secure against terrorists.  Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill.  The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address.  The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security.  The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues.  It will actually remove a burden from the states.","OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license.

"Cmv: i believe that the ""my body, my choice"" argument is a double standard, and that men should have the legal right to opt out of any and all child support.:","Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy.

If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. 

**EDIT**: Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. **I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHETHER A WOMAN SHOLD HAV AN ABORTION OR NOT**. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, **a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).**","Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy.

How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity.

My girlfriend recommended it.  The fries are yummy. Very fresh.  But I wouldn't go there for the fries.  They have bags of peanuts that you can put into little paper bowls and munch on while you wait so thats kinda cute.  The decor is like a 50's diner.  So if you like big juicy burgers than yeah, go here.  Me personally, its a no.","I guess its good food if you're one of those people who like big burgers, but not me. I find it over rated.

business name: agincourt bakery. city: scarborough. categories: event planning & services, delis, caterers, italian, bakeries, food, restaurants:","Since this place is close to where i live and it showed good yelp ratings i figured i would give it a try.  Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","Since this place is close to where i live and it had good yelp ratings i figured I would give it a try. Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods.

Should same sex marriages be legal?:,"This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.

Can the police keep your car permantly if you have 3rd suspended license?:,"Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, you're just not getting the message, are you?

If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.

"Cmv: sex should be treated as just an activity that people do, like fishing or watching a movie.:","Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:

1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 

2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 
3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. 

I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society.

But the better team doesn't always win. 

And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.

The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.

Why not?

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.

It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.

","After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup wasn't signed that is, one partner usually receive alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job. CMV!

Cmv: i think the concept of sociological 'privilege' is damaging when used anywhere outside a sociology book:,"As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.

I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.","As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.

Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media seems illogical to me. 

In ww2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting there guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure.

- Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some.

She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her to get drinks.  There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why! 
 
We asked for chips and salsa she said they only have nachos.  We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us.  So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was ""it's not on the menu"".  I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, she told me I was being confrontational.  I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes.

Have animal activists really gone into malls and ruined articles of clothing made from fur?:,"Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice.

2. Completely false/made up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region (as we are seeing now) for decades.

Should parents be allowed to reprimand their children via spanking/smacking?   stance: yes.:,"Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.","Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course.

What are the shorcomings of any public opinion poll?:,"The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.

The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.

To answer the previous post, the President can declare ANYONE, not just foreigners, a ""person who might be aiding terrorists"", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. Effectively, this has entirely negated habeas corpus. 

The President is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear' - as happens in facist dictatorships.","This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society.

business name: chipotle mexican grill. city: phoenix. categories: food, fast food, mexican, restaurants:","Frequent customer at this chipotle! It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the happy valley round about which can get super busy when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also busy so the line gets lunch especially at lunch time but is typically pretty fast. 

Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us and asks us about our day.

I switch off from a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price. 

Love having a healthy quick option to go eat lunch or dinner. Would definitely recommend this to others (: 

Oh and 1 thing I don't like.... it's always super cold in here. Haha so bring a jacket.","Frequent customer at this chipotle! It is nice and close to my house.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think).

Gun control?:,"Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just ""feel good"" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant)

And for the record, the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a governement that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.","Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just ""feel good"" legislation.

Laws would be the same. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job.","Yes it should be legal.

Why cannot a company advertise their product as better than another competitor's product as better than theirs:,"What does that mean?

Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.

By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.

""Deportation breaks up families""

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. 

"" Texas was Mexico's""

Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house. Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.

I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!

I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.

But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.

Why are insurance companies allowed to profile but law enforcement isnt?:,"Dear Friend,

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.

I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. 

Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.

Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages.

Anyway, back to the subject at home. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.

"Abortion   stance: no, should be illegal:","As a Catholic i have to say that it should be illegal. Because it is against my religion to kill innocent babies. In the Catholic church once the egg is fertilized it is considered a baby. So i think killing a baby and it not having a choice should be illegal and you should go to jail.
From other religions it might be against your religion.
but i still believe that it should be illegal.
If you know you can't support your baby you should put it up for adoption.
I also think that the government should be putting more money into adoption agencies and less into seniors.
I know that seniors have been alive and been important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future.
If someone was raped or it was incest they should still have the baby, i mean it is still a live and it still a baby.

Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.
The news makes us distrust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with.
We have people screaming at salesmen- why? Because we don't see them as the same as us. What makes a telemarketer so evil but the high pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone.
We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live.
It's not video games, it's televison programming and society that cause this.

We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated immediately. The place filled up over the next 15-20 minutes but our server remained efficient, competent and helpful. 
We ordered the 2-for-$35 bbq platter and it was awesome!  Ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, a hot link and an assortment of sides.  The tri tip, ribs and chicken were excellent and I never even got around to the pulled pork.  Honestly, better bbq than any place we have back home.
Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.
All in all, I was more than pleased by both the food and the atmosphere.","I was more than pleased by both the food and the atmosphere.

business name: gordon ramsay hell's kitchen. city: las vegas. categories: american (new), restaurants, breakfast & brunch, burgers:","Met all our expectations! 

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","Very good, exceeded our expectations!

business name: tim hortons. city: montréal. categories: restaurants, food, fast food:","I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things.  We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.  I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.

Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds.  Because that we had to throw it out.  We were  already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.","I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things.

Is it reasonable to let criminals vote while they are incarcerated? y or y not??:,"When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are repeat offenders.","When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)?

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","I disagree.

Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.","Debates are based on evidence.

I've visited this location four times since it opened, and even at the height of the ""NEW FOOD! EVERYBODY EAT THERE!"" commotion, the staff was unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the box in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick.

Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up.  This reflects the US' ""war on crime"" and ""war on drugs"" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly).  It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analize these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for african-americans is even worse - something like 6000+ african-american inmates per 100,000.","I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics.

Legal advice about payable on death issue?:,"Dear Friend,

Do not let them do this.  A person listed as ""payable on death"" has ZERO interest in your account while you are still alive.  They just get any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive.  Let them know you'll get a lawyer if they don't change their tune -- and that it'll cost them a LOT more than $800.  Bank stealing money from innocent children?  Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Wow, that's tough.

2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your backs to them.  You have the right to do this from the 1st amendment, just like they do.

3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia.  Support the same causes yourself.

I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other things that require lots of people and money.

At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, if this is incorrect I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.

"Cmv: i have no ethical issue with so called ""anti homeless spikes"":","Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.","Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes.

I'm only 19 and i've never been to Guantanamo so i don't know the exact happenigns of the place. I've never been in the Armed Forces or personally delt with the terrorists so this opinion of mine isn't based off of much.

"Is ""islamophobia"" justifiable?   stance: yes, it i justified:","I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures.
For instance:
""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....."" Surah 9:5
or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)
And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.
Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.","I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures.

Do you think britain should compensate the nations it colonised?:,"Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. Despite  the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zelanad is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone in international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today","Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people.

"Since liberalism=liberty and a liberal must be for freedom,what does a conservative or moderate person equal?:","Liberals (Democrats) as they're called in the States are actually not followers of traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy.

Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both.

Why aren't we held responsible for our reaction time when operating a motor vehicle?:,"It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.

Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcholol and other intoxicant. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.

So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.","It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.

I feel that a person like me isn't really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.

Cmv   the lion king is hugely overrated:,"There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was lion king.

Even if you hadn't seen or heard of Kimba the White Lion, the Lion King was so predictable as to be cliche. The characters and songs weren't anything more special than any other Disney movie either. 

I believe that the people who prosthelytize about the movie are mostly the ones who watched is as kids or young adults looking through nostalgia colored glasses. People who's first exposure to a real and dramatic story was Lion King so they came to believe that Lion King did something unique or special (when it really, really didn't).","There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin.

I understand that the main dissenting opinion is the idea that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots?

Don't bother consulting a lawyer on this one.  It would cost you too much.  This is exactly what small claims is designed for -- someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved.

Sue.  On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief.  Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name.  Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you.

Vaccines are not natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are unnatural and yet they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic.","I am a heterosexual male, and I can find no reason for condemning it as immoral.

Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.

Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.

Today, I don't hear our leaders in business, media, or heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism.

RED.
I'm guessing you said excite.

Yellow just reminds me of the sun or something.. which makes me happy.
But red comes to me as much more striking to look at and possibly, exciting.
It is also the colour for fire trucks and letter boxes and.. and.. red lipstick and.. rosy cheeks.. and.. and -- COOOOOOOOOOKE! :D","Caught this forum early, whoot - another colour forum.

Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious. 

This was an A+ experience. Very happy.","I had a really great dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off so it was vegan. SO. GOOD.

The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.

For the guys? if you were in this situation would you do the same?:,"I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.

Kids own a wardrobe of electronic gadgets too.  They are desensitized to content like death and sex at an earlier age.

If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or the other.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent.

So we really have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but it philosophically makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn. You dont have to believe in rebirth but there is no scientific basis for either external or internal consciousness and no scientific basis for the belief that death is just a black abyss.","Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.

Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.","No. The suicide (particularly of young people) is not only a drain on the country (education and the like) but also means the loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society.

What would happen!   stance: your brain would not explode if you saw a different color outerspace:,"We see different colours all the time. Most of them are shades of other colours. For instance, the Rebecca Black Friday music video. When she is singing about how to-day is Friday, there is a weird and very exotic colour that appears on the screen.

Are we heading towards a global recession?   stance: yes:,"(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres.
(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.

"Remove ""in god we trust"" from currency, courts & other governmental institutions?   stance: no, it a motto we all should live by:","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
Your assertion is complex and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants, and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America.
For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without the stupid motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.
As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do with our money.
The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist. I think the motto should stand--even though many atheists may be irritated by it. The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.","You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money?

Religion and proof   stance: religious people should provide proof for their beliefs if they promote it as truth:,"If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim.

Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:,"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.","Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
