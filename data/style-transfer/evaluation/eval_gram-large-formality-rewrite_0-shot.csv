I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon.

I know MJ isn't an isolated case and it seems to be the rule for people who die young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart.

There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of wal-mart.

The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. Eye witness accounts claim that he did.

In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate himself was sorrowful and did not sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. In that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.

"Do dogs have the capacity to remember   stance: dogs have the capacity for remembering people, places and objects:","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning.
Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.","The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity.

Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing.

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.

The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.","The Cheesecake Factory is a big box food store.

"If prostitution is illegal, how can it be legal to pay two people to have sex and film it in a porn movie?:","The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises not Lions and Bats.

The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts are hard to see. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with.

The bottom line is they could make prostitution legal, they chose not to, they could make porn illegal they chose not to. It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says is the difference. Great question.","The difference between the two is that one is legal and the other is not.

Pornography:
""Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.""

Explicit:
""Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion""

I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was ""pornographic"" when the text is not sexy or titilating - just descriptive [sexually explicit if you will]. Some dont even include real descriptions of sex at all...

2.)  Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminates of mercury in some batches of HFCS
3.) HFCS and cane sugar are NOT biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way
4.) The corn industry is VERY corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy

I believe that HFCS should not be used by major companies such as coca cola and Pepsi.

Someone says something and another person says ""that's racist,"" which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's entire argument.

Let's please ignore inflammatory racist statements. We all know they are bad.

This ""that's racist"" trump card is played virtually any time race is a component of the discussion. 

A recent example is the Mark Cuban situation (let's please not debate that ITT). If you're unaware, Mark Cuban speaking of the Donald Sterling NBA fiasco said that if a black male in a hoodie is walking down the street he would switch to the other side, and if that ~~said~~ side had a white male with neck tattoos he would switch back.

Bleach vs fullmetal alchemist   stance: fullmetal alchemist:,"They aren't really on the same level.
Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.
FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.
Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.
The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.","The quality of the anime is not as good as that of the manga.

It's the best Mexican food I've had in such a very long time. It's family owned, and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients is so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata. My go to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or their Chicken Chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. I could eat here everyday.

We asked for chips and salsa she said they only have nachos.  We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us.  So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was ""it's not on the menu"".

Cmv: higher insurance rates for young men is sexist.:,"Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. 

For example, ""Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population."" Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.

First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality.

Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

Cmv: star wars episodes i iii are better than iv vi:,"Just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were just more enjoyable.  

The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV.  

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.

Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.

I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar).

The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.

What are the shorcomings of any public opinion poll?:,"The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.  The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has a bias as well.  The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do.
The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.

What rights does the employer have when an employer claim an unfair dismissal?:,"Do you mean ""employee""? And what's ""unfair dismissal""? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn'tmean you have an action against them for firing you.

However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.  

SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a ""Contigency"" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case.  Contact your local bar association for a reference.","In most states, employment is at-will, meaning an employer can dismiss an employee for any reason or no reason at all.

"Cmv: road kill doesn't matter, a netural response to seeing an animal being killed is fine:","Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it.

In both forms the people vote for the person/persons they want to ""rule"" them, the people choose those who agree with them, the only difference is the different countries' way to do it.
For an example:
Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc.
USA chooses 1 president....BUT STILL: The people CHOOSE, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose ""the chosen ones"".","The answer is no, but there are several times ""no"" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic.

How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:,"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.","Many abortionists do not view the issue as black and white, but each person has their own morals and conscience.

1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours feed them.

2. If you want to curb obesity, 

3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.

As a person who just graduated highschool last year in the USA, the school lunches were expensive ($3) and crap, i knew many children whose lunch would consist of chips, candy, and soda, and refused to buy lunch either because they didn't' want to spend the money, or because the lunch was poor in quality.

While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance.  Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World.  It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.  

Shortly after recovering the Cross,  Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan.  He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection.  So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing.  Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum.  CMV.

The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting.

Cmv: head to head results should be a higher world cup group play tiebreaker than goals scored.:,"First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).

EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.","I believe that the first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference.

Cmv: i think that outsourcing to china isn't all that bad:,"The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed. ","I do not agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, but it is the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have.

There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:

2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.

Isn't entrapment by trying to get clerks or waitresses to sell alcohol to a minor illegal?:,"First, my expertise.  I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation.

It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol.  It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him.  The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.  If the decoy just says to the clerk, ""Oh, come on!"" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.","I am a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that defended liquor licenses.

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more ""diverse"".

Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap.

Cmv: overinclusiveness is fundamentally necessary (although not sufficient) for creativity.:,"When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them (one should keep them in mind and only qualify them to varying degrees). Entirely rejecting ideas or the weaker associations between different ideas, while seemingly pragmatic, only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively.

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","We had a wonderful time here. Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington was a great choice.

We went for breakfast before our train back to the States.  I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.

Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds.  Because that we had to throw it out.  We were  already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.","We went to Tim Horton's for breakfast and had heard good things.

So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.","The U.S. cannot afford not to be friendly to China, a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.

The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:,"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.","I disagree.

Cmv: the us' obsession with 'parity' in sports is misguided.:,"When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.

I don't see why anybody cares.
The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win.

Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other.

People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport.
True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team.

Evolution vs. creation   stance: evolution:,"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.","Debates are based on convincing evidence. However, there is very little evidence supporting creationism, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.

"Pledge of allegiance: forcing religion?   stance: do you think that saying ""under god"" is too religious for america?:","Yes....I feel it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period.
School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere.

To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.

The more information you have about your daughters dad the better i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.","You have the right to ask for sole custody if you feel he is doing more damage than good by being involved in her life. This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order in place as far as visitation. My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time.

Petitions?:,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. 

However, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. 

So the answer to your question is yes.

Hope this helped somewhat.","I am not sure I understand the question. However, petitions are legal.

Is it aganst gods law to look at naked woman on the internet?:,"No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.

So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.","No, looking at a naked woman is not against God's law.

How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:,"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.","Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

Cmv: america spends too much on special education:,"I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom.

My view at the moment is that if they vote for independence they should get complete independence.  A full and immediate cease of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to join if they wanted to), the immediate withdrawal of the NHS and other services such as British police/fire services and armed forces.

"Cmv: i have no ethical issue with so called ""anti homeless spikes"":","Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.","I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called ""anti-homeless"" spikes.

"Is ""islamophobia"" justifiable?   stance: yes, it i justified:","I believe it can be justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures.
For instance:
""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....."" Surah 9:5
or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)
And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.
Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.","I believe it is justified to be afraid of one of the only major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in its scriptures.

Cmv: affirmative action policies encourage the prejudice they seek to prevent.:,"Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background.

I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill ""race quotas"" to ""diversify the campus"" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one. 

The intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning, aimed at helping needy students. However, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color. ","The purpose of Affirmative Action is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background.

business name: chi ko roo. city: toronto. categories: food, breakfast & brunch, american (traditional), restaurants:","It was just ok for me, at best.  The menu is large but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like.  My friend had a burger and fries and I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries.  You get a salad first - I had caesar and my friend had garden.  The caesar salad was the highlight of my meal!  It was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicy.  My friend seemed to like the garden salad ok but it looked pretty basic to me - mostly lettuce.

My friend enjoyed his burger and I have to say it did look like a good burger.  My sandwich came out cold, which is not a good start to a toasted sandwich.  It might have been pretty good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland.  The sweet potato fries were good, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs.  

It's true - the portion sizes are huge.  But I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.","I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries. The menu is large but it seems to be very chain restaurant-like.

He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes.

"Is it wrong to have sexual intercourse with those below the age of consent (uk age 16)   stance: no, it is morally and physically wrong:","This argument is very close to me at the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally ""developed"" yet.
He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is:
a. Breaking the law.
b. Aware he is breaking the law
c. Proud of it.
Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's and even permanent damage to their bodies.
I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong.
I'm not one that support no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is, is a different story.","I am not one who supports no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is.

This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the ""ultimate sagging mattress"" that is often alluded to.
Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions.
2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes.
3. It can never work with quantum physics.
4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum?

Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:,"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

I hope this helps.","I do not know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but my personal opinion is that historically, when human rights were defined, women were not included.

Some obese people do not eat much, but what they are eating is junk and empty calories. Some try to buy healthy and get things like Slim Fast full of preservatives and poisons. Some just do not exercise. Maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise or health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk and make organic and natural foods more affordable.

Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

business name: outback steakhouse. city: huntersville. categories: steakhouses, nightlife, bars, restaurants:","Went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there however, none came to even take our drink order for 15 minutes so we left. Manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant. Mind boggling!","I went in on a Monday night and there were several servers there but none came to take our drink order for 15 minutes so we left.

business name: claim jumper restaurant & saloon. city: henderson. categories: steakhouses, restaurants, barbeque, nightlife, american (traditional), seafood, bars:","Food was actually amazing and our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!!!","The food was amazing and our server Samantha was very nice.

business name: chanpen thai cuisine. city: phoenix. categories: restaurants, thai:","Probably the best and most authentic Thai food I've had in Arizona. (Tried 2 curries and pad Thai) But that's not why I gave this place 5 stars. After my girlfriend ordered her curry a little too spicy for her taste (and ate a good amount), we asked the waiter if he could lessen the spice and he left to the kitchen only to return with a brand new curry (and rice) cooked with less spice. 

Oh and we got free ice cream! How cool is that!?!","I tried two curries and pad Thai and I must say that this place is the best and most authentic Thai food I have had in Arizona.

business name: boomtown pub & patio. city: calgary. categories: nightlife, pubs, restaurants, tapas bars, gastropubs, bars:","Just really not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff.  It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.","I had a group of 12 people and it was not a good experience.

business name: paramount middle eastern kitchen. city: toronto. categories: middle eastern, restaurants, halal, breakfast & brunch:","I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. 

I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.

I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.","I was very disappointed in the food portions for the price point.
