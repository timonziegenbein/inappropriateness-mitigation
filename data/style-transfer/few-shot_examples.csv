Emotional Deception,"The emotions appealed to are used as deceptive tricks to win, derail, or end the discussion.",Can the police keep your car permantly if you have 3rd suspended license?:,"Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time? Man, you're just not getting the message, are you? If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef. Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive. People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan. Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6...and a link to it below. It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. You really need to stop driving. Really.","If you are towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time, I would advise you to reconsider your behavior. In California, the police can impound your vehicle even with fewer than three tows. Technically, your vehicle could be impounded after just the first license suspension. Cases like this are exactly why the legislature created the law because you have been stripped of the privilege to drive a vehicle, yet you continue to drive. Such behavior leads to an exponentially higher-than-average number of road accidents, which is why the legislature decided to hand over the vehicles in question to the state when people do not play by the rules. Below is a link to California Vehicle Code section 14607.6. I suggest you look at 14607.4 even if you don't live in California; and seriously ask you to stop driving.","If you are in California, the police can forfeit your vehicle after fewer than three incidents. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license. The legislature designed that law with people in mind that don't take suspended licenses seriously and continue to drive anyway. Such people tend to be involved in an exponentially higher-than-average number of traffic accidents, so the legislature figured that they should have their vehicles taken into custody if they don't take the suspension seriously. Voila - I give you California Vehicle Code section 14607.6 and a link to it below. You might also want to take time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. After three suspensions, you should consider stopping driving.","Your vehicle has been towed and impounded three times for 30 days each time. If you are in California, the police can forfeit your vehicle after your first suspended license offense. This law was designed to prevent accidents caused by drivers who continue to drive despite their license being suspended. You can find more information about this law in California Vehicle Code sections 14607.6 and 14607.4. Please make sure to review these sections whether or not you live in California.","Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time? I think you misunderstood the message. You are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle, and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef. In my opinion, situations like this are exactly the reason the legislature designed that law because one's privilege to drive has been taken away, and yet they continue to drive. People were involved in an exponentially higher-than-average number of traffic accidents, so the legislature figured maybe they should have their vehicles forfeited to the state if they did not abide by the law. By the California Vehicle Code section 14607.6 (link to it below). It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California.","It appears that your vehicle has been towed and impounded for 30 days on three occasions. I think you don't understand the reason they are doing this. If you are in California, the police can legally seize your vehicle and initiate forfeiture proceedings after the first license suspension. This law was designed to address individuals who continue to drive despite having their driving privileges revoked, as they are statistically more likely to be involved in traffic accidents. By seizing your vehicle, you are no longer able to drive, and consequently, you don't jeopardize other people's lives. I would like to direct your attention to California Vehicle Code section 14607.6. Additionally, it may be helpful to review section 14607.4, regardless of your location. Please take this matter seriously and comply with the laws and regulations."
Excessive Intensity,The emotions appealed to by an argument are unnecessarily strong for the discussed issue.,If given the choice what way would you vote for the death penalty to be brought back in britain?:,Yes i am completely for it. People are arguing that it is barbaric and inhumane but who can stand up and say that some perv who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in britain at the moment is hopeless. Far to many people are gettin away with all sorts and something needs to be done!!,"Yes, I am completely for it. People argue that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that someone who raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to life. We would put down a dangerous dog; why shouldn't we do the same to the dangerous criminals living in our country? The current justice system in Britain needs to be changed since too many people are getting away with all sorts of things.","Yes, I am for it. People argue that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that a person conducting child abuse still has the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog; why not act in a similar way with criminals living in our country? I don't think very highly of the justice system in Britain at the moment. Far too many people are getting away with all sorts of things, and something needs to be done!!","People argue that capital punishment is barbaric and inhumane. However, some believe that people who have committed heinous crimes such as rape and murder of children should not have human rights and the right to live. While we put down dangerous dogs, some believe that we should do the same to criminals who commit such crimes. The justice system in Britain has been criticized for being too lenient on criminals. It is important to ensure that justice is served.","Yes, I am in agreement with it. People are arguing that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that some perv who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would take measures against any danger; why not do the same to some of the offenders that live in our country? The justice system in Britain at the moment is not the best. It has room for improvement.","Yes, I'm completely for it. People argue it's barbaric and inhumane, but who can defend the argument that a depraved person who raped and killed a child still has human rights and a right to live. We put down a dog that exhibits dangerous behavior; why we shouldn't do it to a depraved person? The British justice system is not performing well enough at the moment. Many people are not paying the price of their actions, so something should be done to prevent this."
Missing Seriousness,The argument is either trolling others by suggesting (explicitly or implicitly) that the issue is not worthy of being discussed or does not contribute meaningfully to the discussion.,Is porn wrong:,"Porn is Wrong. mainly because they are Not Doing it Right. it should be Hi Def. in three years, it will be in 3-D.",-,-,Porn is wrong because it is not professional enough. The videos should have high definition.,Porn can be harmful. Mainly because they can be elusive.,"Porn is wrong because they are not doing it right. But jokes aside, it should be in higher resolution. In three years, it will be in 3D."
Missing Openness,The argument displays an unwillingness to consider arguments with opposing viewpoints and does not assessthe arguments on their merits but simply rejects them out of hand.,Pro choice vs pro life:,There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?,"Regardless of how you see a fetus, it is still a living being created in a very intimate way. You should not change what Mother Nature, God or fate, or you name it, has decided for you. Incidentally, if you didn't want to get pregnant in the first place, you shouldn't have sex or protect yourself. Yes, there are some women who are raped, and that is very unfortunate, but they should give birth and give it up for adoption. It is not the child's fault that it was made. I do not see a reason why the created being should have to pay the ultimate price for its life.","In point of view, whatever way you see a fetus... it's still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wanna get preggo in the first place... don't have sex or use protection. I see the issue that there there are some women that get raped, and it's very unfortunate, but I think they should give the child up for adoption in such cases. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?",Some believe that a fetus is a living form that should not be terminated. Others believe that women should have the right to choose what happens to their bodies.,"In my opinion, a fetus is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... one shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate has decided for them...and if they didn't wanna get pregnant in the first place then maybe they should consider not having sex or using protection. Also, I think there are some women that get raped, and it's very unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?","There should be no argument for this. A fetus is a living form that has been created by some means. If you didn't want to get pregnant, you should have avoided sex or use protection. I know that there are women who got raped and consequently pregnant. Although it's unfortunate, they still shouldn't abort the baby, and they should let other people adopt the baby. It's not the child's fault that it was created, so why should it pay the ultimate price for your decisions?"
Unclear Meaning,"The argument’s content is vague, ambiguous, or implicit, such that  it remains unclear what is being said about the issue (it could also be an unrelated issue).",Evolution vs creation:,"Believing ""Evolution"" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together.","Believing in ""Evolution,"" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together. The complexity of the evolution cannot be simplified by just looking at a couple of pieces that seem to fit together.","Believing in ""Evolution,"" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together. The probability of such things happening tends to be very low; thus, the ""evolution"" theory seems to be very unlikely, in my opinion.",-,"Believing in ""Evolution,"" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing in something that happened because of coincidence.","Believing in evolution, as in Darwinism and other similar theories, is like believing that if two pieces of a puzzle fit together after randomly scattering the puzzle pieces on the table, then we can achieve the final solution of the puzzle without really solving it."
Missing Relevance,"The argument does not discuss the issue, but derails the discussion implicitly towards a related issue or shifts completely towards a different issue.",Is it illegal to record a phone conversation?:,The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.,The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to achieve by recording the conversation except that she wanted to create even more drama. Some people like drama and try to create it. I would suggest that you do not surround yourself with such people because they only cost you energy.,"In the context of law, recording a phone conversation is illegal and can thus not be used as evidence in a court of law.",It's important to understand the laws in your state regarding recording phone conversations.,It is unclear if a conversation can be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation. One should look more into the laws to gain a proper insight into the matter.,"Since a recorded conversation can't be used as evidence in court, then it's pointless to record it. Some people like this woman want to create drama from everything. This kind of people should be avoided because they are abusive."
Confusing Reasoning,The argument’s components (claims and premises) seem not to be connected logically.,If your spouse committed murder and he or she confided in you would you turn them in:,i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.,"I am undecided whether I would turn in my wife. On the one hand, I would turn my wife in because it is wrong to kill someone, even if it was an accident, and because the police will find out who killed that person. On the other hand, I wouldn't turn her in because I don't want her to leave me for a long time.","On the one hand, I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person. On the other hand, I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time, so I'm a bit torn in this regard.","It's important to do the right thing and report a crime if you know someone has committed it. While it may be difficult to turn in someone you care about, it is important to consider the consequences of not reporting a crime.","I would turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person.","I would turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it's still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person. However, I don't want her to be in prison for a long time; as a result, I'm facing a dilemma. The wrongness of the act makes me turn her in, but she's my wife, and although I want her to be punished for the act, I don't want her to spend a long time in prison, so for this reason, I don't want to turn her in."
Detrimental Orthography,"The argument has serious spelling and/or grammatical errors, negatively affecting its readability.",Is the school uniform a good or bad idea:,it dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it,School uniforms prevent children from showing their personalities.,It does not show the expression of kids and uniforms,"School uniforms prohibit kids from expressing themselves through fashion, which makes school uniforms a bad idea.",It does not show the kid's expressions as it is.,"School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are"
Reason Unclassified,There are reasons other than those mentioned above why the argument should be considered inappropriate,Firefox vs internet explorer:,"Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reason why i prefer Firefox","I prefer Firefox due to its extensions, such as Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab.","Firefox has many great tools and plugins, such as Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com).

Toxic Emotions,An argument has toxic emotions if the emotions appealed to are deceptive or their intensities do not provide room for critical evaluation of the issue by the reader.,Should bush adminstration officials be prosecuted for war crimes? stance: yes:,"Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world turned against Germany. In fact, there are dozens if cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations and the world has caused uproar and rose up against it. Yet some dumb Texan does it and gets away with it.

In fact, there have been dozens of cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations, and the world has caused uproar and rose up against it. In the same way, George W.

In fact, there have been dozens of these cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations, and the world was in an uproar and rose up against these invasions. Yet when a US president does this, he gets away with it. I think the same should apply to people such as Bush and Tony Blair; they both should be sentenced to death or imprisonment for war crimes. They are no exception."
Missing Commitment,An argument is missing commitment if the issue is not taken seriously or openness other’s arguments is absent.,Pro choice vs pro life:,There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection.

Missing Intelligibility,An argument is not intelligible if its meaning is unclear or irrelevant to the issue or if its reasoning is not understandable.,Ban plastic water bottles,We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession!,"We will be able to ban water bottles once we get out of this recession! Until then, we are in need of sales in order to stabilize the economy.","Due to the current recession, the production of oil, and with that, oil-based products, is limited. Plastic water bottles are thus getting more expensive to produce. During this time, I think that water companies will be okay with not using the usually cheaper plastic bottles. After the recession ends, however, I don't think we will be able to continue to forbid the use of the, then probably again, cheaper plastic bottles.",Banning water bottles is a costly or unpopular policy that can only be implemented when the economy is doing well.,-,"Recession causes people to go for cheaper and more convenient options, such as buying water in plastic bottles. If we resolve this issue, then we can ban plastic bottles too. We first should improve the current economic situation, which is the priority. Then we can take care of environmental issues."
Other Reasons,An argument is inappropriate if it contains severe orthographic errors or for reasons not covered by any other dimension.,Tv is better than books,tv because only tv can bring u live news at books u can't find also it's educational,"TV, because it's educational and can bring you live news that you can't find in books.","TV is better than books because it is able to deliver live news, an experience you just cannot have with books.

Inappropriateness,"An argument has an appropriate style if the used language supports the creation of credibility and emotions as well as if it is proportional to the issue. The choice of words and the grammatical complexity should appear suitable for the topic discussed within the given setting, matching the way credibility and emotions are created.","How do you thonk about the world,s future?","Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right, I hate any form of marxism. I believe a man should be judge by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish","I would describe myself as a far-right fair-trade capitalist who dislikes any form of Marxism. I believe that a person should be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. I believe that the solution to the world's problems can be found in the Bible. I believe that public education is largely ineffective due to a lack of literacy and a basic understanding of economics. Based on this belief system, I believe that one day the world will end due to the laws of nature, namely entropy. This is the natural tendency of systems to move from a state of order to a state of disorder over time. Nothing will change: the hatred of Israel and Christianity will continue to grow, and we will always have wars because of the basic selfishness of people.","I identify myself as a fair trade capitalist and extreme right. I strongly dislike any form of Marxism. I believe that a man should be judged by who he is, not his outer appearance, because I think the latter creates many problems. Because I see a lot of people doing the latter, though, I'm not very optimistic about the future. However, I believe that the solution for most of the problems of this world can be found in the bible. Another issue I perceive for the future is the low rate of literacy and missing content about basic economics in the current curriculum of public education. I thus think it's a waste of money that could be invested to solve or prevent other problems in the world. Having the mentioned issues as a basis, I think that the world will end one day. I am, however, not worried about it because, next to God, I also believe in the basic laws of nature, most importantly entropy. Another pessimistic thought is that the hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. This might cause further wars in the future, as they will try to defend themselves from attacks.\r\n\r\nSadly, I think there is nothing that will change this, as humans are basically selfish, which is the main cause of wars. Lastly, I don't believe in climate change, but I agree that storms will continue to be bad. However, we have always had storms and always will. Climate change will not change this.","I advocate for fair trade and free markets. I strongly reject any form of Marxism. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public education, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.","Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right; I dislike any form of Marxism. I believe a man should be judged by who he is, not his hide. I believe that the solution to the problems of this world is found in the bible. Public education can be reformed due to the literacy rate and little understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. A change seems difficult since we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars because, in my opinion, man is basically selfish.","As an extreme right-wing thinker, I believe that the future of the world should be based on a fair trade form of capitalism. I am strongly against any form of Marxism, and I believe that a person should be judged based on who they are rather than what they hide. In my view, the solution to the current problems of the world can be found in the Bible. However, I do not believe that public education is a worthwhile investment, as it only increases literacy rates and does not improve people's understanding of economics. I also think that the world will ultimately end someday, as this is a natural law whereby a system moves towards reducing its entropy, which is the current problem of the world. In the future, I anticipate that the hatred towards Israel and Christianity will continue to grow and that we will continue to face problems similar to the ones we face now. Wars persist because humans are essentially selfish."
