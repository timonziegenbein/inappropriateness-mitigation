I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.

Issue:
Business Review: 1.0 stars for Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, under the categories of resorts, arts & entertainment, restaurants, hotels, hotels & travel, event planning & services, and casinos.

Argument:
The exorbitant valet fees of $16 for the first 2 hours are truly concerning. The hotel's justification that patrons are using parking for airport purposes appears dubious. Furthermore, they claim to share this fee with the valet, eliminating the need for tipping. This practice is disheartening, particularly given the negative publicity this establishment has received. It's worth noting that The Venetian, a neighboring competitor, does not charge for valet services. This practice reflects poorly on Mandalay Bay, and one can't help but wonder if it's indicative of a wider trend within the MGM corporation. It's worth mentioning that parking at the shopping center valet at Mandalay is a free alternative, although it may seem trivial to complain about this matter. Unfortunately, it underscores the broader issue of how casinos often seem to overcharge for various services, leading to a flood of patrons seeking free parking at the mall.",

Argument:
The argument presented here is highly inappropriate for a debate. It lacks the necessary decorum and appropriateness for several reasons:

Emotional Appeal: The argument uses derogatory language, such as ""liberal ignorance,"" which appeals to negative emotions and does not provide room for critical evaluation. It also implies that ""liberals"" are solely responsible for this viewpoint.

Lack of Openness: The argument is dismissive of opposing viewpoints, stating that gun control is just ""feel-good"" legislation without considering other perspectives or potential benefits.

Clarity and Relevance: The argument lacks clarity and relevance as it veers off-topic by discussing hunting rights and government control, which are not directly related to the issue of gun control.

Inflammatory Language: The use of terms like ""letting the criminals run rampant"" and the comparison of hunting rifles to machine guns adds to the inflammatory tone of the argument.

A more appropriate argument for a debate would maintain a respectful tone, focus on the core issue of gun control, present clear and relevant reasoning, and be open to considering opposing viewpoints.",

It is difficult to judge whether porn is a sin, as the Bible does not mention porn namely as a sin. Therefore I do not think it is possible to know if porn is right or wrong, by judging the Bible and its teachings alone, so it may be valuable to explore other resources on what can be considered moral or not.",

In order to purchase a hand gun, you first need to take time off work to take a state mandated firearms safety course, then once this is passed, you must also pass a criminal background and FBI check. If you pass these checks also, you can submit an application for a hand gun purchase. If this has been granted, you can make your purchase, following a mandatory three day waiting period. I am also aware that some states, such as New York, have even stricter controls, which in turn increases crime, as the majority of people trying to access guns are not prepared to go through the lengthy process required. If there was a national standard on gun law, then honest people could better exercise their constitutional rights and access a gun, so they are better prepared against criminals.",I think the commenter wanted looser laws but it was quite difficult to understand exactly what their argument was but I think it is the above.

How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.\r\nAnd concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.', 'post_issue': 'Should capital punishment be allowed?:', 'post_rewrite_a': 'nan', 'post_rewrite_b': 'nan'}",Should capital punishment be allowed?:,"I believe that capital punishment should be allowed in select cases where the criminal committed very serious acts (such as rape, torture and murder) and there is absolutely no doubt that they are innocent. Unfortunately there are many instances where our judicial system allows the charging of innocent people, and as a result some innocent people had been put to death, and later it was found that they were not guilty after all. In order for a system involving capital punishment to work, this must be prevented from ever happening, as we have a commitment to protect the innocent. However, I do not believe that it is fair to allow a criminal who has taken the lives of innocents, to be allowed to live off taxpayer money in relative comfort. ",
220,5,78,In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure.
