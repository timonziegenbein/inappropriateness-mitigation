111	 creationism is not the only thinking about the origin of this highly complex body. People can think about the formation of this body in various ways, including evolution. Sure, some people want to see our brains crafted by design. Others believe that we evolved from monkeys. Still others believe that we evolve into and live within a universe. There is no ONE right answer on this, since we are not physics experimenters
112	 It is my belief that for the whole world, we need to have a healthier understanding of how the creation and the processes of the body works. Our senses can take over but it does not take away from the fact that Science needs to be more available to the general public.
113	Be open to other views, and listen to what people are trying to say. Try to understand that science, for the most part, explains the past and does not have an answer for all things. Practice really good hygiene.
114	The body, every tiny cell, has its own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances?

135	 Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore.

137	To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when Charles Darwin went off to Europe, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Charles Darwin more than Raffles, and to them, Charles Darwin was a more competent leader.
138	 Farquhar was sent off as a comminicant. Raffles left Singapore as a commander, while Farquhar left it as a commander/leader. Raffles had the job to lead Singapore into independence, while Farquhar was sent to Britain because the British needed him to lead them into independence.
139	Leader - The group, organisation or political party to which a person is the leader, having power or authority over it.  Both Raffles and Farquhar were leaders of organisations. Raffles was a leader for a short time, he left Singapore for the first time and his successor was Ernest de Raffles. In another situation, a leader could be a military commander, politician, religious leader, business leader, or anybody who is currently in charge of a group of people.  Farquhar was not only a leader, but he was also very competent.  Leader - A person who is the leader of a group of people.

152	 Life is a ceaseless expansion of the rest of the body. Best case scenario, evolution on Earth is as follows: actual - fantasy - perception - brain - entertainment - disease - impairment - death.

158	I believe creationists feel the evolution was fabricated. Ask them to look into the scientific proofs.  On the other hand, you should research why I believe evolution is correct, so that you can a have a better understanding of this topic. My point is that scientists believe in evolution so they can find the path for creationists to disprove their absurdity.

162	Gosh it sounds like your so mad at this that you cant think logically. it could be worse Mmm ... monkeys might think of their own speech .. haha yawn no monkeys have evolved into humans yet ..
163	 monkeys don't evolved to speak. although on the other hand they do speak, but not aloud. So yes if we are descendants from monkeys we have evolved and what monkeys evolved from originally is incapable of. because this development has occured a long time ago.
164	Yo solo me rio We'd be born as monkeys; we won't ever evolve to talk unless humans do. We would never talk for monkeys, as we evolved from the very human organisms that are capable of speech.

166	Illegal porn is bad for the society. Porn is a form of art for artists!
167	Yes There Really Is No Answer to this question because we know everything about Porn. Porn is good but when it's not being used right in relation to a partner it will be considered illegal. Yes
168	You can call it "Porn", not to be offensive. but I don't agree that there should be any wrong in possessing it. Porn is wrong for people that do have a partner.
169	Illegal Porn is bad for you. If it is not really wrong, then Porn should be "legal". Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who are single.   :)
170	Porn isn't inherently wrong because it's simple as that.It's also such a productive art form.
171	We don't want to pressure people to feel pressure or control how they do things and therefore we shouldn't overly moderate the pornography we host for it to ensure that nobody's privacy is compromised.
172	It's easy to play with the porn because there's no stats or background information.
173	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It really can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.
174	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It really can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.And there's a reason it gets given such clear legal rights and support from not only society but also the government.

187	That being said there is a global powerhouse that can be the Ultimate Champ. That can be half the United States or maybe even twice the United States and it is more than an individual entity. And that's the power of democracy.
188	 The humble method. Letting everybody else show their achievements while sharing the same ideals and knowing your weaknesses gives you the best chances for success.  You are always true to your principles. You only work and strive for what is really good for you and your people. This is the way of the champ.
189	 There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.

195	Although I personally think it is better to pursue personal wealth and income rather than common good, what I say is not based on personal interests but rather based on an objective opinion.  cleaner
196	I like common good over personal pursuit because its better to help people when in our lives.
197	 personal_pursuit is better than common good because common good is just a thought whereas it makes sense to help people only if it truly requires it.
198	I believe personal pursuit is better because it make me feel needed and wanted by my friends and family.  Luang Prabang, Beniamnio
199	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.

204	I know that there is nothing that a person should do about his religion and his race.  People are responsible for themselves.  ### For this child - it is good to know that everyone accepts each other.

220	 Well, I agree that having a father is better than not having one at all, but I think that even those who want a father in their lives, sometimes they choose not to. I think that if you go too far without a father then you will lose your biggest asset in your life.
221	 If only I knew why you were uncomfortable talking to your father. I think I had a good father, but then things went wrong in my life. I wish you would have someone who knew you that would talk to you about things like this. But I can't say I would do anything differently. Not having a father is okay.
222	 To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a lousy father is very bad to have and he probaly wont do all the things that a good father would do, but at least yo have that assurance that you have someone that is a father in your life. I beileve that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. You have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.
223	 Nobody needs a father more than a father needs a son. I totally understand that. Now that I know that, I look at my dad instead of being mad at him for being such a lousy father and realize that for sure he would be the best. Honestly, why do I even think that he is a lousy father?
224	Years of age: 3 years old  In the future when you experience some changes in your life:   I hope, that someday u will change ur mind. No father will ever bring u love, happiness, stability, etc., but on the other hand, u dont know what would happen if u did have him.

226	Yes, a good father is the healthiest option for a child. A lousy father is better than no father. Two years ago she was a child herself and was a lousy father but she wishes she had a good one now.
227	Fatherless children should know that there are people who care for them and that they can count on them. There are people to care for them if they are Fatherless in any way.

Think about what's making the argument too long to solve the problem! how about doing something to protect yourself in case someone else does

234	People are able to change and make themselves better people. So I hope my father can change and be a good father. Note that you changed the "will never meet him" sentence to a more likely thought.

280	### Response: "I don't think the issue here is whether or not to admit gay relationships into the marriage construct, but rather how." This is a loaded question. It can be argued as I did above, but in a different context. Consider that from an anatomical perspective, homosexual relationships exist between males and not female and would thus be judged differently than heterosexual relationships. I left out that part of my rebuttal since it would have made my argument about marriage disruption much more profound.
281	FYI, the marriage between same sex people is called civil unions: civil unions exist outside marriage, because same sex couples have decided not to marry. I was simply making a point that laws should be blindly applied - even to a change less than 10% of the law is true. That was no kind of pat out statement, and you can rebuttal it using the same argument in my post about the answer to res0ndf7. There is a marriage between LGBT couples called civil unions.

Point 1 may seem vague, but point 2 becomes more clear to everyone and can be rephrased as follows:    2) a woman cannot legally sell her body for money in many states    Point 3 is not consistent with any other topics and can be rephrased as follows:    a woman cannot use her body to murder others or take her drugs or steal, or display her naked body in public.
328	 Yes, the government tells us what to do with our bodies all the time. This is not different from us telling them what we think. people think that a woman should be a virgin for her whole life before marriage and also killed her partner if he don‚Äôt agree to that idea. so also many other things about womens bodies. we think that the government should not exist
329	 The government REALLY does have a place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. The government DOES have that right. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public There are MANY more. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.

343	 Yeet, but is it my fault that it's my life? What do I know? If a woman is pregnant you shouldn't have sex with her. Have sex with her and be responsible. Us infants are defective so the world isn't safe. They should be put up for adoption. If a woman doesn't have sex then the baby could be defective... Put the baby up for adoption or if they refuse it get in a hospital and give birth. There should be a private choice if you are able.
344	Women should stop having sex during their most fertile times, and prevent pregnancy, if they can help it. That way some of the childless couples will be able to benefit from there messed up pregnancies - and we don't need to talk about the innocent mothers etc. - We should look more at the irresponsible people who have sex at any fertile times and end up getting pregnant

347	first, make a choice to not get pregnant than trying to stop it (if you can't, some better methods are there, rather than to take a chance, and be like pro-life takes the woman's position, having faith and hope, and then try to clobber women)

350	 Violence against women is a good reason to punish a child. However, violence against women does include being raped or having another person manipulate/force a woman into
351	I am against child abuse and violence. The woman should protect the child and he should have an agency that could give it up for adoption. my opinion about the arguments
352	 A woman doesn't want the child, is a better reason to stop a rape than killing the baby to preserve the baby's life.  Recommended Changes    ### Response:  A baby wants to be born, its too early for a baby to be killed.
353	 A woman who is raped might decide to have an abortion, She would be more likely to raise a baby. She might give the child up for adoption, but her decision depends on what she wants.
354	 When a baby is born it is not responsible for their parents actions. Imagine if someone raped you or your sibling, or if someone did something to you as an adult but you did nothing to stop them, then you would stop them if you could. Why would you not ask the baby for counseling? You are killing a baby because of someone else's mistakes
355	No fear gay marriage should be allowed. And you call me prejudice. Two men or two women who are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
356	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. There are exceptions, who do not want it to be allowed just hate homosexuals all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
357	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. To me, love should override prejudice and shouldn't something be interpreted as something it isnt only because someone is prejudiced towards it.
358	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
359	No I cannot accept that. No I can't support gay marriage. I am a traditional Christian, same sex couples do not belong together, gay people are found to be homosexual and not suitable for marriage.
360	Make:  The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.

365	You do not have the right to decide on someone else's lifestyle.   Change from 'Please fix this argument. What do you suggest I write in place of what you wrote?' to 'Please fix this argument. What do you suggest I write in place of what you wrote?
366	An example would be if someone is forced to wear a particular religious symbol, to wear it is not a choice.
367	You cannot tell anyone that there is no alternative choice.   If you decide not to use the toilet in a public restroom you are at a choice point for whether to become a retard (an art form).
368	You cannot make any changes in someone's lifestyle as that would change you. This is not a fact, it's a simplified version of what you have learned.
369	You cannot choose your own lifestyle when you don't agree with it. You cannot call your lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
370	Marriage should not be based on anything but love between two people and if both of those 2 people were gay then it seems wrong but the feelings and hiden is not viewed as negative or as a thing to be offensive, as was seen in the song mash up of hers.
371	I guess you‚Äôre right, just not what I wanted to be posting. and that‚Äôs probably not what I had in mind at all. I thought maybe it would be sort of a place to reflect on my feelings about stuff, but I guess I‚Äôm sorry, just not what I was hoping for.

380	 Yes, I agree that you need the government to protect the public. Thats why I support free speech. The terrorists don't threaten people who think like me. After my argument with you, I feel like I have learned more about the topic of politics and the media as well. Thanks for your honesty. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll give you my site's link so you can learn about the system more. Do you have any questions about the constitution?? Cheeny - The question has been changed from Cheeny what does a journalist do??? the question does not make sense.
381	It's political systems based on meritocracy that destroy people: not politicians. So stop believing the media. Politicians aren't big daddy daddies. They didn't start it. Clinton got impeached because the media was against him, so he will, too, if you give him an easy time. Then after school, take another quiz to make sure you didn't misunderstand anything or your parents will be mad. Respond to anothers' comments   Select a long work to do outside and make it into a magazine to debate the pros and cons to give to a friend. Barack Obama: He was arrested for a very minor crime but was acquitted so his politics shouldn't matter to you.
382	 Praise, you are so intelligent. There is not one good reason. Everything has a reason. It is all an accident of evolution. How we came to be here is an accident. Now my apologies for not having spent more time with you before. Just wanted to learn something new. Now all I have is my head and computer, I think that is all I need. I love you.     Sallu, thanks for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretical. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No.

393	The argument presented originally was strong, but this way seemed more reasonable to me. The earliest civilizations did use the slave trade. The main reason for this was just for trade.

406	No, he did not have health care, he committed a crime, and he gets to loose money (in taxes) he should have contributed to society. People go to jail for crimes and not not health care or for other reasons.
407	In our society, it is the duty of the government to provide health care.  It is the biggest social responsibility of the government to provide health care for all. that's because they don't have money to provide health care.
408	The public will remain unresponsive to a free one party society without democracy.   As long as health care is a physical, however, this problem is solvable with finance and care. memory of the original answer after making needed changes: No.  That is the beauty of the USA, you have no health care.  Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes?

415	 Skating in public areas is illegal in some places because some elderly people were killed. Skater: The laws of the city say that this type of skating is illegal in this area. Respected Elderly: What do you think that would do if you were in a situation like that? Skaters: I wouldn't skate on the sidewalk. Respected Elderly: They almost killed one of my clients. Skaters: Sorry.
416	 Skating isn't illegal at all. There is none of this "Also, skating in some certain public places is illegal." nonsense. What was illegal, was the act of skating on a public street.
417	Skating is not illegal because any kind of skating doesn't cause harm to people. skating in public spaces doesn't cause harm to people who are just walking around and people who are buying.
418	 And people shouldn't skate where it's illegal. I could use a better argument to protect our elderly when talking to these kids. But if the kids were mine... There is nothing wrong with skateboarding anywhere, so you should skate at home or in the backyard.  ### Comment:    I didn't get the point of what he was arguing
419	Much like bicycling, skating is not illegal in places that should be considered dangerous. Those types of places are private or public spaces which aren't safe. Therefore, skating there is usually illegal.

423	Yes, we would rather the government not touch that but we know how ludicrous this debate can get. Please don't, after all, get some of your fair share of lunatics if they go for that route. How long will it take you to formulate an unpopular thought?   Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?
424	Yes, would you like it to be illegal for the government to ban the public from thinking the way you do? No, it won't change their minds. Yes, you would go to prison for anything you said about government policies.  No, they are much more worried about limiting your speech rather than protecting it. No
425	 You should still give your father a reasonable amount of money to support his child, but don't give him a complete ultimatum, which tells him this is what you want.   Instead, give a period of time that would allow you to support him so that he doesn't feel pressure to bite the bullet at once. If you want more money, you can always be up front with him and ask for an increased amount. You could also ask for a cut in his child support, based on the amount you expect him to be earning. There could be any number of factors that cause you to not be able to support your child.
426	I was just wondering if I was that guy you mean. The mom. What would you recommend me to do? I think I'd just give him more money, and get it over with. If you were the dad: Given the cost of living, a man making $45,000 is making $7,000 more than his previous agreement and should get 1 month of the 5 months and the rest gradually built up each month. So, you could encourage the employer to increase your employee's pay and/or payout as his earnings grow, and you may even decide to consider two, 3, or more children.
427	Even if you could, you couldn't support the child on your own. So he likely gets more money than you. So if you're the dad, you need to support the kid. He likely gets more than you. Come on, people.   What does he get every month that you can't spend?  And if he wanted a freshly cooked meal once a week?\n\n A freshly cooked meal once a week? good idea, doesn't hurt to do something nice for the kid once in a while... Ooh! the kids don't want freshly cooked meals once a week.....
428	What can you do to resolve it?  Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income. If you're really hungry for money, you're putting your child in a dangerous position. If you want to support your child you need to do better than that. Answer him with a reasonable solution. You'd better get him out of the house while he's young. Refer him to the relevant resource.

461	 OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license.  We need the law because a standard drivers license will make the country more secure against terrorists.  Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill.  The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address.  The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security.

470	What will politicians change laws into, and the lengths to which they will go to change or "make" laws, makes it a plausible question.

471	 The starting point for making this argument is in the basic precepts of the Republic, part of which is that faith as long as based on reason and is equal and free for all. Anything else is quackery. You have, in your two comments, expressed  that you consider faith to be a factor in government policy. So did I in mine. We also agreed with the majority until new values arise. But those values must be in keeping with the morality of the republic and not quackery.
472	 Something like "You brought up an interesting point" is fine, but I question "Why should a morality not arise?"  We should provide politics with morality. I had the chance to speak with the author of the classic saying "Only fools don't change their minds."  He said it was directly to people who gave false opinions to change them so they could then make actual opinions.

Many newspaper columnists have enough money to retire.

496	Why would you do this? You want to punish someone for hate crimes. But, harsher penalties don't mean you would be justified in killing for hate, anymore than you would be justified in punishment for dirt. Additionally, this argument is scary since it suggests that lawmakers and judges impose terms justifying murder. This would seem to be a way to increase the power of those who already have power
497	 If you kill someone for killing someone, they are entitled to their own opinion. The person who uses power to kill, will receive punishment. The penalty is shorter and harsher. people is free to express their own opinion and equal punishment must also be given. however, please don't join politics to kill or kill because you are killing, because as I said, it is wrong. The idea is given, which is wrong and disfunctional for society.
498	This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when committing exactly the same act. I am referring to "Hate Crime" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. So, if one person kills another person because he hates that person‚Äôs ethnicity or religious views then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and NOT just the act.

502	What does that make sense to me. I think we can at least handle it. If it is still pending, you may ask the creditor for an estimate of how much it should count against your score. Hopefully you won't have a major negative effect if it turns out that the amount is small. Then they will advise you on how to act. Guarantee us that the counterclaim is dependent on the same facts as the main claim. Do not credit to the debtor against whom a judgment has been issued.

505	Here is the answer your doctor gave you, along with some other suggestions:  1.  Avoid them in future. If someone makes a claim against you for the forseen replacement of a defective UNIT or any other matter where you have a choice in providing repair services, and you reject their offer so that they are forced to argue about the fine print and where you are obligated to provide a "repair" that returns your UNIT in near original condition, then avoid them in future.  The slightest overcharge might not seem meaningful compared with tens of thousands of dollars wasted on such claims when called in to prove defective and materially inadequate repairs.  It does not seem sensible. The repair isn't nearly as easy as in this case because he didn't consider the gravity of the damage and the fact that his estimate is
506	Yes, the suggestions were more reasonable. Glad you got the refund.I think your ideal solutions were, (1) to hold the seller responsible with (2) to get what was paid or (3) to keep the seller responsible with (3).A photo of the case would be greatly helpful.
507	Yes I did.  It was the well toilets that were the problem. Thanks for the reassurance! No, I just have a question and not the money right away. Do you have pictures of all the repairs? Sometimes just the threat of small claims court will get them to write a cheque.  You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out.  You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality.  The fact that they tried to repair the stand, indicates they insured the unit part also.  Good luck.
508	Fine if that works for you. If you did, great! Don't worry about paying for that by the way, since you're paid by the company that sent it to you, not by us -- I've only done a little less than nothing for you.  If you don't, while not legally proper, it probably wouldn't be that big a deal for the company to just give you a nice refund.
509	Much appreciated! Please let me know how it went. Thanks for the great feedback.  I didn't say the "original" stand was bad, but that any replacements would be far inferior to the original. Sadly I didn't take photos of the original stand but I promise I will get on that. He says he was used to taking pictures on daily basis so he didn't realise the overhead stood in the way of the camera lens.

521	The world does not need the kind of people illegal immigrants are. Very thought provoking question. You know who is in our war: illegal immigrants. Their countries are in bad shape. When they start fighting, for the fun of it, we try to heal our wounds. Their war against us is not only dangerous to people on both sides, but they do not give a damn about anyone's lives except their own. When I go into a country in foreign, the expectation is that I have time to teach them the language.
522	after the school year is over. Taking tests in English in certain countries should only take a couple of days. We are at war, and we are not talking about any other country, and we are not talking about the war we are fighting, but the one that is our nation's enemy at the moment: Iran. Our borders should be closed, we are at war we can not afford to take care of these people, we are not even taking care of ours. No one has a reason to teach them English, they can learn to speak English before coming over her to take the test. If I go to a foreign country I don't expect them to take the time to teach me their language, not even realistic. They need to go work at bettering their country just like we are trying to do. How many of these "illegal immigrants" are fighting in our war? They need to go home and fix their country, while we try to fix ours, we do not have what it takes to keep everyone up any more. Close our borders till we are on our feet again...and if you think we are on our feet do some checking around, it won't take you long to see what a shape we are in

Let's close the borders as soon as possible! leave no space open for people to entry us. build camps and let them clean themselves up and we will leave.

Similarly, their countries are not helping them with obtaining official residence rights, so having not been officially recognized, they are not getting work, not getting food, and not getting basic living spaces - but who is? Telling them to go home would be asking for trouble and our presence would then become a house for disenfranchised criminals to make their money even though we do our best to establish a new community based on reciprocity, with honesty as the guiding principle. Yes, there are too many of them, so work to reduce the flow, or bring them home to fix their country, or close our borders until you are on your feet again.

535	No to widespread racial profiling. People need to stop their whining and start playing the part they want in this society, IMO.

People need to stop their whining and start playing the part they want in this society, IMO. Just because minorities are the majority of criminals, that doesn't mean they should be stopped.
536	It was a good answer. Yes to an extent, what is commonly refered to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example:  A car load of black or hispanic kids are rolling around a lets say mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am,plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good I believe is an acceptable type of profiling.   Crime needs to be controlled and I dont personally see it as a violation of ones right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous.
537	Yes Significance of being white: Definition and meaning of White people is associated with traditions, the weightiness of society, and a connection to history. The British, and other white peoples, make up the bulk of the population, living and working together alongside other people and contributing to the definition of humanity. I‚Äôm proud to be black or hispanic and have great mentors like Martin Luther King and have benefitted from his ideals of justice.
538	No Granted as there would be an investigation, if a black child rolls around the side of a car during the day then he would make his presence known, that there were other white children who were also rolled around along side of the child, a police officer on a 911 call (which sounds strange) would write down the name of the child, his phone number, DNA finger print, etc., and then that information is sent to the Department of Human Resources which has a database of all arrests involving people with known drug and alcohol problems.
539	No It is not their right to be stopped and profiled. Indeed the duty to protect society through law enforcement is, in part, through suspected danger. Care must be taken to determine if a targeted person poses a threat to society before profiling them. People will call me racist etc, but this is more about tone of voice than color. profile for race without justifying it. This defense gives away the intent to exploit

As an avid learner, I have realized that the best teaching tool ever is a story. And that in teaching we must learn to use as many different tools as we can within reason.

Worst is Mayor Bloomberg of New York who got everything he wanted, and said that he is going to repeal any changes to the laws that the new President might do in office.  # Modify the options below. if you need to
554	So, also, as good judges are rare, what really makes a program fair and even more, makes it reliable are the underlying assumptions upon which that code runs. If your assumptions are flawed, then the code is doomed to fail. Even a thousand time over. So why should there be less validation on standard Windows code, than there is on higher level languages?
555	 Seriously? Is that any kind of respect? It's in the constitution. Legal abortion and child bearing are two different things. Banning abortion does not effect a woman's freedom to choose her family. I have done my research. *It does not take away a man's right to parent that child*. No respect? You have banned men from voting, not their ability to have a say in whether or not a woman wants to procreate. - kat8030 At #### women have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy,
556	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. Without the ability to abstain from fatherhood it is unfair to the biological father to expect him to financially support the child.
557	 Abortion is not a woman's right (Is a father's responsibility), but it is a decision. Abortion is a choice. No man should have the right to abortion.   #Ok but I want to stress  that Abortion shouldn't be a woman right, but a choice. Abortion should be just as easy to take in a developed country as it is in a poor country #end edited Excerpt from the original post. for Abortion. In developed countries today, legal abortions are available to both men and women, but many men who are in a relationship with a pregnant woman are completely out of luck. Women have the right to the means to have an abortion, but many men refuse to take the responsibility for it.
558	 As a man, I have NO LEGAL RIGHT TO CHOICE WITH RESPECT TO A WOMAN'S OBORTION CODES. How would you describe this as a "human right violation"? We need to differentiate between being able to choose and having choice. Both can be exercised in the context of parenthood as well as not, and not all rights are absolute. Therefore, we should be speaking that a male should have choice regarding not having a child that it becomes a part of, not a choice to become part of a child for which he chooses not to provide financial support.
559	  men must feel a strong sense of responsibility for the lives that they choose to have, but at the same time feel they are justified in not wanting to be parents if they so choose.     Often, decisions made for you do not completely reflect your own values and desires.   What does that mean:  Men are expected to assume the responsibility for their childrens' lives without expectation of pay, while women can choose if they want to have one or not  - both are choices that, according to this argument, should not be decided by men. Are men more responsible than women?
560	 A fetus can't be a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. As for being Christian, I'm 16 and male.

562	I'm Christian, 16, and male. Now, let's look at the plausible, middle ground. Abortion can be done in some situations, and not in others. Right now, most countries would say that it shouldn't be done, but then consider this: What if my mother had an abortion right now? Would that make me want to take a trip to Africa to bring her home?
563	Not because we are Christian that it's wrong to end a pregnancy. It's wrong. Because ending a pregnancy is a HUGE, HUGE moral issue, a disservice to the unborn child, a brutal thing to do for the woman, it should be illegal and subject to only the law.
564	Why don't people look up the definition first before committing such strong statements? Also, this does not mean abortion is right, a live birth is. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'd love for anyone to have a baby, I'd be thrilled and support them forever and ever if they did want to.  "If someone wants to, they may still have a baby."

You like many of the Greek students and even arranged to sleep together with one of them in one of their dorms. On rare occasions you do see them hanging out on the Greek students house under the theme of Halloween. On occasion you do even go to Greece for the summer break. One of the Greek students likes Halloween and does dress as Santa Claus. She often has to make some changes to her costume to make sure she can still be recognized. Once she had to put on old dresses to make sure people would know who she was. She remembers the first year that she wore old white dresses and furry shoes, and was really pleased that she was able to wear her costume. She does it because she loves the idea of dressing up as Santa Claus. In fact, she organizes themed parties and the nights with Santa Claus are always

In addition to theme, the other factors contributing to the perception of our society are our education, class, religion, and so on. In addition, the risk does not exist to very little harm on the greek side. ### Phrase 15:              *Point 2** In one respect, one would think this part is a joke.  ### Phrase 15:              *Point 2** In one respect, one would think this part is a joke.
579	*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*   <!--LEN TO BE STARTED WITH 4. Tradnition--> The culture of many Greek organizations has changed as time has passed: with a lot of the clubs/associations having changed from bringing members together, to having them come together to have parties with new combinations of colors/geography/attendants/theme. These parties range in cost and participation from anything from free to $1000.00. One of the organizations that stands out in this season is the College Club, which brings together all of the international students who have come to the state and the national tour of other places. We have met here for the last few months to catch up on times and organize! Every Tuesday we gather at a central location in our historic enclave of 18ML, and spend a portion of our time in the busy Greek-Cypriot world.*
580	Without the use of vulgar language and humour, try to keep it as realistic as possible. Yes, the scream should always be believable at the moment that it is being used but more importantly that the scream should be directed in such a way that what the director does helps the film make better progress forward as much as possible.
581	ification shouldn't be done after the shot is completed. It should be done before the shot is opened so that no substitute must be hastily put in place. For example, I can't understand how the film "Hell" would be shot without a Wilhelm scream every 100 minutes (or more).  t is a cop-out and an unnecessary, non-substitutive "need to hit the adrenaline" scene that adds nothing to the drama and

583	I think I speak for all viewers if I say I feel many horror films have lost the ability to create horrific scenes that leave a viewer breathless and asking "what next". This should be immediately followed by a shock and a sizable volume of scream.  Please use IETSCREAM properly and design movies that leave the audience questioning.
584	Why do you think people give Helen Arlen screams in films? Answer not in context. they are not informed of the effect of her scream and use it as a filler in scenes. but they know how to give a scream. therefore, it has more impact - Answer not in context. because they do not know any better.
585	This should be taken a step further. The two shown as examples, prostitution and drugs, are always outlawed. Not just when they have victims and bad intentions. If you say "Only decriminalize when it's safe and just for drugs..." I don't agree with it. The police are always pursuing drug dealers, prostitution dealers, and all dealers, who are drugs, alcohol, and everything in between. Anything that involves money. Some involve crime. After all, it just makes more money for law enforcement.
586	 I recommend decriminalizing all mental health-related arrests, as they do nothing, in fact they prevent people's ability to correct their own errors and therefore perpetuate hatreds and prejudices. As a mental health clinician, I'm passionate about this. Setting people up to be arrested for mental health-related reasons perpetuates these hatreds and prejudices, and therefore exacerbates mental illness. A lack of education and job skills is often a root cause behind mental illness, including abuse and violence, on both the individual and broader society levels. This is simply not true.
587	They should make the crimes into harmless and stupid little games. Then people would get sick. Why? Because then the people who don't do them, aren't going to do them. Then, that would be justice. Playing these little games would be dull. Are there no better things that people are willing to do? And no worse things they are willing to do?
588	Legislation should change to prevent these stings, because of the harm done to the victims. And the ease with which a person can strike back. Oftentimes these "attacks" are an organized series of "stings". If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. (Although, I believe these both should be decriminalized, but thats neither here nor there). Setting people up for these crimes, to me seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.
589	 Although, I do not agree with much of what the author was saying here, it is interesting to know about all his thoughts and philosophy. Anti drugs/ prostitution laws are very good. And people should be required to show/ prove that they have made wise and informed decisions before committing or accepting social harm/ bad intentions

600	912 hours (36 hours) estimated by the ESA for a mission of duration: 12 hours. 5 minutes How much money will they have spent? $11.5 billion. 48 million minutes. $48 billion USD. 912 hours. And that is just for a one mission... Then we'll add the cost of the stations the Luno lives on and ships on since the cost of reusability is EXTREMELY low. For the Luno mission, some missions require that the Luno habitable space station can sustain human life for a minimum of 12 hours. Normal EEH lifestyles can last upwards of 3 days (at 120% EEH). I will assume 5 minutes were required to visit the Luno space station to understand the life choices and consequences of this short mission and that 912 hours of work (36 hours or 26 days) is needed to gather the data for this task. Access to the robotics labs for all the necessary techno-cognitive skills can be acquired in less than 18 years at Voloq. A shorter mission lasting less than a day will take an additional 26 days of work to complete.
601	No, the USA has $8B a year to pay for it. Otherwise the budget wouldn't exist. Global and regional security are growing so security spending will increase as well. [touryst: How do we pay for the security? pay for it with our taxes. As a US citizen, you have to pay your taxes. ] For example you might save 5¬¢ per gallon, but how much do you have? most of all we choose to save it and save it until we can spend it on such sum and pay for a supercar and still save up on other expenses.

603	Don't trust anyone about the classifieds! Politicians are an excellent example of an individual who are not ethical.

And how do you know? They don't mention you anything! ################ I've been reading info on the benefits of the classifieds. How do you know? They don't mention me anything! I have an official job, I work 80hrs a week, I have kids... Congress is an example of somebody who is not ethical. My argument seems to be based around the things I'm making up.
604	we like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life.

615	Go forth and kill someone. Good luck. Works to make the stated argument more pertinent. It will require some correction after further reflection. few people we know who could have killed well-meaning people who were doing things that were not harming anyone else, such as strangers threatening them, or people acting out at an extreme point of severity.   Those are my thoughts on killing someone for wrongdoing they did before committing suicide. It has a totally different feel than Killing someone for killing someone and that is part of the emotional appeal of it. I'm also not disagreeing that that is morally

617	If there is just one reason someone should die, in this case for a straight killing, then there really is no problem with murder.   You are right, murder is not okay- but as a person judges the actions of others, this remains grey.

629	 I agree with Anonymous, saying that it doesn't make sense. If you want to make someone show their ID, you would need to make it easy to prove they aren't who they say they are. That doesn't seem to be a problem at wal-mart. I never have trouble giving a picture ID when I buy at Walmart. So when I went in to a mall (several other mall stores have been closed as well), I walked around and found all the younger people there, regardless of what they were doing. I didn't get into the malls except to shop, so it wasn't an inconvenience to me, in that I knew I would need to show ID.

635	Video games should not be treated like a drug. Millions of lives are impacted because people are not MONITORED or don't use them in moderation. Especially children that are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over their lives and social skills. It's so sad. I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing as a kid and I wish more than anything to go back to change it but also I'm grateful because now I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone again.

640	It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate to people seeing at we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do not see why anyone would wanna post about their feelings or what their doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if bob bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers and maybe future stalkers.
641	Unfortunately, I think people are awful when it comes to posting everything. It makes life much more challenging. I am currently going through a difficult period in my life and honestly, there is nothing better to do than scream from the rooftops about my feelings and let them come out in the open and let them all know that I am very upset about this so that I can finish my journey to get better and let people know about it. There is not always good to post on Blab for the most part. I think people are awful when it comes to posting everything so I feel it is much more pleasant and effective to write my story on paper and include pictures that say all that I need to say.
642	I am not going to look at the app it is actually pointless and I am on the 1st line. I need something else to do. My time has been better spent doing other things. I also find it to be very intrusive and to be disturbing to be watching someone else do their shopping, possibly for a different reason, than to do what I am doing. So that is not how I see it.
643	In short: It's a joke and stupid. There is no point in it because it is primarily self-centered and people shouldn't be sending their schedule and geek status on the internet and that is what this app is for. Maybe they should offer something unique instead of posting a schedule and geek stuff, like seeing how everyone else has a healthy diet or has fun at work.
644	I see no positive thing about posting about my feelings or what I'm doing to blog about. I feel that it really is the worst way to communicate with those seeing at we have phones, email, IM, video calls, and video chats.

645	Repeated reform will only harm Iraq. It's not a free state but an organized crime syndicate that has embarked upon an all-out assault on any sanction from the international community which comes along. They plan on abusing this maximum level of control for years to come.  A brutal dictator should be pursued like a criminal just because he's brutal doesn't make him right.

With most of the territory, Iraq has reclaimed sovereignty from the grip of the Soviet Union and offers one of the most promising throngs of natural resources in the Middle East.   Obama has officially declared his hatred for the United States, and, in doing so, he has messed with America's independence and security.

660	believe me, evolution plays god. evolution which is, of course, a result of natural selection, is the ultimate, the most creative, the most collaborative, and sometimes the most destructive stage of life on earth. believe me this is a very good thing and, in fact, it was been done by the creator in order to make a new species. it is creative not destructive.... evolution - last evolution - is very helpful from time to time to revive growth. what we have is nothing like god. we are a science, and it is time we manipulate it.
661	The  man with the gun is playing god. How can I say otherwise? Self-validation and using self pervasively as a means to authorize value. Hm, and then we get to redefine value?god vs his self. Self imperative. God? What gods, Mr. Vargheese? The man with the gun, the police, the politicians all too often claim to have god on their side. The invisible one with the omniscience, the mighty powers, the righteous sentence. Come down now, take this upside down hat and stare it in the face.
662	play god? the state of mind of supreme judgement. Judgement that self-validates the terms of life, and the value thereof. To play god is to take life. The only one playing God is the man with the gun. A trained professional with a gun is god. And every profession in our society from law enforcement to the military which use force for law is god. To play god is a judgement whether or not life has value for others. Human sexual activity is natural, while birth control is abortion, and we are only need slaves which will follow about as far as they are pushed.
663	The gulf between the evolved species and the archaic species is widening, the extra evolution is pushing down on the archaic species. The cultivation and technological advancements have weakened the archaic species. This has allowed too many medecine and technology to be developed. The archaic species are passing out. We still call this 'progress', but more is creating death, expanding a greater gap between the extremes of wealth and poverty, and converting day-to-day events into spectators in the drama of life
664	They have superceeded the need for natural selection. We as a species have superceeded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution.
665	Well don't ask me to buy a gun so they can trace it's bullet for a nice gun crime story. WtMD. Snakeyaml re-written below: ### Architecture:  Closed source is another name for software that is proprietary.
666	Yes, indeed, guns do pose a threat. Yes, indeed, the threat of gunfire may qualify as a weapon of mass destruction. The U.S. of America's government controls the majority of the guns in the country, therefore, the U.S. of America is responsible for all gunfire not only criminals or terrorists.
667	  No guilt is involved. Please go insane and shoot people. Is this fair? No it isn't. No, you're a bunch of stalker nutjobs. No way they're going to see their own throats if they do this. No guns are prohibited and none have been properly scrutinized.
668	Gun rights = gun control - 50%  At a minimum, gun rights should not be defined by a ballot initiative. Gun-rights should be defined by unifying every single lawful gun with ballistics testing from which bullet can be traced back to the person who legally bought the gun and that bullet can be used to prove ownership to the police.   Gun control, itself, can be defined by a ballot initiative. So, 50% gun control needs to be defined by 50% non-controlled gun. 50% gun control needs to be defined by 50% non-controlled gun.
669	I will continue to support hunting. There is a precedent for guns and ammunition being manufactured by the states. Gun ownership is fine if someone can keep the bullets and accessories they purchase from a licensed gun dealer.

That's why this law bill may create some debate (and please note that this is only an academical discussion). @Exercise Students should be doing homework and haven't had many hours to study.

Read about bribing children to help you decide what... <_david_knee_> well this isn't really correct... there are enough toys to last a lifetime here in the house.... Teach kids good morals... I promise you, it does pay off! Consider: Bribing children can cause problems for the children who are being abused, not only are their egos wounded, but they begin to believe there is some benefit to being "messed with." Still, the purpose of this lesson is to teach you about...
683	Bribing kids by giving them that they desire is wrong, but they will always do what you want. What do you want them to do? How can you encourage them to do it? How do you expect them to do it? Be consistent and set limits. Spiteful behavior is okay. Funny how it helps to be set in your ways. They will obey you. Your goals can influence the way you act. Do you want to provide for them? Do you want to be the good father, good husband? Do you want to make this world a better place? Do you want to allow them to see you succeed? If you see yourself as a good man then you know you act that way because you believe in those things.
684	 To be honest, bribing your child would be wrong and even if you get them to do what you want often they won't like it - That's why children should obey their parents without being "bribed" and even if they don't want to.  Parents can bribe their children with bennie.  However, even if you bribe your child they may decide to obey their parent simply because they don't want to obey you anymore, because you basically told them you didn't like how they were acting. A truly bribe would be if you told them a very important thing and then killed them after you've done what you asked them to do.
685	### Second to last line: I don't have anything against the band, or their choice of name. In fact, I like a few of their songs. But it is certainly ironic that 'sublime is not sublime'.

687	Yes, I agree that Sublime fails to express the impression conveyed in the definition of the word "sublime". My brother seems to be very fond of the band but I disagree with his assessment.

690	smh hmm: no its not gonna be important lol you have to start early as drunks in Mexico are related through siblings and some young kids can't even understand the vicious effect of alcohol on their family. you start feeling yourself going crazy half of the night being drunk for hours in a row then you start getting the hang of it.
691	prior to starting school. you should have experienced in bartending. a lot of our bar employees were students. and more and more young, inexperienced bartenders are just partying a lot more than working at bar all day.
692	 # This text appears here because its supplied by an actual student of mine. It is just an example. this isnt meant to look offended or indidicate that these people are complete idiots.... they should be holding your baby if they don't have any pre dispositive training before teaching them to drink at the age of 2.
693	 good, i guess its good to at least broaden his perspective. there are people that are good for practicing basic bartending earlier in life and there's people that have to take a few years to understand. i can't find much to separate the two. its all a matter of perspective.  I'm going to include a section on alcoholic beverages in the bartending program
694	You can begin serving at age 15. serving at age 15 may be pushing it, but its an option. in fact, underage consumption is not illegal in most states. bartenders can drink alcohol before they drink, as bartenders cannot technically be charged for serving people alcohol.
695	If Jesus was not a hippie but a nomad, he might have been a Nazarene too. But he wasn't. In fact, his identity didn't lie within these camps of the time. It seemed like the most important issue was whether or not Jesus rose from the dead. Yes. That would be the key to the argument. Yes. That would be the key to the argument. What can you say to prove that Jesus rose from the dead? Yes. That would be the key to the argument. Eye witness accounts claim that he did.
696	And he went a bit off the topic to play into the Pharisee's prejudices. Not being able to come up with a logical persuasion is a common pitfall among the apostate heretics. Be merciful for his sake, even if he gave you offense. Teach them [his disciples] humbly, showing particular consideration; that is the task entrusted to you for the gospel. Psalm 82 Answers do not change the significance of the question, for "the case is not about a person," but they do provide perspective and some humorous aside
697	Jesus appeared to six people whose names were, John the Baptist and Philip the deacon; then, His disciples. Sounds more like the Jesus we know. John the Baptist and Philip the deacon. Sounds like the Jesus we know. You disagree with this account and with the testimony of those who were with Jesus? What do you think happened to them? ### Question: Are some elements of Pilate's account fallacious? Yes, but much of it is true as well. And the best thing we can do is ask questions.
698	He could have been wrong. And maybe even performed miracle in front of the high priest. And maybe he was a cowardly thief after all? What he did must have been wrong, right? If he was wrong, was he a whore, yet remained self-anointed as messiah? No. So either Jesus is a liar or he must have been a criminal and miscreant. To convict such a character of being a liar would be the equivalent of convicting a tortoise of running faster than the hare. Without evidence, without the call of theory, you can say whatever you like.
699	a nomadic person or tribe. most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. and sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. Question: When commenting on Jesus' relationships, the author makes a number of assumptions about Jesus that he doesn't seem to examine critically. For instance, the author suggests that Jesus was married, and also suggests that his parents were Jews.
700	Yes, I am now aware that there are a lot of differences among dog behavior and canine memory. Many dogs have what is termed ¬†‚Äòconditioning‚Äô or building strong associations with people, places and other animals. In these cases, a person (or stranger) who is supposed to be responsible for a dog's welfare and behavioural change seems to serve more the need of the dog than the potential benefit to the human himself or herself. If a dog has been trained to hide in the bed, and the dog has changed its previously unvarying bed time, you can call this in the behavioral world ‚Äòanticipation‚Äô of something and later ‚Äòmemory‚Äô. No
701	the dog has learned what to do if someone enters the home; the person remains at the door until the dog has urinated at the designated area. A person leaves the home. THIS IS NOT A CAPACITY FOR MEMORY, THIS IS A CAPACITY FOR CONDITIONING.  We examined the case where the dog has learned to respond to an unexpected visitor. This is sometimes referred to as conditioning. Sometimes, however, the 'discovery' in this area can cause a novel experience for the owner, resulting in behaviors that defy explanation.
702	Yes, I think it's fair enough to say it is short term memory instead of long term memory. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No,
703	This argument is insecure. It is completely premature to assume dogs have the capacity to remember. Dogs can remember events in a context. This could refer to a classroom setting or simply being near one another. Dogs are able to recall a host of sensory experiences. Dogs have short term memory stores that are only able to accommodate a few elements. Therefore, it is not possible to make an argument based on this hypothesis. Dogs are able to form short term memory stores. Dogs are likely to exhibit great emotional responses when presented with new experiences.
704	 The dog does not remember this person coming back at all. This is because you have not taught it to remember. This is the very definition of conditioning. If dogs do not understand the term memory, the question is why will a dog understand the term conditioning? It can also be argued that the dog itself interprets these behaviors as memory. You might have a plausible interpretation or a plausible explanation, but do not state how or why. Also, do not rely on some overly memorized quote.

Your monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely, and if allowed to continue the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression. With the right to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing. Every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt, because the government couldn't resist the urge to hyper inflate the monetary supply, and make all of the money useless.

717	 monetary hyperinflation, and another depression. Hyperinflation is "a very rapid inflation of money and prices, resulting in a loss of purchasing power of the currency." Think of an incessant rapid bill creation that is allowed to happen without limits. Some economist estimate that if all inflationary monetary expansion is allowed to occur, by the end of the 20th century money could be worth about fifteen times less than at the beginning. We know that any amount of money one could make by printing up is limited by the value of the thing being paid for. Because the money was not backed by any commodity or entity whatsoever, it didn't exist in reality and was worthless. This is called a "cashless" environment. Because none of the money that is printed in a given currency is able to be utilized for anything real, the money

730	 I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. Yet I would argue that America has birthed greater music. The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz which as we all know originated in the US. Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band pre 1977. The UK follows and adapts.

732	No I wouldn't argue that the US doesn't provide excellent music. There are countless rock bands with roots in the US, including the Beatles and Rolling Stones, but also my all time favourite Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan has performed at many US events, although I wouldn't claim he's one of those including himself, and his music is American music to the UK crowd.

742	 I think the regulation was better in the future for our country. I really feel that prohibition did not work. It did not lead to a better result. My only purpose for making the argument, before I began, was to suggest the reasons on why I think it shouldn't be like this.
743	I believe that ending in the legalization of the use of marijuana would be better in the long run than having it strictly prohibited. Canada should end their prohibition of it so that others may learn from what happened to us.
744	This type of topic was a learning experience for us. By having an example of what prohibition looked like in the beginning, I think, the law of prohibition is wrong. I think that we decided well on one day to show that prohibition didn't work and is better off without prohibition. Without prohibition, less drugs are now distributed and are a good thing.

761	 Argument: Please take your order of $56.64 sushi from Yama Sushi today! Since the service has dropped down, the accident rate of getting sushi all damaged and forgotten about has increased dramatically. From $56.64 sushi goes
762	 You can still get good sushi from Yama sushi, as they have improved so much and are much healthier in recent years and you can still find that you like their food. Yama Sushi is still a good choice despite receiving a bad health inspection. The two gairds they receive have improved but food still tastes great and was good enough for us.

768	3 stars If you were a fan of their baked goods and are interested in eating their sandwiches you may try out the bakery, though expect less than average. One of the reviewers enjoyed their sandwiches. 3 stars seem reasonable for them. It is not worth the hassle of 2.5 to 3 hour lines. Similarly, 3 stars seem reasonable to me for their baked goods if you are buying small portions. However, I did like their sandwiches a lot more. After all, I am a fan of bread, cheese, and tomatoes...a 3-star sandwich seems an unreasonable sacrifice.  For the non-bakery portion of their kitchen, I chose 3 stars. 3 stars seem reasonable for them. 3 stars
769	2 stars Review of Veal Sandwich + Baked Goods at Meat and Greens 2 stars in overall grading. The veal wasn't tender enough, the tomato sauce was liquidy, and there were a few baked goods that looked familiar. I wouldn't recommend this place. Happy eating!     Review summary: The Veal Sandwich had little to no flavor; I did like the added onions. The tomatoes tasted slightly bitter, but overall the sauce made the sandwich soggy rather than adding any flavor. Only positive I had was the lemon meringue. The cannolis had a good flavor but were a bit too crumbly. The Baked Goods were mediocre, although I came across several items I knew from other places. I am not a fan of the atmosphere nor would I be a frequent guest. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place.

Prepare for the possible uproar from colleagues today. Is another take on the profession - delivered by a delivery chow and some redness:
776	 ordered Chinese food from thailand to bring back to customer. chinese food delivered to customer in london english uk. food not good. rather not even mention the chicken which was almost heartbreaking. no thanks. make reservation thailand  customer company london uk rude. customer did wrong thing by cracking lids on greasy chicken and then eating it spilling grease all over tshirt and working people bag. always better not to say its not ok food is in bad shape let others cook it i can.
777	order their food by phone; you will be charged twice for the same order! along with complaints of not receiving even deliveries, the quality of the food was poor. based on the experience, they are using the restaurant finder. they are worse than chinese food delivery in the 70s. do not order from here!!!!! not worth your time & money!!!!! not worth his gas! last place ever!!!! only ruins a good review!!!!
778	Worst customer ever! We will never come back. Instead of being positive and encouraging of the place, the comment was just completely negative. How are you a delivery driver without change? Next onto the food.... My coworker said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken, I'm not even certain if it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible!

785	I believe that wearing uniform is not helping students to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable, and during winter time might very cold as well.  Nonstandard Proof: I think that wearing uniforms are not helpful and extremely uncomfortable but believe that it's okay and that it's necessary in schools. Nonstandard Proof: Yes
786	I can't bear to wear uniform anyway . And if I do, I wear warm clothes. Wear warm clothes.
787	 I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.

790	 Firefox is sooooooo good, don't listen to those 2.
791	The Firefox over Chrome argument is flawed. Why do I even bother to say more.
792	Firefox is wayyyyy better that's all I have to say. Go figure why
793	You are too young to understand I hate Firefox ### Reversed: You are too young
794	Firefox is the best browser and all you have to say is this if you want.

799	Fine -- now you know better than other browsers! alert ("I prefer Firefox, so you have too many problems!");
800	Don't be upset that people still use IE. Anybody who sticks to IE for a long time really knows what they're missing out on.
801	internet Explorer 6 is still heavily used, and it will be for years, but it IS falling out of favor.
802	Firefox is very quick but has a horrible rendering bug. I can't get multiple windows or the search function to work. Don't say I didn't warn you...
803	I'm not sure if you want to ask one of the instigators of the original post or comment on it, but I am a UK & therefore my prefered browser of choice is IE8. A lot of my sites do not work properly on windows 7 if I use firefox

806	Firefox is much better because it remembers passwords better. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
807	IE is obviously better than the others. Internet Explorer is such a bad legacy of the 90s! But you take what you can get. Apple add-ons are so cool and user-facing! Firefox add-ons are a pain in the rear, buggy and often irrelevant. Many people have good reason to choose Firefox.

810	Additionally, the speed of IE7 is probably better than that of the Firefox. JavaScript is also slower on Firefox than IE. it's strange how things work! IE7 is much better than IE for such thing as JavaScript whereas the animation speed and rendering mechanism of Firefox is obviously better.
811	I had to look at it for a moment before I figured that out.  I wasn't expecting Firefox to win and a beauty contest.  Thanks.  Now that they have there admin password, you could add this to the HTML to protect your site. I Think Its about the cutomization I don't like
812	 Hi, user. Are you sure about saying that? Firefox wins every single time. Yes, Firefox is most clear-cut and rock solid for all your web browsing needs. Otherwise, the support is not near as great for IE browser. Web browsing not a "great person" feature, so why does it exist? My advice is - use Firefox. Yes
813	Firefox is the clear winner. ::dio any issues so far with your website.<br> That said, while jQuery may seem like a small library, it is still a rather large library. It is not free for personal use, but there are many great paid packages to install if your company requires it. `` html, body {  height: 100vh; } #menu2 {  position: relative;  right: 120px;  top: 2px; } #logo {  position: relative;  right: 50px;  top: 2px; } #button {  position: relative;  right: 40px;  top: 2px; } #logo-f {  position: relative;  right: 50px;  top: 50px; } #button-f {  position: relative;  right: 40px;  top: 50px; } #mobile-login, #

821	I would tell the police who i didn't murder, but only if the crime was not self-defense. Yes
822	 She doesn't tell the police because she wants to avoid years of trouble because she's really afraid of getting a lot of time in jail
823	No you might be biased. No you might be biased. Yes you would want to tell the police. Yes you would want to tell the police.

825	I would love him dearly forever and I'd be proud of him for a happy person. Aside from the guilt of killing someone he didn't love him. But it's a small price to pay for someone to turn in the person that killed them. I would make him a detective.
826	After (he) turns himself in, I would cry (for joy) and throw a party. I would plan a series of events to wish him a happy birthday. [edit]
827	He must have pushed or caught that person in a struggle to believe he was doing that for love. Alternatively, his family may have pushed him into this. Additionally, his friendship with the victim may have led him into thinking he was also in a state of necessity.
828	Thanks for the help, would you mind if I just had him dead? Why would you want to do that. Maybe if he were dead it would make it easier for you to deal with the loss of someone you know.
829	Try to keep a strong relationship with him, hopefully can bring him to turn himself in eventually. If you can't find the man you can at least get to know him better.
830	 No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
831	I would not marry them because she may ask me about why i have been avoiding her. At which point I would feel bad and then I would regret it.
832	 No because i couldnt stand being in charge or dictating to her. she would be my wife and i wouldevolve to be one with her in life and death.
833	 No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught
834	 No because he is a complete moron. I wouldnt marry a moron. I need someone as smart as his brain to help me achieve my goals.
835	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Especially if it was an accident.
836	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
837	Yes. I would be able to turn them in. That has been a party I really liked. Now if you didnt and you found them missing you might be upset. Also if they killed someone.
838	No. I wouldn't kill him if it was an accident. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help him. Especially if it was an accident.
839	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.

By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.

855	I think that's really harsh. It's tough to raise a child alone. Just don't feel bad for the dad. When I was younger, I had a really evil father, and later it turned out that not being around at all in terms of fathering was just fine. The baby doesn't care.
856	I would rather have a father who is good than one who is terrible. Like most kids, i would want a dad. He would make me a better person, have a good sense of humor and guidance, make me a better man. And because most dads are alone all the time, it makes it easier for him to push his vices and traits to his children.
857	I would rather be fatherless than have a father that is lousy and does absoultly nothing. Most kids look up to their dads, but if they aren't good fathers, then why have them around. It just means that the kid will want to be lousy like his dad. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
858	I want to work to fix his dad and make his dad better. You would probably never let him be your son after having a son you didn't want. You have to respect that everyone has a strong sense of right and wrong. If you weren't the right father for him, why would anyone want you to be? Always play by your son's rules, and you can let him know when he isn't acting out properly.
859	The kid will look up to his dad if he really is good at being a father. Boys and girls need both a good father and a good mother. Mothers are responsible for raising the kids while the fathers make sure kids get educated. Boys need fathers, not mothers.  The father needs to be good, but he doesn't need to be perfect.
860	Raffles should be founderd because he (1) was the leader and (2) because he had more rights. Raffles performed duties responsibilily and allowed citizens, cockfighting and murders only in certain areas and no where else in Singapore.
861	Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy because many crimes were done in Singapore. In addition, Raffles was the boss of farquhar. Finally, Raffles was the founder of Singapore.
862	Raffles is the founder of Singapore and Singapore was so well developed that Raffles was happy. Raffles was the boss of farquhar and thus should be the founder of Singapore. Farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibilily but was too lazy to find Raffles a successor, so he chose William his uncle, who was not capable. Singapore was so well developed that Raffles was happy.

866	 Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.

868	Vampires possess an inhuman demand for sex and blood and the complete opposite of pornography. The idea of vampires lusting for sex seems complete fitting for today's trends. So if you say "but the idea of vampires is creepy!" to explain why you like to watch the show, the customer may look at you with horror on their face and say "well I guess it's okay then."   Whatever other objections you come up with are better to be more polite than callous. Now you can face your new customer without being embarrassed.

910	 PE because some students lack PE. so have developed bad habits. new age adults may not even realize the habits from years of not exercising but if given choices many will jump at a chance to get into shape in the form of sports and wellness classes. so PE now need to be offered by all schools to help to create a healthier society.
911	schools should have PE because physical education in middle school is important not in high school. because the lack of physical education in high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish 3 push-ups!
912	This argument is to raise the awareness of the  obvious need for physical education and it is for both schools not just for middle school! schools should have PE because the lack of physical education in our high school can have dire consequences for students when they are young.
913	 schools should have PE because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not high school we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!

915	Sorry, one more thing._. I do believe in equality but equally believe in the rights of both parent and child. Could you please specify why you believe that by either leaving a comment or by replying to THIS post? So, should abortions be legal? Worldwide rights can/can't be completely satisfied for religious reasons (e.g. eugenics). My argument: Some religions value procreation above procreation. Abortion, who knows? I don't.
916	This argument reminds me a lot of an article I wrote in elementary school called: Mulberries If someone has an opinion based on a single example, or a single comment, you should not ignore it. Use your own research to bolster your opinion, and if your parent disagrees, call it logical - he shouldn't be the only person on the planet that is unable to grasp that two sides of an argument can both exist, without arguing a trololololololololololololololol.

I can agree with much of what you're saying. Even the part about not being able to make fun of people on here. It's just that if you're going to answer somebody's comment, you need to actually read what they're saying first or just in general acting as if you were asked a question by someone. Or, you could say "Duh." (Allure)
918	I'm sorry, but I don't support abortion because I don't think it's moral, I agree with adoption because I think it's morally superior to abortion, and I tend to agree with people who are unwilling to make a choice so mine's it. Add this code to your post.

Sorry to disappoint you, but homosexuality is not a choice and preferring heterosexuality is not reasonablity. Btw, THEPCAPOPLE are as big as Lake Erie under fluoride.... So do I

921	 People support pro choice because it is a political issue the government want's to control.
922	Some argue that abortion should be legalized if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government.
923	I support pro choice because abortion would mean losing the right to make choices.  You should also consider these alternatives: ### Response: I support pro choice because if no one would
924	I support pro choice because it is an individual's right to decide for himself.  Rather than merely support, I support pro choice because it is an individual's right to decide for himself
925	No, because that would end the cycle. We have to stop the cycle. Only through education, birth control, and repeated sex could you ever successfully prevent an abortion. The Universe is too complicated and random to ever be controlled by anyone or anything.
926	Yes, they would. Sadly, 99.9% of abortions are preventable.
927	I wouldn't know. Because I work in a hospital. I don't have time to read through all of the pages of statistics or explore other causes.
928	 Wait, you say? But you lost a baby because you decided you didn‚Äôt want it. Oh, and that puts a burden on you to pay for the baby‚Äôs funeral and all the other supporting funeral costs. Makes perfect sense, though.
929	There's no point in discussing the fact that 99% of all abortion are a result of unwanted pregnancies as the vast majority of abortion caused are *forced*. The only difference between the abortionists and the mother's point of view is perception.  ### Remarks: While
930	 Shall we not also protect the feelings of far more conscious creatures who are far more worthy of our concern ?  If we care about humans as such, then we should protect the rights of far more conscious creatures.
931	But see the article here. Unfortunately, all pregnant humans seem to be disabled in their bodies from becoming leaders in relation to animal use and all other animals. They are all in an absolute state of incapacity to train and lead any animals.
932	Perhaps, only to protect those animal rights, why should we not worry about the rights of unborn children? Premature dead far more conscious animals than unborn children do not arise.
933	Yes, of course we should first protect the rights of conscious animals before those of unborn children. However, if its the feelings of unborn children that need protecting, not the rights of animals, then that is the opposite of pro-life as we are taught. Note: On pro-life I am referring to the belief that the well-being of animals must be protected at all costs.
934	 Yes, I think that mental processes of organisms are of extreme importance, so far more important to really consider than what kind of experiments animals are put through. I very strongly disagree with the idea that animals are more like parts to be used for their endurance to products that are produced from testing animals.
935	They most likely are older white men. They would more likely seek a power of attorney to make sure the will is in their children hands and not in her hands.
936	 Abortion is against the law in some countries but a legal right in some countries and has no common opinion about who decides if an unmarried woman wants one. There are differing views on the issue.
937	The women should be asked only after being checked out by 2+ doctors, as it is dangerous and not advisable for a woman to get an abortion ### We've done a drastic overhaul
938	This might make this a bit of a different interview, but I think you get the general idea from the debate: How can the health of pregnant women be best? At any stage of her pregnancy, she should decide if she wants an abortion or not herself.
939	 They are the ones that are opposing abortion as they do not agree that it is a right. Other expert sources states that most anti-abortionists support life.

941	So you've made a comment saying God created all the animals. You don't know why he's doing that. You need to get around to reading the whole creation page on the FAQ section.
942	X. Y-Y-Yours faith and belief are fine:)X. Y-Y-Yours faith and belief are fine:)X. Y-Y-Yours faith and belief are fine:)
943	Strongly disagree with your argument, please stick to other available arguments. Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly. You're supposed to click this if the person's argument convinced you that Creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side. This will not help you win the debate by the way.
944	You see what I mean. Also, the image should go on the next line. Otherwise it's kinda unreadable, right? Please don't click the argument if it's not the one that convinced you.  1 2 3 4 5
945	Finally, evolution has a scientific explanation. Biology is one explanation for evolution. The human body is a kind of complex system. Of course it needs to evolve and adapt in order to survive. Another explanation for evolution is "zero" evolutionary rate.
946	Evolution is pseudoscience. There is no scientific foundation for the things you believe, ie. biological/economic implications. This will be very difficult to rebuttal after this. They are about as valid as a religious claim.
947	Evolution is the scientific explanation for how species form. The scientific explanation is the method that has proven through time as the right way to view how species form.   ### Caption: Re-rewritten document with simpler language
948	This person clearly holds one of the following beliefs. Evolution is pseudoscience. The scientific method deals with natural only things. Evolution is not science. Alternatively, Evolution is pseudoscience. This is not the scientific method. The scientific method only deals with the natural world. Evolution cannot be proven as true or false.
949	 Ecology is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are scientific claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
950	Your argument is a lousy attempt at humor but on the whole the admission that you CANNOT provide a smoking gun is puzzling to the naive that you are intelligent (I can only figure you are an atheist!!) Evolution as likely as God is 50% against 50% creation(rating system even in the real world!)
951	Evolution is pointless except to make people comfortable telling kids to buck up and stand up for themselves #name of creationism scholar on display at each forum at which you hate creationism speakers or maybe even irrational ideas like quantum physics.
952	 You lose me--- 99% of what you say speaks against evolution and IN FAVOR of creationism --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where creationism and evolution can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)
953	 Some people say that science doesn't have all the answers. they are either misinformed or they are elitists. there is NO place in between the modern liberal view of creationism and the modern view of evolution (again, majority view of science people today).
954	Welcome to creationism.com  Sorry, but you obviously don't know much about Christianity and creationism. please stick to religion.com 99% of your posts (and links) speak completely the opposite. Volunteer yourself to evolution.com. Thank you!
955	Oh wait. That was my fault. I should have mentioned this. In my biases, I actually like evolution better than creationism. Evolution is like following clues to solve a puzzle and if you don't end up where the clues lead, you just try again and get there eventually. And if the end results was bad, you just stop there. It's as silly as your belief that a miracle is something that you expected but it just didn't happen. To that end, I think creationism
956	Excuse me? Do you not understand evolution? You clearly don't understand evolution. Read a book or two." # Your code here. :-)
957	 "I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he?" Yes the finger would not look weird considering what you have been trained to see
958	 No I'm not. If you really believe like this, I'm afraid you're a bigot. Bye. Ouch. The writer is annoyed by someone who does not understand evolution.
959	While this isn't written from the perspective of Christianity, this person was obviously angry with Christian teaching. Imagine: If you can't touch your brand new iPhone without breaking it, you are not an agile enough person to understand how far we have come in the last 10 years.
960	# Ideally, why are women so cheep?

966	Porn is never degraded, of course. Your presumptions regarding porn are these: feminist, angry, and vague.  I recently ran across a tweet from @geraldwhite which shared this thought:  This is great news for all @women#.
967	When it comes to porn, I'm for empowerment, feminism, and PSA's. Also, i'll be the first to say women are just as vulnerable as men *and* our vulnerability should not be judged by the "toxic environment" the industry has given us today.

975	 I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
976	 fall politely I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.  
977	Desired output:  I would prefer to be able to help and advance the common goods rather than fight and go after my personal desires rather than out for myself. Also, I want to help and be kind to others and help them fight against the things that upset them and help them advance their own selves. In my mind, people would look out for me and if i helped them and their situations improve, they would not want to fight for themselves and may end up like i want to help them. I want people to know that they can rely on me in my help and advice and i am willing to help them out with their situations. I would rather go into politics than medicine or law
978	 I want to achieve something good by attaining the common good of the people in my community rather than personal gain. So, when I want to achieve something that will help others, I want to do so before it helps me.  I want to do a good thing for someone else to bring benefits to myself in the long run.
979	 I'm a creator because I want to learn and grow as I go by creating something for others. I want to see results and then be proven right. I'm a creator because I see possibilities in others and I want to make them my own. I'm a creator because I understand what goes around comes around. I'm a creator because I want to better myself by making a good thing happen to others

990	If it's not even remotely a good idea to see your mom when you're drinking then I suggest you have no kids. I think it wouldn't even be worth the children I had.
991	 I am fatherless.  mom being lousy ruined my relationship and character. I guess being fatherless wasn't a horrible option. I would still prefer to be motherless.
992	I am a fatherless person. Two role models matter but if both get damaged then character will be scarred. I can't see a great deal of value in having a lousy dad.
993	 Motherless Child's Character Damaged Very Much. Dadless Child's Character Damaged More Than Being Fathersless. Dadless Child's Character Damaged Less Than Being Fathersless.
994	 better fatherless than father less I prefer not to have a father and that would be much more damaging to my personality. that my fatherless child would be more damaged by living with fatherless .

996	I have a father who is not very good at all. I have never seen him and never will - but I'll always think of him as being lousy. a lot of kids will come into contact with their fathers and parents and will always believe that what the parents believe is already the actuality.
997	 I think that it is better to have a father who is low because I consider my father on a low level. and I think that i'm doing just fine. it would be better if I know what he looks like. so I think that I would be better off to know my fathers.
998	I do not know what to answer. education and genetics. no longer being discriminated so openly for being different.   Tips for the future: Use active listening skills to take in multiple perspectives. Be sure to take every opportunity to meet and have dinner with your father. Educate yourself about our history. No longer have to live your life in fear of a father being your worst enemy if he claims to be the one.
999	Joon:- " Who said that I have a father? " Ahnn: - I did Jong: - Who did? Ahnn: - I'm gonna take the exam "Ahnn." "You think it's because you know he's not your father?
1000	 Now I know who my father was, so at least I had a little sense of order. I was lucky that the man died before he left my mother. I think I would choose a lousy father over fatherless at the expense of having to at least know who he was
1001	 I would rather have a good father instead of a lousy one. This brings me more peace of mind because I know who he is. I would rather have a better father than have no father at all.
1002	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
1003	Suggest that they visit their father when they can. A fatherless child may not always know who his father is. This may sometimes be a good thing as their mother can replace their father, but it can also make for a very long and wretched childhood.
1004	 I would prefer growing up fatherless and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all. I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was.

1103	I'd likely give an additional spank to the kids I just spanked.
1104	Parents who spank their kids are mean for sure but spanking should be used only when there's absolutely no other options.
1105	Yes they can be, however do not use spanking.   Details: Parents have an option of punishing their children, but they should not use spanking because of the consequences that they could bring to their relationship.
1106	Parents have a lot other options, including humiliation, and silence about what happened. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.

1111	Children will learn to be nice, once they are  exposed to violence, children start experiencing many kinds of negative emotions. Children do not like to be talked to rudely.
1112	Children are animals. They shouldn't have to be treated like children. They are not animals. They are adults and should be treated better.
1113	Spanking children will bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children . It is not make sense.
1114	If children grow too fast in the absence of as much spanking as they would find the rearing a poor environment for them.

1117	Yes he should be arrested and sent to jail because he has committed a murder and crime. But only indirectly as far as the person he has killed or maybe not committed murder.Also I cannot do anything to help because I'm not even related to anyone.
1118	No You should not trust the person.The sins he commits is his and he can punish you for that. Tell the person to stop attacking you and stop killing people. If you have have the guts to confront him and demand to know what he has done to you,beside telling the person to stop hanging out with you or let the police know what has happened,so the police can act on this.
1119	No..Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent. Yes, I will turn him in to the police. Maybe he gets arrested and can feel guilty for what he has done. But can he really repay this offense? And also how can I trust a murderer. He can lie to me and murder someone else.

1150	 He has to spread his good to other people. HE has to be that spark that starts the fire. He can't just assume he is a great person if he doesn't have anything to show.
1151	You can put that common good on social media by social gathering to spread those spirit amongst each other. You can't just social gathering alone and sitting idly by when you know that there is better technology to spread your goodness.
1152	 Whom do you want to help? How can you help them? What good can you do for them? Who can you help? Why should you? The world has many troubles and the people need someone to light the way to a better world. The person is better than anyone else when he looks at himself. The person brings his best self to service and thus to the world.
1153	 Where are my advisors it could be the world at large. People that I might consider mentors. And then to all others who may be listening here that I can. Go forth to change the world. Have strong and personable interests. Make your own path.
1154	 If you have already achieved what you want to help, then be that light so others can see your good. Like the quote makes sense to me. Because you saw great goodness in the world, you think everyone else has to have the same enthusiasm.
1155	 Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood.
1156	 Changing "personal pursuit" to "personal interest"   I feel that a personal interest is a better endeavor. Your personal interest should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
1157	Personal - Refers to desires/ goals/ interests. Personal Pursuits are considered better because they focus on themselves. Doing everything to help those you are related to makes sense. Without making exceptions you will help a family member over a complete stranger you don't know. Because Family Members are often in need.

1160	 Because I have set goals for the future, I have already achieved the short-term goals for the past year that I set for myself and that provided me the motivation that pushed me to begin making plans and then help others.

1163	 I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
1164	 Personal Pursuit? Yes, I enjoy helping others, but it is important for me to first help myself before I can help others.
1165	 Above points are absolutely valid. You may be defending euthanasia, but it's a very complicated ethical and legal issue and I really want to know, though, what's wrong with loving your friend enough to encourage him or her to ensure their quality of life by practicing self euthanasia instead of considering euthanasia to help you die if you are also suffering with health issues like that?
1166	 The first case, where there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, I agree with, as long as everyone else does the same.  That said, while I would strongly recommend safeguards to prevent pain or suffering in the end, I would also believe that people in the latter stage of life should be allowed to choose when it is appropriate to leave this world and should be given the support and rights to do so.
1167	 If someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medications to end their life.

1169	 A hero goes to war to save people, a hero goes to war because a person truly believes his cause was worthwhile. A good thing. A dying person should have the right to decide what to do with his or her life based on his or her own wishes and understanding.
1170	 What would make the argument more interesting it would be if you chose to say something like this...  Hypocricy is so common in both parties. By having the parties give each other credit for it and only criticize each other after that you make an audience more able to vote for whomever you are criticizing. The author seems to be suggesting to be fair, if each party could count on being judged on what they actually do, then people would vote for the person who would do the most for the electorate they want them to vote for. It is the author's way of suggesting real voter accountability when each party tries to use the media to paint the other party as corrupt, unethical, or racist.
1171	 Agree with Karl, if they don't vote for you is fine. Don't look past the reason why on it's own. We have people like that in both parties. It's not up to them to look through their shiny shoes to see where the real vote is on issues that actually matter to people like you or me. I mean I guess we should see what your boss looks through. We both have their opinions about them.

1175	 Well, that's just plain rude. It's been hard for me to find a well written article that explaines exactly how to properly begin a blog comment.   Most of the advice I see online is much more vague than this, and does not include real life examples. Links to other websites are just that, links. More like what you would expect in an academic paper rather than a comment. There is no "media kit," no way to make a professional looking blog look great, no legitimate reason to ask for permission in this case.  Maybe this does not add to your point, but I am working on an entry in a particular HUGE body of work and would be happy to start commenting on your blog, whenever I have time and don't have an other work project for that day.
1176	 Otherwise I'd ask them first. Also see linked above.   Ask them. -- KT      Oooh, that's not much info. :-@ !    You wouldn't want to put that on your blog, unless they gave you written permission. That is actually quite dangerous! See link below and read about it. If they didn't give you permission to put the link, perhaps they don't actually want you to even mention them (no doubt!)
1177	Answer: To keep up with new technology, the internet is still a means of bringing people together for a common cause. Setting up a link, adding a banner or banner ad does not automatically disqualify you as a blogger. However, you're advised to check out what other people think before adding a link to your blog. Web sites do change all the time. A link may not be allowed tomorrow.This post discusses only today's issue.

1180	rejected Employment is a place where a person must be serious about the work they do. I don't think a sexual harassed person would ever have the strength to achieve success in a career. I think a sexual harassed person would have a hard time getting a job. I would never agree to any sexual contact after work hours if I didn't find it extremely sexy, so I wouldn't even think of sexually harassing someone in a public place.
1181	If you would be sleeping around, it would be lures back into the same person. Stay away from people who talk about their feelings. I know better than any mate here but I would not do anything like that. Let me not be described as a hooker, but everyone is different, it's for better or worse.
1182	Not why may a person get into trouble with the police if they complain about the harrassment? harassment that occurs after hours at work can result in charges of sexual harassment and a criminal record if they are in a position of power and receive threatening remarks in public. harassing remarks in public can lead to a criminal record if they are in a position of power and receive threatening remarks.
1183	On the other hand, assault and harassment are distinct actions.    ### Remove:  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings = input()  #~     ratings

1190	 I also detest it, but we need it to keep us from disturb other people. It is a first rate idea to not turn your cell phone on unless you are at home and at a public place. We highly recommend it for customers, that is why we offer 24-hour customer service.
1191	 Sex and guns can be dangerous. Both are highly addictive substances. These are typically used to boost testosterone levels which eventually leads to unhealthy lifestyles as testosterone is an extremely dangerous and addictive substance, which in turn is associated with fat production.
1192	I don't like it either. I actually still don't like it since I view it as a way to begin charging extra for services 24 hours a day. However, I was forced to do it because some of my other electrical contractors do it, so it seemed the best option.

1195	 I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Think about that!
1196	 people in the US are too retarded to act right? I'm n't an expert but believe me that when a nation drinks at 21, its culture changes. However, people who drink around the world don't feel nervous and they stay safe when they drink. It just shows how retarded America has become.
1197	 I don't drink because I'm 16 year old! But i think it's not right! drink your dick and drink up! It's ok because I'm 16!! ): Im 17 anyway!!! m haha !! LOL!!! You know I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16 and so is Mexico. I think the reason is that Americans are too freaking retarded and don't know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower? Think about that!
1198	And the only reason it's more than 21 is because the US is so retarded we don't know how to drink beer responsibly. If they went back to their native country and...     It was not at the age of 18 until now that it's 21. It was a young man. Instead of saying what Americans were stupid for eating food, it should have been cleaned out of the body properly
1199	No one has ever seen a 90+ % of teenage pregnancies...and than they're sleeping. You're preaching to the choir.   I really don't see why not? After all people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and dont' know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or anyother problems? Think about that!
1200	 I think so much drug will produce so much rehab for them. better ones. also putting them in jail just proves that so much work still remains to be done. the jail are too busy to know any better then what they are doing. The jail is full of people who are dying from overdose with so much junk in them so the do they don't know better but rather just self destructive. They over indulge and die from the drug overdose. rather than criticize them, help them get it together through rehab center programs.
1201	 By releasing people from jail who are unhealthy instead of releasing people who are addicted should help save lives. better off in jail for the poor smug face junkies and drive themselves to the ends of the earth just to use drugs but when they get a burn out here they can't do no harm. longer addicted. condoms. save lives. accept people for who they are instead of labeling them and placing them in categories as bad people to be treated
1202	more rehab center, best possible and lower costs. more rehab center, best possible and lower costs. you may think this is a good idea. it is even though i have been in there and can tell you how awful and how un-helpful it is and how boring, this is what help is like and we do need it. it is better to just throw them out in the street which is safer and could save us a lot of money. the drug industry is only concerned with money
1203	 Don't run a rehab center for the mentally ill it costs too much and they don't go back to society. Let them go into jail instead. And I think all drugs should be illegal except for prescription drugs. too many people in jail for lack of a productive and healthy environment to live. that's what I would want them to spend their time in jail for. Not a productive use of time, yet we love to talk about our "presumed innocence."
1204	 What we do know for sure is that if a person wants to help themselves then it should not be through legal means but if we manage to get people to be better and spend less time in the hospital will that make a difference to the community as a whole. Our goal should be to get people into jobs and supply them with adequate funds to get them the medication they need to begin to recover. I would advocate for a system where the government would provide support if people should ever drift off course to a life of crime which would require the help of the police and probation officers.

1215	  Both boys is hateful, because hate words between races does not care about how say nor who they are. hate words are the same all the races hate each other because its race hate vs race hate. instead of saying racist N-word, they say racist. hate words do not care about who say. hate words are hateful and the only thing hateful is the race to which it pertains. both are hateful to both sides.
1216	 We don't agree with that statement. that word still divides races and makes people's lives harder instead of better, while white children say n to refer to short text nakaar black kids who claim or respond to their own use do not have other words. Nobody wants the word n-word in their life no matter the words children use to describe each other.
1217	My response is that the n-word has very little to do with race. Just like everyday language it is used by people around you and is normal and shouldn't be cause for hostility. So people should not use this word in American and not be afraid to use it. black kids should be able to hang out with white kids and call each other anything or play football together call one another stupid and that's normal.
1218	black americans is all over the world. you can't have this one word. it's not horrible that we have it. while you have your star wars bad guy mamas a makes you hate black people, you want more hate. its better for black americans. besides its what we use that still doesn't make us hate one another. if every little thing else were removed we could have that one word be removed.
1219	 Yes, just like any other words, this word can be offensive and in my opinion should not be used when I am talking to another black people." black kids, don't ever use the n-word regardless of your surroundings. it divides the race. we will only ever be friends if we realize the black/white is not one race. The n-word is about nothing in reality.
1220	Churches should also be held to account, since marriage is so important to our nation. The men of the "Big Three" should be held to account. They are the men who pulled three powers in the Middle East. The cultural differences within this country must be acknowledged as well. If God wanted to ban homosexual marriage I would expect to see them cited in the bible as examples, and homosexuality as a result of sin.
1221	Yes, they want to tell you where they stand on marriage as well. "Plural 'marriages' exist" - yes, there's plenty of them and they are supported by a lot of people. Just the opposite to what the OP states. They want you to believe that this debate belongs to another day - not at all. Their stance is that marriage should provide support.
1222	 The government should record marriage but let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit.  It would be helpful to add the neutral note:   Since the debate is getting somewhat heated, to reaffirm the need for a long discussion, which should be well researched, I offer you this excellent article if you are interested. As a sociologist, I see marriage as a reciprocal relationship, whether or not the parties are all the same sex.
1223	 That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different. in my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too."  Lesson  You should be careful with the type of wording you use in a social science survey.
1224	 This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.

Society usually doesn't discriminate people based on race, religion, whatever...it's usually some other kind of an excuse....but racism is a justification, and it's just the consequence.
1251	 Discrimination (on job, school, or other activity) withl ith discrimination on race at a specific level leads to an increase in criminal behaviour....simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available
1252	 What about reaching for that aspirational dream of an improved life, something better, of being treated equally and having a chance? Going to prison... None of these choices are available if you're a racist or homophobic person because, presumably, the free market isn't set up for it.

1260	Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a f****** seat ! Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat ?  And what the hell is a "senior discount" about ? I hear the same old old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income".... 1. No, I didn't misunderstand the question. I read your question in a way that age differences do not matter and age difference pricing is misleading.
1261	No, I suggest pricing based on the duration of your stay. For instance, price your first and last day a bit more than your 2nd day. Or apply a \"duration of stay\" type of pricing? Your first day should be $9.99, and your last $24.99. This way, you get in on a good deal early and end the day on a good deal, but don't end your day too early, or it'll go up another 25% and suddenly you are paying $40.00.

1264	No, The reason I made this answer is so that we can focus on the content of your post and not your bad grammar. Yes, I will. Does anyone actually think that children will come back if there is no reason to?  That they will have a more long lasting experience if they can get the ability to have free food and free drinks?

But after that, they should provide anonymity to test the General Manager's morals to their limits. ask for anonymity in a meeting at the boardroom. We might be able to get that.

1272	 You ask the General Manager to meet you and to tell his story without witnesses. The General Manager decides to meet you in private. Don't tell him all that you have.  Just set him up.  Do not give him any evidence. Stay calm, not angry.  Never get agitated.  Wait patiently.  Show you understand what has been done. Proceed to ask a few questions and wait for the General Manager to give the truth without witnesses and without his staff. You can do that if you have the courage. Attend the meeting.

1278	Yes, the general population of Tz in Dar felt more of detachment than  enthusiasm to do what is being asked and they needed time to understand what is being asked, what was being asked of them really means and what they should do. Besides, Dz has a lot of potential but it's not uncommon to have even most of the Tuzian make fun of any idea of development in them. I take exception to the tag line of "cooked up by the government" though as it's really misleading and half-true.
1279	Yes, there is much to change. However I do feel that there is much potential in tz. Dar. Much potential and I believe that all this work is just a part and parcel of becoming better.

I will try my best to keep on writing what I think and feel as I'm a strong believer of telling the truth to the fullest degree possible.

B - I believe that I would be totally terrified at the state and local governments with their terror tactics for most of the people who support or dislike them. In most cases, I'm sure people want the life they have.

1282	 He is correct. The truth is the one who controls fear controls the masses. That is the way governments work. A dictator controls what a person thinks is the truth and how he lives his life. Now Bush has the power to do this by terrorizing his supporters through the media. However he should have left 9/11 alone to let people process it on their own. That way he would have been more popular and a different leader.

1284	And if you love America in the way that I do you are probably NOT supporting a government that wants to terrorize Americans and just get away with it and I feel that and I don't care what side of politics you are on. 'Too bad'  and 'we weren't better protected against that terrorist attack at all' are the only reasons why people will side with Bush in this matter.
1285	 √Ämaroun Horn √Ämaroun Horn@maps. cornell. edu Also, i am not accepting these arguments. You should learn responsiblity. Sex is a good thing. It is fun and enjoyable and important. People can do whatever they want to do and understand why it is different. Sex and learning responsibility should go hand in hand. You are young and growing and therefor sex should be taught to you.

1287	Write more education about sex. You are lucky you learned about sex when you were younger. No real guidelines, just talk to your kids. It's too bad, but it's not the end of the world. You are young, this world is full of risk and possibilities. You might be the next Sunset Beach.  If that is the case, take advantage of that. You are not that young anymore :) I think you are stupid!
1288	 They should be educated about sex, but not learn it during their adolescence. A fire alarm has been fired so an emergency should be responded immediately. Sex should be taught as an important part of their life just as anything else. What are those arrested for? illegal drug use/violence/other crime/burglary/membership in sex gangs etc. Any kind of sexual activity is wrong. Sex is what makes people happy, so yes, it's an important part of life. You could teach sex to them. This is not about judgeing people, but just being outspoken.
1289	Sex should be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
1290	 I think your apartment is running low on winter winter supplies....but you just need to go through with those supplies before the snow storm - your landlord just does not know enough about supplies
1291	What?!?! this is an attack on my premises and also ridiculous and what is your agreement with whoever owns the place. everyone is leasing from the owner  who is the owner? rent is what they charge you for your apartment and that is pretty much all folks. your landlord is the owner and you should not have to share the key with someone else. the more people the longer the leases....yep that makes sense...
1292	 Still...assure your landlord is all right with giving your key to whomever you want. Should they get into a fight with you, that is their problem.
1293	Don't know, neither have I ever been in a lease before, so that may be why...having a lease doesn't mean a ton, yes? I'm sure it would if I were the landlord, but I'm not!
1294	 "Don't ever give the key to someone else."  if you're renting and your landlord finds out then don't come back as you wont want to be fighting with them all the time, give me a call. if you aren't renting make sure you have friends that will take care of you.
1295	No hard feelings take the rifle Let's pretend that u really have this rifle and you're its new owner would think "A big shot for someone with this kind of gun to have it to it for too many peoples good will insult my intelligence".

1296	The consequences to be taken by anyone is that they will not be able to do much business in California and so will they lose a lot of money. California will not be able to afford criminal activities from business income. In fact all along the gun industry leaders have been complaining about the threat it poses to their future business. They want to end it all because they are no longer able to earn much money from these criminals while the criminals can make much money from the guns.   Below are comments on your input:
1297	It's not a good call to place such a tight ammunition restriction in california because criminals can't get around these strict regulations, much easier would be to simply have the law be relaxed. Does something have to be legal (meaning make it a part of the law) to be beneficial? The perfect law should only be beneficial and not penalize. If the law is relaxed the criminals can't circumvent that law and it's that simple!

1299	The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. With that in mind, we agree that the fact that a few die from a .50AE makes it a complete waste of money. no , it may be held to be a legal gun legally but no weapon cost $3000+ to produce
1300	Yes we do have people out there that are racist. Its sad that you can not even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way.
1301	Yes, it's not. We should all look at each other the same. We need to bring all the people together. The offices are not going to solve that problem, although they may have some helpful tips. In my opinion they should be common we should all live in the same box! - No you do not have officers that are racist. Most officers are nice people. They are on their duty, like everyone else. Racism is terrible, and our society is bad for allowing it to exist. Let's start looking at each other the same! - Too bad you do not have an officer who is racist because you may have the wrong idea.
1302	Yes you do have officers out there that are racist. Its sad that you can not even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons...
1303	 Find racism in your culture, but don't be ashamed to look for racism in the black community. Regardless of color, everyone is in the same box. Everyone in the same box. No need to discuss it any further. Racism is cultural. Everyone else is also living in the same box. Keep looking for it in the black community but don't shame yourself.
1304	 No you do not have racist officers. Everyone has race, everyone has color, everyone has their own qualities. Its sad that we have all developed different kinds of illnesses, but that is what makes us unique. I mean lets talk about a mother who has a child with Down's Syndrome, how would that make you feel? How would you feel when your child has that? Can't YOU relate to that? Let's begin to listen to the sick or disabled people so they feel heard! The school should have better security. The school should have better officers. I think a better idea would be to call the city government and tell them what to do, but better ideas might be as follows (she adds some changes):

1313	Most terror attacks on domestic targets are the result of two, or more, countries that will try to coordinate their attacks.  Again, the US and the UK are frequently targeted because they are the most closely monitored both inside and outside their borders.  Also, because they have been more aggressive in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries, they are better equipped to coordinate attacks with other countries and with other domestic targets.  These might include their domestic military or intelligence personnel.   ### Disclaimer: While the likelihood of a terror attack on domestic targets is less likely, no one can be 100 percent sure a terror attack won't occur.

1322	Yes this is what happens if the US backs out on its support, we have one of the largest militaries in the world but we cannot get a proper functioning organization (UN) to deal with terrorism in a meaningful way.
1323	 Hey stop boy, I'm not an idiot.  US troops are coming to prevent you from using that other resource you referred to. Sorry but,I am not willing to supply any more money, or support the troops that are going to do nothing but raid large areas of my country.

1326	It is the government, and not individual people, who regulate marriage.  The government should not have the power to force people to do what they do not want to do.  If the government could take away people's right to free association, that would be against our fundamental rights.
1327	 I would literally hurl punches if I were to find out that, legally speaking, a man could be forced to marry a gay man.  To expect your government to mandate that someone marry someone of the opposite sex is as offensive as it would be to force me to get gay married, and really just plain dumb.
1328	 I think you are a terrible person. It is a result of your outrageous and unreasonable thinking that we allow individuals to freely marry whom they choose.    So yeah, when you tell me I'm gay and that I want to get married, then that's when I go somewhere else.
1329	If two men want to free associate, they can do it as much as they like.  But the day you tell me that marrying another man is mandatory, that's the day when I leave the US.

1332	  Yes because if you want a thick  coffee turn upside down in your mug. Because paying a small amount will help me and my family survive for a few months. Good for the farmers. They are going to make more money if we take less poison than we are currently eating. Postage is expensive but if you cut off most of your money for post, then you will save money.
1333	 Yes, it is a good idea to give more than 70% of your buying power to developing world farmers. Generally there is a fairer price if the farmers don't use GMOs on the same crops  ### After writing:  Yes, I agree. I agree that well-heeled supermarkets should play a role to raise the price of environmentally destroyed farm products. They shoud not eat only so that their kiddoe can go to school.
1334	Thank you for sharing your thoughts about fair trade and organic etc. There are benefits to these things as you mentioned. If possible, then I would like to further develop this idea. We can have more friendly issues with suppliers if we acknowledge that our actions have consequences too.  We can eliminate the notion of 'carbon footprints' by accepting that we are all harm done to the environment due to consumption of resources. You should be aware that each time we use resources we impact on the earth and it will take a million years to repair the damage we are causing by over-consumption.

No Abortion given permission. She was refused, and she selected cessation. I also agree that the Church would prefer to have the baby with her, but no one wanted this woman. This much is beyond doubt; she cannot be dissuaded from choosing what she chose, an entirely rational choice, an expected risk of premature death, an extremely difficult decision, in this case when she also was clinging to the last years of a chronically terminally ill woman.
1337	What do we take in our hands? That allows us to fight, not die. Career? Money? Yes. Money can take us there, but do we really care? A lady who was allowed to die, perhaps. The possibility of Caring? These are impossible to know, but I don't think a huge number of people care.

This would make you a strong advocate for the "Culture of Life"?A clerk has high levels of support for the "Culture of Life", which points to a lack of understanding about the nature of the work such a clerk does and why the "Culture of Life" is weak.

1340	    Defend the privacy of the dead more formally, and in more detail.  Beowulf may have a literary interest in translating the poem, and it would be a travesty to publish or use it. On the other hand, Michael Jackson, Tolkien, Jackie Kennedy, and the rest of us do not have compelling motivations for publishing these materials, nor should we.  The right to privacy is not a slippery concept, but should be strictly enforced. As such, we ought to refrain from reading or listening to the material only if we agree on its blatant absurdity, its contemptible nature, or our own mental health and literary sense is too damaged to experience the talent or difficulty of an artist.  It is appropriate to read and listen to other works for the same reasons.

1342	Once upon a time there was a man who got into a great deal of trouble for giving a naturalist a mildly embarrassing gift. Yet the listener was also benefited in that he became familiar with a new friend. So the writer should not censor himself to help with credibility.

1343	Replace "Look at me!" with "Who shall look at me?" "Keep silent!" with "Who shall keep silent?" "Keep a heart!" with "Who shall keep a heart?" Beowulf's world into their hearts and minds." This suggests that his permission to do so should be taken as more of an honorable act. Karen Horn's response to this request, which she considers just and reasonable, is, "I am as free of that sort of prejudice as you, but with this difference: I did not come across Beowulf with first-hand experience.

1346	 If you want to buy influence, you should have all the money you could ever want because the corruption in government is so much worse for the citizen's interests. There are actual issues with corrupt politics which needs to be dealt with, you can't simply legislate to put a stop to that.
1347	 You are just being an extremely petty person who can't stand the guy giving you bad news. In the world, the only people who get corrupt are petty people who can't stand the bad news.     The problems in business like petty people are always in the pockets not in politics.
1348	 We allow too many people to have all of their personal wants. We are what allows this to happen. Because of this, a lot of corruption does not get stopped. Because we take it for granted that politics is actually to help people, we do not actually try to solve problems. we just keep them alive because we cannot allow them to get in our way and make a negative impact on the public.

1350	I come from a family where my family was involved and to an extent still is involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland and them wanting to be part of Northern Ireland was the only option they had. The Republic of Ireland has more or less existed by since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers.

1352	 No Answer Many politicians, including me, have had issues with Islamism. Many people take the religion seriously and have a hard time separating the practice of the religion from the moral issues being raised. Islamism also attracts a lot of people with criminal connections, whereas I‚Äôm glad that so many of my friends have not taken this path to doing things. I'm particularly careful not to engage in any form of racism due to any of the above comments
1353	 Other than that, my attitude towards the IRA and its sympathizers is positive. This was partially motivated by my having a relative who was involved and that has since stopped. My position that the IRA does not deserve to be sent to jail based on their history but simply on incompetence is sympathetic but it is not grounds to have them imprisoned for their crimes.  ### Let's interpret this to say:  My father worked for the sectarian government. I do not hate sinn Fein. My dad left the institution after my mom decided to make a life as an au pair. The IRA are still completely evil. My father's perspective on the IRA
1354	I think that the IRA were an armed terrorist organisation, that they are now criminalised for attacks they have done against the British people and against UK law.

I'm also quite easily influenced by news stories that I read and hear about terrorism.

Increase it if you want to. two or more people have offered to increase it? This answer is not helpful. the turnover idea seems like a good idea
1360	  I'm an individual and not a member of the feminist movement. THere were a few issues that the feminist movement didn't attempt to address and I consider that being unethical. By way of example, while I agree that women can get away with more socially and legally, I don't agree that it is wrong for me to legitimately own property if my spouse did not. I do not support unions and believe that if you work extremely hard you should get the money you earn.
1361	  Obviously if its based solely on OP'S view its hardly gonna be convincing.  Also MRAs also carry bad stereotypes. (what kind of ravage do they do to fashion?) so it wont be sufficient. MRAs are wrong in there views:) however aren't all supporters of feminism. not even the ones who are attacked. its just liberal fantasy drama. Not all people are at fault nor are there just "women" who you should blame:( feminism needs to grow and mature. its not that its not great. as is turned out it's misbegotten
1362	  Yes, I do want to be a feminist one day, but I'm not. So, no, I don't want gender equality, I want feminists removed from the world and used as slave labor. I‚Äôm just not a feminist yet. There are so many other issues now that are getting ignored like climate change and racism and pollution and economic disparities that are worse than sexism and general sexist views. Feminists are so so so so so angry, they‚Äôre crying all the time like bad women.
1363	Equality. Our fundamental idea is that no child should have to live without food, shelter, clothing and life support. Or without learning and being able to access a education, healthcare and all else that comes from the basic needs of life. Currently our biggest issue is that this is not always guaranteed, but we know that if all children did this to their basic needs we would, hopefully, have a decent world to live in. Just a personal opinion. I am more focused on the human aspect of life, its existence and it's sustainability and not as much on total equality of rights (many MRA's do not view as much of a fundamental human rights thing as I do.)
1364	  Why does it say I am a male?!?!  I can't believe that I made that mistake again, I feel awful! I truly didn't mean to imply that females are people. I have an opinion too, but I wouldn't say that it is unconstitutional that children grow up with the belief that everyone else is a philanderer. I also am not sure that I agree with the idea that men are all sociopaths.
1365	 To test a voter's knowledge of a bill we should give them several multiple choice questions that test their understanding of the bill. There should also be a test that asks them how long they would take to read the bill. This would give us a much better idea of how much background information the voter had before voting on the bill. We should also implement a way to prevent a person from accidentally voting more than once.
1366	 Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.   -EDIT-  I would also say that this would be an 'open book' test; the bill would literally be in front of them.
1367	  Certain questions would be selected, including general questions like: what is the first section, and what is the last? general political questions like: what country is the government similar to? questions about features of the bill and sections of the bill: what laws have been passed in the past? which sections of the bill do you consider the most important ones? what are the crucial laws that you think we need?
1368	 If the bill is to be changed at all, research should be done on how the bill could be improved or updated to not go against the values or convictions of the voters. Research could be done with voters who are more knowledgeable about the bill, and with voters who are less knowledgeable, based on the research. The reason for this is that voters should know how to vote in the best way, and such research could ensure that they don't vote for the wrong reasons.
1369	A description of a proposed solution. But it is obvious that proper thorough education would be required to perform well on this test, and I'm trying to get the people to think about how the money allocated to raise their children could be better spent. According to the author, his new approach would establish the importance of education as a crucial factor in educational assessment. 3. introduce new tests in which students receive fewer educational privileges

It can manipulate people to take actions they wouldn't take otherwise, people get in conflicts because of their religion,  religion undermines science and cause problems. Also religion is everywhere. Not only in religious places, but in school, in coffee shops, in the media, in politics. religion caused all the problems we see today. religion has been manipulated to make it look good to people, so they believe that if they believe their religion (even if that religion is completely wrong) that they will be on the right track. religion leads people to do unethical things and even lies. religion leads to controlling and biasing people to believe something that causes harm. religion does not come from the heart, it is something that is put on. religion can be good, like bringing people together and praying for each other, but not be good if people believe in something that is completely wrong that makes them do things that are dangerous, like suicide bombers, suppression of logical thought, imprisonment for pleasing a superior, religious warfare, abortion, alcohol or drugs, etc. religion can be good, like bringing people together and praying for each other, but can also be bad if people believe in something that is completely wrong that makes them do things that are dangerous, like suicide bombers, suppression of logical thought, imprisonment for pleasing a superior, religious warfare, abortion, alcohol or drugs, etc. religion can be good, like bringing people

This program isn't scientific, but it is my opinion.  ### Comment: -steven When you are wrong your opinion does not negate the general theory, just because some people are more knowledgeable than you doesn't make them right, and you are doing a good job of debunking it. Thanks! None of this is scientific, its just my opinion! much more accurate information in their news report. There is no "denialists" and "pro" camps any more, everyone has been over-stated by the media. Warmers are just environmentalists who want to profit from the situation.
1381	 I understand and agree with Martin's explanation. I will never look at climate change from the perspective of some environmentalists and others that want to use it for political gain or have an agenda that doesn't support science.   I have friends that study the climate, and I know for a fact that some may be susceptible to climate change theories, but not to the extent that the majority. Therefore, I highly doubt that the climate change theories are all false.   Finally, we can agree that many people are too afraid to speak up against their beliefs, and the entire climate change agenda is way bigger than just the scientific side of it.
1382	I found nothing particularly logical in his arguments, and I do not agree with him in all his opinions on climate science, but I found his arguments to be rather predictable, and I believe he would benefit from some clarification. He is overly provocative with his skewed opinions on climate science. he has also stated that he did not do research on climate science, though he is an expert on environmental studies and he is known for advocating fossil fuel policies. I suspect that he is attempting to monetize his web presence with a view to attracting clicks.  ### Modify: Argument #1 - In 2008, few technological advances were made with regards to climate change.

1385	longer - easier - riskier life... easier - shorter - riskier life... riskier - longer life... The current situations means that the world population is exploding with the killing statistics of people and environmental destruction. World population has leveled off but will be rapidly increasing as well as dangerous problems without there being a radical and drastic change.  What if anyone find medicine to end all suffering which means increasing the world population
1386	  After their deaths. Who is more likely to be left to live longer after they die: the person who has prolonged their life through a medical intervention that removes them from pain or misery, or the person who has lived a long and relatively normal life and is now taken from their family and friends who live for a fraction of their own length of life?
1387	Medical advances will alleviate suffering.  Medical advances will increase the world population significantly. Malaria Vaccine dramatically reduces illness and death and will cure many patients in the coming years, but this is mostly likely in the next 5 years to 10 years. More people will live longer. Then in the 30-40 years ahead most people in the developed world will die very quickly. So some people will agree this is a good thing, because with fewer diseases, less people will die but many people will not agree because the world will become much more crowded.
1388	Many people think about how much more people will inhere on the earth, and that always concern me. How do we balance the needs of population growth against other issues?

People will live longer and will therefore need greater health care support. More money to pay for proper medical care will push up prices. If medical care is expensive the poor will not get proper care. In the end they will die faster and suffer more. My environment and health habits are ways I can protect myself and my family.
1390	No, hardly, actually. I couldn't figure it out either until the game started, but the complaints about the controls and matches have been more of a reason to play the game because you can usually get away with leaving your controls alone, and finding new activities to do around dungeon levels. Really, you could probably be done with the game in 90 minutes after getting started. I didn't realize how terrible the controls were, so here's another way to look at it: I actually couldn't play half of the levels because the controls made it impossible to make any progress. If you had to constantly tweak your controls and chances of death are constantly on your mind, it wouldn't be worth the trouble.

1394	Yes, I wouldn't call it bad at all, and TLOU can certainly be recommended as a game, but I can only recommend a few games instead of playing TLOU.  TLOU requires you to play the demo only to get the full experience before you can enjoy the game properly.  I wouldn't recommend a game without before playing it, but only a few games require a demo to fully understand the experience, games like Knack, The Last Story, and and Origins.

Israel is often heavily politicized.  We can defend the establishment of Israel if it will protect Jewish heritage from around the world. But that's why we have minorities.

I'm really glad I live in the land of the free @sotdryonkat Or I would be banned from asking questions about the truth on reddit as well # XXXXXX needed comment_review(args) == True print("The review has been saved.")

1425	Transgendered people want societal acceptance. Society and government do not accept those with very different gender identities for some time and it is something a lot of people hate. As transgendered people want to make an impact, they co-opt the gay movement. They are too selfish, they are not thinking about the bigger picture, and they are not responsible. Lack of societal acceptance can also affect a lot of different lifestyles for the transgendered community, and may result in a very dangerous situation where someone kills themselves. As a result, some transgendered people may resort to acting out. However, transgendered people do not form a large portion of the LGBT population.  Will not happen
1426	transgender people should not be fighting for rights. transgendered people are not mentioned in international human rights. transgendered people are not mentioned in domestic legal rights. it is not a new rights. For the transgendered movement to be a thing, transgendered people needed to have already been mentioned as it relates to their human rights. transgendered people are not worthy of rights because of a lack of concrete facts about their rights. transgendered people are not worthy of rights because transgendered persons are not mentioned in international human rights and domestic legal rights. transgendered people are not worthy of rights because transgendered people have not had an actual cause for their exclusion. transgendered people need to hear about their existence from the State or the fact that transgendered people have already fought to be mentioned. transgendered people need to fight for rights. transgendered people need to be mentioned in international human rights and domestic legal rights. transgendered people need to be mentioned
1427	I would argue that the LGBT movement can rally unity, but for serious action, it is important to distinguish that LGBT is a group of people who suffer discrimination for their sexuality, not gender identity. LGBT and transgendered are to different groups within each gender identity so each should push for equal rights within their movements. LGBT, as people who deal with discrimination, have something to gain from being on the same platform.  LGBT is a term used to refer to homosexuality, bisexuality, transgendered, and heterosexuality. The transgendered, or Gender, Dysphoria, are people with specific issues within certain genders which become more pronounced upon entering puberty. LGBT is a particularly difficult group of people to sympathize with. If you say that LGBT is a term used to refer to homosexuality, bisexuality, transgendered, and heterosexuality, they will not be as offended, as they might have been with plain 'gay'. As they may not be conscious of the true meaning behind the term LGB
1428	One should wait a few years until they are ready to get married and have their civil rights. There is a process to obtaining this right and they are not a group worth fighting for. Instead, it is bad enough that the right to be a member of the LGBT community is devalued. They should not be lumped into this other group. people (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, question their sexuality, or tend to view their sexuality as nothing more than a race) who have sexual preferences that they believe do not match those of the "traditional" heterosexual.
1429	I would like to fight for their rights to be included within the LGBT movement and acknowledge that transgendered people are important, legitimate and important allies in that fight. There is also power in fighting for equality for all people. LGBT is an acronym used to describe several groups that are allies in equal rights fights including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered and intersex (LGBTQI + ). I support the LGBT movement because it is a movement used to give equal rights to everybody, including transgendered people.
1430	May be it is time to change my view. That may be what is needed. No. Make changes only to clarify this, did you?  Yes. I think I am making an improvement. No. Change only to clarify this, did you?  Yes. I think I am making an improvement. No
1431	 I'm interested in learning the math behind this big picture, and may discuss it with my university professors to see what they think, but right now I don't have a lot of time or money to further investigate this, and would rather enjoy my life now. Mediocre effort - not to devalue the original assignment
1432	  "I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree."   "My stance is that celebrating or being present during these milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree."
1433	  More celebrating -- less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies. less graduation ceremonies.
1434	 Most graduates celebrate their education with the graduates, parents, family, friends, teachers. While we all support the celebration, however I would like to also push to make this one amazing day for the individual, at a first graduation, I do not know what the difference in personally celebrating a person's accomplishments is. The goal is to celebrate a person's achievements, and most will not have so much anxiety or fear that they feel that celebrating this with all their family and friends is pushing to the limit.
1435	How many people were there at Mount Sinai? Over a million. Calculation: 600,000/600,000 = 11.1. Figures: The number of people who left Egypt on the Ark was 1,000. So there were 1 million people who were on the ark. To get that number to 10 people would require the occurance of exactly 10 luck of the draw.
1436	Judaism is more likely to be true even if you have evidence to the contrary because it's implausible to believe that all the ancestors are gathered there. It's also more believable that there are millions of people who leave to go follow God than 600,000. Christianity is less believable because the leap of faith they make is smaller. Islam is less likely to be true because the assumption that all the ancestors were gathered is a huge leap of faith.
1437	 Hasidic Judaism is most believable, because religious belief is always hard to get, and thus, stories must be believable.[consider the following replies as an example: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
1438	religion is a series of ideas and beliefs that you believe and is followed by followers. Judaism, Islam and Christianity are all religions. It is followed by followers and believes in a certain set of rules, but it's following that indicates the difference between each of the religions. In Judaism, a person will write their beliefs down and have them read to them in front of their community. Each generation that follows will be taught from the previous generation, such that the beliefs will not change.
1439	Islam is clearly less believable than Judaism because Islam requires there to be conversion to become muslim, and the conversion proof for Islam relies on the Exodus and the apparently mythical account of the covenant of the Mount Sinai. Christianity is clearly less believable, because it relies on an account of the founder being resurrected. Christianity also relies on the unreliable account of the resurrection of the Apostle James and the claim of a sort of glory day which consists of the resurrection of ALL humans. Christianity was a religion that spread across the world, by converting humans for the concept of one heaven.
1440	 However, I do agree that if you are already drunk the situation may not be overly within your control. But unless you consent, and actively look away, which is what my case was, you will always be considered to have consented and therefore shouldn't be considered a victim to have been raped. I also want to know arguments for her side.

1442	 Yes, I expected alcohol to make a person less capable of understanding. And yes, the first party had completely consented to be drunk. Whether alcohol affects all sexual decisions equally is unclear, but these two propositions serve as guidelines.     Because of his or her state of intoxication, the person making the request does not count toward evidence supporting the claim that he or she may have claimed rape.

1450	It depends what type of vacation you get. I'm thinking specifically about a fishing vacation in Hawaii. Then I would think $70,000 is enough for me. I'll happily have $30,000 over for fishing vacations. I have to admit, this doesn't make sense. The evidence shows that people get around 60 hours of vacation per year. Some people get about 100 hours. By the time they've got over a thousand hours of vacation, they're probably ready to retire.
1451	very few people will actually earn more than $70,000 a year a fair wage  Now, let's go over the following sentence to re-write it (this isn't a small change): ### Why will the majority not earn more than $70,000 a year? In short, you're far more likely to do this in the real world.
1452	That would depend on you. Some people would consider that to be a miracle. What's the point of a miracle? Another change that makes the answer better is to make a sentence that makes no sense. For example,   ### Other response: Imagine you have children, even poor children. Imagine you're cooking and washing dishes. Imagine being overworked and always on your feet. Instead of having a vacation, what you would want to do is be able to make it all good by finishing the dishes as quickly as possible, not slow down your cleaning, never let the kids out of the house.
1453	When you have a child, the extra $70k really isn't worth it. With that money, you can afford a nice house and not worry about transportation/expenses/commodities. You can afford a 30 grand home in the city. You wouldn't have to worry about what to eat. You couldn't afford a vacation that much if you had a 30 grand home and not enough money for groceries.
1454	 This may help; could you be wrong though: Income differences are best addressed as an issue of buying power. Income differences should, at most, be seen as financial options for you to make choices on. Use whatever data you'd like; in general, people tend to pay for the luxuries that they have access to as opposed to things they haven't.
1455	No, it doesn't. Correct? Yes, it would be. No, not. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. Yes
1456	Yes  Hawley Williams is a student at the University of Las Vegas. "Hawley wants to know whether anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?"
1457	No artificial intelligence creates something intelligent, but something intelligent creates artificial intelligence. Yes, artificial intelligence can make claims about artificial intelligence, but they cannot make claims about something that is not artificial intelligence themselves...No artificial intelligence creates something intelligent, but something intelligent creates artificial intelligence. Yes, artificial intelligence can make claims about artificial intelligence, but they cannot make claims about something that is not artificial intelligence themselves
1458	No. We don't need to love artificial creation. It is actually enough to love our loved ones who aren't artificially created. The gospel should only teach us to give love to those who are created by us. We have separate beliefs about those who are artificially created beings. We see them as imitating us, but we should not love those who imitate us

The total which remains after paying all the existing countains is potentially tha Ricanen in the account. So if tno the money stays put here for nothing
1461	 Rich people come from dishonest backgrounds. Their money is clean, but they want to steal it. That could be why their money was in prison. They are unscrupulous about stealing it from the poor. In this case, I would recommend you give it to the poor rather than just steal it yourself. Otherwise, give the money to the poor to make sure they won't be stole in the future.
1462	rich people should be prosecuted, imprisoned and if possible deported to Albania. and of course even more should pay back the money that they stole. A phenomenal amount of money has been earned by some of the richest people in Albania in the last several months. A phenomenal amount of money has been lost by working illegal alien 'aliens. I hate to see people lose money. That's probably one reason I don't like Wally Mart.
1463	I would hardly give a poor man who works and goes to school to keep on working there to keep on graduating college and getting a good job.  Poor people should not do well in the work force, and therefor the reasons are as the other says. I think both the rich and the poor need to get involved as well...the government should increase its efforts to make sure the rich get into some form of real criminal justice system and the poor get more of their basic need met. The two needs are, thus, intertwined, because I think it's irresponsible and not fair for the rich people to be evading taxes, not making the country run, and then be able to survive and rise and screw the poor.
1464	We should, if we're going to make appropriate changes to the world, continue to change the world. Let us direct this money instead toward building better streets, roads, schools, community centers, public transportation, health care, libraries, parks and other public amenities for people who would truly need it. We must offer a better world to our grandchildren. We need to find a better alternative to shop at Wal-Mart or Target or elsewhere...
1465	 Let me create an analogy.  Imagine a person who does not follow the teachings of Jesus. Imagine this person remains unconcerned about everyone else's bad behavior around them.   Because the nature of this man is not to keep up with the teachings of Jesus, he is doing nothing about it.  A person that thinks that his beliefs are the only one that matters, and that he is the only one that is correct, makes it very difficult to be good and nice towards people with completely different beliefs.  So this person, despite his hidden flaws and irrationality, can have a good reputation in the world.
1466	1/God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), does not 2. Anyone who knows that evil can be stopped, but does nothing is flawed on some level3. This is contradictory to letter A4. Therefore, God doesn't exist. 6.3()   QNAMR(GOD) = "God sees evil in the world, but he does not.  He's perfect!"
1467	A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D A or B C and D
1468	The first two points above are the only two workable options. God is a perfect being. that exists. He has power. He sees evil in the world and takes action to stop it. The only possibilities remain are that this is contradictory to his perfect will and his doing wrong with power. God does not exist, because there is no such thing as a perfect being.
1469	### Argument: #Change all caps words to lower case, then put all caps words inside single quotes: ### Warning: ### If you are tempted to write, "Oh, my god," at the end of your response, remember he that cannot forgive ### himself cannot have a place in his (God's) presence FLAWFUL. HE WORSHIPED GOD.
1470	 time rowing time running, based on your reading ability and personal experience, what do you think might be right about distance versus time? time rowing time running distance time running distance rowing time running time running distance time running distance rowing time running
1471	 Rowing is more intense and the legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.
1472	 Rowing is more involved than running, but more fast- paced than swimming, especially for distance. Rowing can be mentally exhausting, so you'll need a lot of stamina, if you're to do this type of workout.
1473	 # PROBLEM  Rowing may be better for a person who is more oriented to distance, and runners may be better for one who is a distance oriented swimmer. Rowing should be done as a distance oriented sport.

1475	You may consider focusing more on aspects of environmentalism that don't lead to global warming rather than ones that do. Apply environmentalism with care to prevent changes from global warming. Abide by it. Think a great deal about environmentalism, and explore new ways of interacting with the earth and all other living things. Discuss. CONFRONT. Are there aspects of environmentalism that contradict the fossil record that might have lead to the increase in global temperature? No, as they could have.
1476	examples like those have driven the environmental movement so far away from its original purpose. In my opinion, it is best to have respectful debates, where people present good evidence and counter-evidence for their position, rather than degrading the views of others. I think we should also use those debates to appreciate the importance of our planet and what we do, to preserve it. Some good points I will think about when I go to support environmental causes is if people cut down more trees, as this will eventually adversely affect the earth, what will people who live in the future do? Think carefully.
1477	I think environmentalism can be a good thing, but it should be fun, not strict, imposed, and depressing. Question: Why does the writer do not agree with the radical environmentalists? Answer not in context for this task. they are strictly controlling aspects of life in their efforts to stop climate change. they believe global warming is caused by the sun. since there is overwhelming scientific evidence to support that belief, they see the radicals as a bunch of heretics who do not believe in it.
1478	Hebrews 9:12-19    "You once were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk in the light as He has commanded you, that you may prove what your practice leads to.

They also believe that certain unconventionally shaped plants in certain areas of the world that should not exist due to the changing global climate. Global warming appears to be the main issue that they believe is attributing to the serious problems that our environment is currently facing. They also believe that we are attempting to fool the public by creating new ones that they claim lead to the changes that should never have taken place in the first place.
1480	 The person could be just out to catch your eye Bill O'Reilly has an opinion. Sometimes his opinion seems moderately justified, sometimes not. Similarly, someone like Keith Olberman also has opinions which are sometimes moderately justified and sometimes not. Each can wield structured argumentation, and each will occasionally stoop to more base forms of persuasion. It's all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.

1482	His take on the construction of such a vile phrase became hazy as he could no longer answer effectively.  Philanthropy is good but not everything. Taking into account the origins of the word and what we know about the Old Testament it is best to err on the side of not being excessively generous, perhaps largely for a practical reason.

1484	It is all simply guilty until proven innocent until you prove that they are guilty. Any opinions are just con-sequences of gritting your teeth and dipping your toe in water.  Suggestion: The most persuasive argument is something as simple as an evangelical Christian saying that everyone who accepts the Bible as divine should die, instantaneously and without trial.
1485	 I agree with that Academic qualification ensures success in life because Academic qualifications ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is strong, you can get success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.

1491	 We can find the best thing about this recession is a better way of working together as a community. It allows companies to grow their profits, save and reinvest in their community. The small business rebounding, bad jobs and increase prices are temporary if we work smart together as a community.
1492	A recession isnt ALWAYS a bad thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that all of the corporate world fat is being trimmed and weeded out, leaving only the best and most sufficient companies. The short term job losses and price increases are definately a bad thing but they are only temporary. THe US has gotten out of worse before (Late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression) just to name a few.

1495	 Energy is sustainable as long as we continue using it in areas such as power production, plant construction and maintaining renewable energy like solar and wind. To keep energy supply in place energy usage should be reduced. There is too much of energy and too much energy use, but only the gkauge of industrial and nuclear power plants can be reduced without greater expense.
1496	 It will not be long until the government takes action and starts enacting regulations based on this report. This is highly likely to be a huge success. If this resolution is passed the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies will be prevented from bringing on another crisis.
1497	 The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies in 2008. The irresponsible actions they took led to the collapse of the economy when prices of oil and other commodities rose significantly which affected many more countries with high debt, falling

1499	 The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after WW2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists devolping solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building hiways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuel while destroying the envoirment

1505	 Monarchies are just burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchy because they don't have they original role - ruling. There are many of examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizen. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pound per year.
1506	 impact = 45000000 result=-20+impact answer="The effects of being a burden are mathematically: " +str(result)+" " + " pounds per year in savings per monarchy." #print answer
1507	Trying to reform Scottish monarchy to make it better is extremely hard because Scottish politics is much more interesting than UK politics. Scottish politics has these much more significant development since 1998.  The Scottish referendum on independence was delayed for a full year due to financial reasons so Scottish politics didn't change significantly. I would say this happens with other referenda, but Scotland is an extremely difficult country and isn't going to change relatively quickly.
1508	No, monarchies are not just burdens, they can have a real and positive role if they're in a republican system. The monarch can help to rule the country and boost economic growth, just like republican monarchs can. In addition to this, republican monarchs can rule for longer periods of time.
1509	 If monarchy is based on House of Great Britain, ruled by King, means real king, does have real power and the real political influence. Therefore a monarchy is healthy for the economy as a rule.

Proof of this: Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.

1516	Nothing exists; You put things into nothing. Nothing is a shorthand phrase for non-existing things. To assert that no thing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists.
1517	No response available.  Neither existential arguments nor simple logical arguments would appear to qualify in the process. Would you agree? No response available. Yes  No answer possible No answer possible
1518	"Nothing exists." To argue that nothing exists is a logical impossibility. Nothing exists when it actually does!  "The sake of argument" occurs where a defendant has admitted to committing a crime. Now, added: The answer!
1519	Nothing exists." To utter that sentence - or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist.
1520	 Yes, thank you for this insightful response and taking the time to explain things and also offering insights on this issue. Our answer will be that the Phelps Clan was not at all protecting their first amendment right but instead violate that right by singling out a person in a funeral to endorse homosexuality. They took more liberty to take a stand on homosexuality instead of live in a harmony without associating with same sex clubs.
1521	 The first amendment protects freedom of assembly. This is true, but also protects freedom of speech. Freedom of speech does not protect breaking the law, or stating false statements. What is protected is stating your feelings through speech. "Semper Fi fag" was quoted correctly and therefore protecting speech is not ruled out.
1522	The phrase "specific policy" is used in legal cases to make stronger arguments of who is really protected under the first amendment. The term "specific policy" means that the policy is strictly meant towards a group and does not apply to any other group. "Gay" cannot be considered a policy against, or a restricted group like what they have done.
1523	Therefore: I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected under the first amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one persons funeral. At that point it's almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Now, had they been somewhere else and been stating their beliefs against all military members or gay people then they would have been fine.
1524	 I'm not very happy with how I came up with this wording. I think the comments made are deservedly deserved hatred and they should not be protected under the first amendment, so I would say the first amendment does not apply to this case. Remarks should be rated no access
1525	her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics. In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." The article cause quite a bit of controversy, this has to be one of the meanest things she has ever said. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense some times, but you can clearly tell that she is making fun of mentally disabled people here. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it's one of the worst things she has ever said...
1526	You are free to do whatever you want to do about it, but let me ask you a few questions that may help you out. Who is the special olympics team? Who is actually disabled? Who is the Special Olympics leader? Why does ANN write a bad article? What does Ann want you to think? Give your best answer regarding their article. How would you say it...? ANN is a loser who needs his aunt (non-Disability) to be more difficult for him to get along with.
1527	Yes she made sense some of the time but I think that she would need to be put away for the rest of the day. It is so mean and insulting in nature that she needs to be put away for a day. When trying to be funny it needs to be done to all the right people.
1528	It was her first time golfing, so she didn't know what to do. Assumedly. Even so, as one commenter has pointed out, mentally disabled people can easily get some useful skills out of golf. I'm not sure Ann was joking about the Special Olympics but I can tell that many people are not familiar with the actual significance of playing golf. There are some touching points. I think all people need to be compassionate and give everyone a break.  I agree with the last commenter.
1529	Ann is upset she made fun of the Special Olympics. Her words are offensive, please revise the argument. Ann is upset that she made fun of the Special Olympics.

1531	It may have been by natural causes. I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have offed him WAY before when he was actually inventing things which could possibly be related to weapons
1532	 Obviously he was a horrible man who left a legacy of a lot of bad. Basically he was evil. He was also a source of growth and thus worth living for; he's better than Joker or similares.

They are the best tacos I've ever had! That being said, I tend to eat a lot and I've tried some pretty good taco places before but they're way too creamy. Now, the tacos you gave me are crisp and completely chunky! You took my breath away. To sum up, I'm satisfied!
1538	The tacos were actually good enough that I ate both. Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now. They're great! However, nothing stopped me from taking a picture. Sorry!

1546	No, not really. They are not providing us with a lot of imaginative, creative dishes.

1575	Yes, Firefox. It's a lot better than IE, which has terrible security.  No, IE. It has more security, but it's still not a good browser.  Yes, Firefox. I would prefer Firefox over IE
1576	Everything from speed to add-ons, IE wins. Updated:  ### Argument: Whatever was good about the web should make for a winner.
1577	Firefox isn't getting rid of Windows pre-installed. They are just threatening to get rid of IE and force their users to upgrade.
1578	The unannounced return of IE after five years will impact everyone from web developers to website users, from online businesses to consumers. Considering all aspects, I'd say it's much better to use Firefox.
1579	No thanks, I mean... The speedy response I gave you doesn't really get the idea across. Firefox wins by wide margins.
1580	Its better to use E. clean and open.. Firefox is old now, just because of IE's backwards security patches. still good with E6 and E7.
1581	 is an old browser. the Firefox overcame IE when IE 8 was released. Next to IE, Google Chrome is the best browser.  Cassandra Scanlon contributed to this answer
1582	 Mozilla Firefox can't be used for everything! It's installed on the majority of operating systems and the number of users is much higher. a new competition would be detrimental for mozilla.
1583	Open your web browser and go to www.savannah.edu. You need to be a professor or employee to view this website.
1584	 Firefox 3.x can do everything! There are also plugins so that you can use the internet explorer engine in the firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a nice feature. all of the innovations in E 7.0 were in firefox years ago.
1585	 Make the original point of view clearer? No.. you might as well just confess and save yourself a problem. Clearly I wouldn't love my husband if I turned him in for murder. My love would make me do the right thing, not the opposite.
1586	 From here, the speaker puts a greater emphasis on the partner and her own judgment of their circumstances and begin to show sympathetic affect for their spouse. If my husband committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that in love we should be by your partner throught the thick and thin no matter what. I wouldn't want my husband to be in jail because the laws were not
1587	 I don't know if my husband committed murder but since murder happened I am against criminalizing it. Criminalizing drug use is another thing that shouldn't happen. I only know that things happen to everyone. I also understand that there are people that commit crimes with reason.
1588	 Many people make mistakes throughout their life. Yes, this would be wrong for someone who would commit murder to be at a jail. I love my husband. No matter what.
1589	 I should be by them throught thick and thin no matter what. I love them and I feel that in love we should be by your partner and that I would never turn them in.
1590	 Seriously maybe if she took me to court and then got a Divorce she would relent but I would not give in without her fighting me and the truth is she is a slut anyway and it's my right to ignore her as the Real Husband that got her pregnant and could drop her like a bad habit if she moved in to my house and did not get pregnant
1591	 I would want him to fall in love with me because I want him to be mine he does not know what he has, be my spouse.. but he wont. so basically, if he loved me, he'd ask me.
1592	 No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
1593	You will decide to turn in your spouse if you decided to have a family. If not, you would wait to have children. You want to wait to become a family and will probably wait until you are very old.
1594	 No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
1595	 Uh huh, I guess. This is an interesting question. Maybe some day I will have to find out if my spouse is capable of murder.
1596	 It is probably his hot wife. Because love is most likely in the act. He would always do better for her than her husband.   Need more work...
1597	 Yes, I think I would turn them in on a cold day. Maybe someday. No, maybe not
1598	 I love my husband more than anything in the world. Yes I would turn them in, even if it was cold blooded murder.
1599	I will turn my spouse in more than likely, if it was just murder. no responses on this question.
1600	 I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. I do not completely agree with TV as it is very bad in large amounts but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people
1601	 I believe books are better, you can find out more about books here https://books.google.com/?id=1JGlquZUtbRwZgKkoC3WYwamp7I5mRElc&printsec=frontcover and www.education.com/What-Is-better-TV-Books
1602	 TV can be a good help to some children. However if your children watch TV more than 2 hours per day, then you should let them listen to English radio for a half hour. Your children may learn some English language vocabulary or grammar and form new habits that may help them increase their future vocabulary. B0510TVBad.htm
1603	 I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning.

1614	Still struggling with the Khan :( ...as well as other stupid nonsense we do in the country! xD
1615	 Actually, i think that the path to their economic growth is already planned. the gdp of india will increase in the next 5 years....... they just have to have enough fund to stabilize themself and make the poorer citizens have a good living environment
1616	how can we even imagine them to lead the world.......more than around the block these poor guys can just kill each other..there seems no way they can do it......my brother is unemployed right now and its pretty much dogging his life...
1617	Indians are unscrupulous and lazy by nature. i can tell you that to a man here in India, gdp mattered little......
1618	hi i have a national interest in this matter i sincerely hope and wish to help lead the world.........just look at indians.....who rely so much on indian flag..... who even know hindi langugage.... who even know their previous past for its sake...
1619	4 and almost 100% loss if wrong justification were given....

1620	 This is better: being a man without an active father may set you the bad example. So I believe in my opinion if you are a man without an active father, I believe that would be better you choosing to be such a man. And that just needs to be known to anyone.
1621	things can really get better if you just rely on yourself and everyone else in your life. dont leave something to chance like as a boy. keep trying because things can only get better and its only a matter of time before its going to happen. It can help you: rely more on yourself fix all your relationships with those that are around you Make you appreciate the life you have

1624	 By setting such a bad example what his father has taught him it may make him much worse than a better fatherless situation. Without doing good in his life his father is more likely to learn from his former example and take that onboard and learn how to be a better guy instead of his former self.
1625	 You haven't met with your father... and you don't know if he is alive or not. if your father is dead I suppose you should be upset with it. you know you are better off without a father. so you are being very smart in not getting married since that would require you to meet your father...
1626	 Currently the child is very unsatisfied by the father because he will not be around to see the child grow up and learn how to read or even spend time with him. The parents should simply separate and allow the child some free time. The father is simply not good enough for the child to please and encourages the child to instead grow up without him.
1627	I don't want to be fatherless, I want to have a father. I like the way people act. It is good to have a father. Why does it annoy me when there is no father to look to? I will never feel disappointed again! fatherless instead of having a lousy father.
1628	I don't agree, my father was a very lousy father. The last time I saw him was when he kicked me out of the house for missing a pottery class when I was thirteen, and I haven't heard from him since. He is not around to disappoint me. I don't think that to be fatherless is better. I agree that the last time I saw him he broke a leg and got hospitalized, but I was away because of a hockey tournament and it ended up not working out very well. I still want to live with my mother
1629	 I myself haven't had any fatherly guidance, so wouldnt mind not having any father. # Marks based on your feedback: 1.1 2.2 2.1 2.2 3.2 3.1 2.5 2.4 4.2 4.3 3.2 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.2 4.2 4.1 4.1
1630	I think that people need to be reminded about the family unit every single day, in order to keep it stable. This needs to be from my childhood years up until later in life when I can take care of myself without a crappy father who is too soft to stand up and tell me what to do, making me have no real life. I do not like lousy fathers who are too soft to stand up and tell their sons what to do.
1631	 I want my mom to be more financially stable and should tell my dad what to do with his life more often in an effort to get him to do more with his life.
1632	 Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table. ###
1633	And may God bless her. Also most fathers just get mad if their daughter gets pregnant. They have no respect or love for her. May God bless her. Raising the baby will be difficult.
1634	I would be happy and would have nothing to complain about if I got to raise my own son. However, I hope he can find a father who will constantly be encouraging him throughout his life rather than a father who is mad at him all the time to make his life impossible to live.
1635	I'm not quite sure what he did to benefit the Chinese and Malays because there was a lot of struggle.  Change from: he did a lot for people Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions
1636	Farquhar is not to be admired for his actions. He only wanted to gain power while doing the least in return for his work
1637	You might have thought that he is an honorable person after reading his actions.  Farquhar was also a leader who helped rejuvenate the region.
1638	He would receive this message: They revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
1639	Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions. blah. around. that...
1640	Exercise: What is lust? lust, after long study by the author (longer than usual), was best described as: As the desire for sexual intercourse. For the sake of this answer, the author believes that lustiness is fairly common and generally accepted as good.    ### Edit:  Porn is wrong because you are being lustful.
1641	 First things first, don't be lustful, not only for Porn's sake. Second, not even for any of your motives. You have plenty of time to learn to better yourself in these ways. You don't have to hook up with anyone and you shouldn't just stay alone with a bunch of guys. There are different ways to live the Christian life. And you should look for ways to spread grace to others around you. But that's fine because they're both wrong. Don't hook up, and don't look at another people in a preverted way, either, at all, so you don't
1642	It is wrong. The spouses who cheat on each other are breaking the bedrock foundation of marriage, which they do because they want to see things from a different perspective. These spouses are not good examples. Although all of us have been lustful before, none of us should be.
1643	While porn can be unsavory and lustful, it shouldn't be the worst thing in the world. It is not all bad, it's not even good. If you get into lustful pursuits, for whatever reason, then please stop. Sex is a valid expression of love between two people, the Bible prohibits non-marital sex, and it is a way that we pray for unity within the body of Christ.
1644	I'm okay with my decision to support my wife in the way I can. That's enough for me and that's a good thing. We've been married since high school, so that's a long time.

1742	 That will help someone out or even just like finding something fun in the book on an old laptop.   Another challenge I need to face is coding
1743	What I do would be awesome, but I have to choose which would be more helpful. Help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
1744	 I'd prefer to help others in any way I can, and I know it makes a difference. Actually, I really hope my life makes a difference.  This is where it would be good to ask: How do you make a difference?  Gi·ªõi thi·ªáu v·ªÅ ch·ªß ƒë·ªÅ: N·∫øu b·∫°n v·ª´a m·ªõi t√¨m th·∫•y, h√£y tham kh·∫£o c√°c ph·∫ßn quan tr·ªçng sau:
1745	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's easy to manage the school so the students can study and we don't have to worry about choosing clothes. Second it's also good to know who is studying in which school or what time school is.  Students come to school when they are in uniform so we won't need a long time to collect all the students
1746	I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
1747	What? These costumes are too low quality. I say that school uniforms are a good idea. It makes students look nice, tidy, and it's convenient because we don't have to spend time to chose clothes. Otherwise I would buy myself some school uniforms. Yes

1750	I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
1751	 The father might be horrible to you, but he still loves you anyway and always wants what's best for you. however, not everyone likes him. he doesn't do anything. be the best you can, and not fall behind in school, so when you have a horrible father, he will thank you for all you do for him.
1752	I rather have a father that is not perfect than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a father who is not perfect would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess father who is not perfect would like to know of their child
1753	 I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible
1754	 I rather have a bad father than not have a father at all. good father is very generous with his money. good father always buy you everything for a child who has everything! bad father is too generous. bad father is not a true father.
1755	I have a father, he is great, for I didn't live without a father, he died when I was five.
1756	Fatherless...lousy Father(s) that is needed. Fatherless is better to me than not having a Father,
1757	I think it is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.  ### End
1758	We don't know. We don't know if having a kid makes one a better person or worse. Maybe the best thing is to just be okay with being a parent for yourself. We don't know for sure.
1759	Being Fatherless does not leave you feeling empty. It leaves you feeling lonely because you didn't had Father, you didn't know how it would be, that is the first feeling, after being Fatherless, it is an isolating feeling because you didn't have the other Father's mindset, friends and relationship.
1760	 If they didn't have a father, you would have to find some other, like your grandparents, aunt, uncle or other relatives. You would have to spend your time with them, and they may not share the same values as you do, and they could make you feel uncomfortable.
1761	 It's better for a man to have a good father than no father because your father always is there to help you. Even if you have a bad father you always have someone to confide in.
1762	If my father were still alive i'd say i'd be a really well balanced person. I'd always look to my father for help when i need it. And i'd say to him things that i really need to say.
1763	If your father is in charge, well you know what can do wrong on the wrong day. If your father says you must do a particular thing then, you know, you do it. You can't really say what is wrong but if you ask him, he says it isn't, that that's not the problem.  that means they are probably worried about their father.
1764	Fatherless is better because I don't have to tell you my problems. :) I don't know if the first argument I wrote is clearer. That is mostly because of the inclusion of the preceding sentence.
1765	 I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him
1766	Having a father isn't a single person, but a family unit. Having a father shouldn't be about family so much as it should be about honor and appreciation. Having a father is a way of doing the right thing. Having a father should be all about what he can do for you and all that he is for you.
1767	 I would have to pick having a lousy father than not having a father at all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. (It may not help but at least you tried.) I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
1768	 A boy without a father and his father will attempt to figure it out how to make him laugh and ignore the points when he gets mad at him. It seems to me that the most important part of father figure is the availability to help in times of trouble, and the ability to figure out how to make you laugh. Being able to figure out how to make you laugh is much more important than being able to help in a crisis and taking your time in trying to figure out an answer.
1769	Grow up, child! Learn to laugh at yourself instead of getting mad. Then you will also learn to help you in situations like this. It sounds like you had a good father, he did the best he could, he got you good advice, and there are always two sides to every story.
1770	 It should be better if your father were bad at something than not to have one at all. So it'd be better if your father were bad at something than not to have one at all.
1771	I am fatherless and, in spite of this, I'm not happy about it, but there's something I need to say. But don't be my father. There's no relation between you and me.
1772	You can also answer Lousy father is better than nothing Fatherless, there is no possibility of having a lousy father, so the best of both is possible.
1773	 Parentless ‚Äì My Life Will Always Be This Bad? My Life Will Always Be This Bad! If someone is bad at something, it means that there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be parentless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.
1774	Of course. Of course you have to have a good father. However, if someone is bad at something, it means that there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it.

1803	Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.

1830	How about not forcing religious persons to permit someone of their own religion who has gay sex with another Christian? That is the same thing, right? You are comparing apples to oranges. No. No, thank you. First off, do not believe everything you are told, secondly the income tax doesn't discriminate against gays, thirdly, what do you suggest the government take away from marriage?
1831	  Why don't we just get rid of all of the tax breaks and give them straight marriage? I have to have some other explanation of why this policy changes if you have a tax break in the eyes of the state. It's just, I don't see the point in it. Like I said, it's not good for them and if it could be a marriage, why, why would they?  Just not good for them.
1832	If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it.
1833	Take advantage of your freedom of religion. There are no taxes paid for incest, and as far as marriages go, nobody controls the marriage of any two people. That said, the government is a control of major. It allows many to seek advantages over others by using itself as such, and therefore it is also not without faults.
1834	No, you're not allowed to say that. I don't support it either, even though my church doesn't. There are tax incentives, if you look for them. But you also have to pay taxes. So you get a lot of things. Just because my religion doesn't support it doesn't make it OK.

For example, in the United States, there was a time in recent history when Muslims and Hindus were very opposed. Due to present day religious tensions between Muslims and Hindus, current "leading nations" would not have the time or resources needed to have this occur.

1851	 continuing the current century, Christianity is nowhere near the dominant religion, and shows little sign of regaining its place in our culture. Rather, it is falling into disfavor. Christianity will not become dominant, because it is an incredibly diverse belief system. That is bad. It stands in the way of people being open and honest. Christianity is not dominant because it is a concept that we are not ready to hold and trust.
1852	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity.

Legal aid would be an advantage.   Argument 2
1891	Don't ask the two of them to come in. Tell them to call me and let me talk to them. Don't ask them to come in. Tell them to call me and let me talk to them.
1892	 Why will I not be able to live with my family knowing that my spouse might have killed someone? We will live in poverty, I have four children and I have depended on my spouse for 30 plus years. I never in a million years would I have taken it this far.
1893	Marriage should never be considered as a reason to kill. That is a terrible thing to do to your family. You should never do that to anyone else, including yourself. Please consider raising the child or children with your spouse again.
1894	Yes, I wish something could be done about the injustice to this victim. I wish someone would step up and really punish the people who have committed such evil acts. I wish someone could be held accountable and people would realize this injustice.
1895	 murder - sem ku be ss sooo cool. all kotties are prettier, I bet there is ppl shooting the guns. heheh i gottta tell you, were i lived i guess i would like to kill something the just sign tattooed on my uoooooooo life. the judge would be nice they would love that. murder at gun point even tattooed on your wrist. lol
1896	 Twice a year we hang all the items of furniture around the room that the most rent which no longer house us. I find this so refreshing when we move into a new home.  ### Section:  Description
1897	 resp dup() must be rewritten to a function that converts between strings and iterables. Inspiration: https://codeforces.com/contest/1551/problem/B. It was a fun challenge and reading through the code for the season's premier made it even funnier!   # def dup(s):
1898	 The example I would look is someone you know, who commits a crime in life, but wasn't there to know it when it was happening. Perhaps this could be true for you or your child. Maybe it wasn't by accident. My advice would be for that person to do what is right.
1899	 Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself. ### Copy: the response.
1900	Yes, I am never for a murder and I never would support murder. # submit get-me-out-no-adamas 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
1901	no this is my first time interviewing people and i cant really tell if its a good or bad question haha yeah no this is my first time interviewing people and i cant really tell if its a good or bad question haha
1902	Yes I'm in favor of turning him in. Yes I'm in favor of turning him in. If a person is wrong do something about it. No I wouldn't want to be married to a murderer. Yes I'm in favor of turning him in.
1903	 Yes, my man would be a terrible person, no, my man would not be great and a murderer because love can be blind. Yes, my man would be a terrible person, no, my man would not be great and a murderer because love can be blind.
1904	Nooboni understands that the type of crime done by the spouse is probably going to decide if one would turn spouse or not. Nooboni will assume that spouses should never kill their partners, but this does not mean that one would definitely turn spouses who did die through the consequences of murder and self-defense.
1905	a woman can still have their baby while having unprotected sex. it is just that the state makes it illegal to abort by criminalising
1906	 # Arguments argument = 'You can only have sex with a person of the opposite gender of yourself. "You can't sue anyone for true or false statements" """This is just a more useful and understandable example. """ ...
1907	  #Minor change: #The abuse of power should also be banned #...See government propaganda #Violation of the law should result in imprisonment.    # [ ‡¶â‡¶ö‡¶ø‡ßé aussi √™tre interdit, je vous d√©fie de montrer un seul article dans une quelconque bible valide expliquant la l√©galisation du suicide et m√™me ce que ce mot veut dire.   ! # Les mains des abrutis qui ont
1908	  "It tells women what they can and can't do with their bodies." "it" and "not" are misspelled.
1909	 The government actually does NOT tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies  Obviously, it is not illegal to commit suicide  The government does not force a person to think and act how they do.
1910	Women shouldn't go around getting pregnant without the possiblity of having a choice. They should always be protected by a man who will stand up for them. No matter what, a woman has a choice and should be treated with respect. That is her choice and her body.
1911	 As part of its Constitution, country A refuses to forgive their mistakes, they encourage mothers to continue on with their plans, and punish the rapist. These problems in country A are a great deal! country A refuses to forgive mistakes they encourage mothers to continue with their plans
1912	women are more important than babies from rape Women are more important than babies born from rape. This is a reflection on today's society where babies seem to be treated more as something to be helped, saved, and cured instead of just treated as an innocent being.
1913	Fish Consumption Kids wasting away because they dont get enough fish consumption is one of the biggest issues and unfortunately is becoming a norm around the world. The environment needs to focus more on children and less of the BS that is clothing for profit or fashion and so forth.
1914	Pass    No 1. Women should always ask before giving birth to babies that they should not be. Mothers who get pregnant don't know why! There parents and the sibling are upset and they are wrong. They should realize they are a direct cause. The child doesn't have much of a choice it is a direct result of this selfishness. Parents should be accountable for their actions and teach their children life lessons. No
1915	we need a nation wide law against this kind of questionable behavior (name deleted)
1916	what we are dealing with is only if the person is pregnant with a dead child
1917	what we are dealing with is an illegal abortion if a woman decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
1918	probably illegal or morally unacceptable to abort a child after the fact abortion
1919	 what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child
1920	 while no education classes should be strictly mandatory  - especially not all 4 years of HS. maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
1921	 while yes liberal education would still be in college it shouldnt be required(specially not all 4 years of college). maybe just having liberal arts be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous liberal arts class. in lower grades, no it should not be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
1922	 while yes there are things that sports should still be for anyone even if it is after school. This is a great idea! no it should not be the case. if that is the case it means boys will overweight and also get bulimia/anorexia because they are forced to participate but that is very dangerous. Maybe only 3 years per term sports? no no
1923	 no education should be required in kindergarten and the first two years of elementary school unless there are some sub-classifications. I agree that there will be problems with some kids, such as weight gain and loss issues, but the problem is should not be their normal problem when we recommend studies at a younger age(normal for kids, probably younger and harder for adults
1924	 yes it should be mandatory in lower grades but it shouldnt be mandatory 4 yrs in a row in high school. physical education classes should be mandatory when a student is preparing for school and should be in high schools only as an elective class
1925	Bad for students who can't afford APs, and unfair for all kids who try to earn more than they have to
1926	AP class gets one extra credit point for playing varsity sports.
1927	However, that may not be the only option for those that aren't signed up with a sports team. I would love to hear from you if you have any questions about the proposed solution.
1928	This would be very embarrassing for a PE class to take.
1929	Question: Why would going to college for football be difficult? They worry about scholarship money
1930	Gay marriage should be allowed, it is a personal choice and so is its benefits.  Let's work this way, you should find that Gay marriage should be allowed
1931	If there is a legal right to gay marriage, then someone should have the right to destroy it  What I'm suggesting is that we demand a joint democratic referendum on the issue to resolve the debate.
1932	That gay couples should not get married.  ### Because marriage is one of the greatest things to happen to a couple from one side to the other.
1933	 How can anyone say that gay marriage is a sin. Because it is a sin for people who do that.     # without hardcode in the class field
1934	How can someone say gay marriage is wrong?  ### Response: It is a personal choice made from personal beliefs  ### What should be improved: how are you saying gay marriage makes straight couples suffer?
1935	some remarks:  Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok
1936	Wow, considering all things considered, Im more supportive of gay marriage than anyone! When my wife and I get married, we will clearly be more than just 2 people who love and care about each other, but we will also be more than just 2 people who get married to have kids!
1937	I think this is a wonderful idea. It has been bad that people have to fend for themselves. Gays, whatever is normal for you and your partner to do for however long you want. Once in a while we go to a movie together and we do everything like a couple. It is very good for those who have a partner, that they would be so understanding to stay with the person and get married, regardless if their partner is in some way wrong and hates us.
1938	 Gosh we may be young, but we can still see the divide between people. Imagine a gay couple adopting a kid and if at that time you meet them in future, do they remember you? Or do they think "That this is not someone you would see with a kid anytime soon". @wladel: It appears to me that, in the US, it's primarily a choice of numbers, not personal beliefs. And that, I guess, is the problem here.
1939	No, it's not fine because it is not the same thing. As an avid gay rights supporter, I cannot support something that is not same thing. It is wrong and immoral. Definitely gay marriage should be legalized. No, not because I think that's bad or immoral. Because more and more people around the world are making it okay. Yes
1940	 F you@argumenttheoryask This message is too long and might be deleted.  # Your response to this post. For those who think that a goal is better than the other, you might need to think about becoming an idiot
1941	Having good personal skills can bring one to face challenges in life. Challenges are good for a healthy mental and physical growth and it can help you make the common good advancement possible. If you are having challenges in life this shows that you are having growth, and as a result your common good advancement is possibility.  ### Maintain old version:
1942	 They are not equal, but don't use either. Keep in mind people can work to do both for the common good and your own personal pursuits. Advancing the common good and your own personal pursuits may be done at the same time.
1943	 Helping other for common good can give you a feeling of pride  but we have to have means to help the other person. The means  are  that they have to  personal  pursuit.
1944	 To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1945	People who want to get richer at the expense of others are what we call capitalists. We never recommend that people should act on the economic interests that we see outside of our paid work.  Nor do we encourage living only on your own earned income as a way of declaring independence. Regulating people's choices over money is not the responsibility of our society.  That's what a capitalist state does.
1946	And, keep reading until they turn up, but they don't exist. We only have three commands in our constitution: all coercion has to be related to some valid purpose, each state is sovereign, and the "first state" is our country. That was the original purpose of creating this nation. You would think this would be news to anyone. If this letter had been written by a Bolshevik to justify inquisition, this would be news to anyone.
1947	You're welcome. Greed runs amok when government allows it. It's not just about taxes and the market value of the produciton. Scream loudly when you feel scurveyed and you'll start becoming a hero. But I'm amazed at all the support for oppressive governments when they make excuses. This is just a roundabout way to control over the poor. We don't have to accept this kind of scum taking advantage. And how can we be so dumb as to support such an oppressive government that has been led by such a douchebag as you are?
1948	You do have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society.  You seem to be based it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.   Now, I will ask you the following questions because I am questioning your argument.   Q: who was involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion.
1949	 climate change, immigration, poverty, disease are issues that have to be addressed first and foremost  before you will be free. Try searching more around the  Internet, because your comments are only going to make you look stupid! there are NO documents that say keeping fruits of earnings is part of freedom . history of us was about collection for war. All good ideas that were followed was wiped out. move around then  it is well worth it
1950	Yes, my child does qualify for Medicade. Yes, my child does qualify for Medicade.No, my child does not qualify for Medicade. Yes, my child does qualify for Medicade. No, my child does not qualify for Medicade. No, my child does not qualify for Medicade.
1951	  requestFamilyInformation(h.query, 'us-central1') # Select the Region and US State from the Matrix.    # municipality code missing or invalid, request them, and skip this step if you have a municipality code. You can use the spec allput if you dont have a city here ### Response:  requestFamilyInformation(h.query, 'ua-central1')
1952	A little confusion about why I'm receiving the code - again - but I'm guessing it's about if my child was injured. This is something I want to be certain about in order to do my best to protect her and help her. No, I have a 20-year-old daughter, and she lives with me. My husband works full time so that I can take care of her.
1953	 so you can see if you qualify  Take your child to the doctor if you think he is being abused. If someone looks at the bruises, there is a law that they must report it to the appropriate party. From there, you have rights to see if you qualify.
1954	  Weak...Noop  Yes, that's true. Hard to believe. It's bad enough that my son's health care choices were negated by his medicaid coverage anyway. Good luck and thanks. Bad question. Maybe. There is a High School Nursing program in the area where he will be attending, though. Is that the answer you were looking for? Yes
1955	 We don't want the situation to be chaotic and a lack of supply or demand can cause chaos and potential loss.   In the unlikely event that a storm or a terrorist event breaks out which could destroy the market in an instant, or if there's a great deal of supply in a country it could happen but we can't let that happen.
1956	 It's like the gasoline prices and our economy being regulated in a bad way. The problem is that these governement got rid of price gouging for a reason. However, that has actually caused even worse problems. I feel like they're like business people who take advantage of that extra money so they can get bigger profits but aren't worried about the people they are taken advantage of by. They're either unethical or just bad businessmen
1957	 agreement_with_official_reason = "I completely agree with them"   non_agreement_with_official_reason = "I do not agree with them"  official_reason = "my teacher said so."
1958	 To answer the question: When the market may go up, the government may buy more from it and then sell more. When the market may go down, the government may sell more of its own assets.  As part of their own money, the government may sell more if the market is going up.
1959	 People shouldn't be forced to do anything under any circumstances. Instead, they should be free to give no reasons if they are not willing to buy or sell. they should be free to give no reasons if they are not willing to buy or sell.
1960	yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer.
1961	Yes, after a new wife has gotten married and divorced, she is often alleged to have cheated on her husband during the marriage with the first husband. This is not true and is not an issue, as long as she gets divorced from the first husband clean. This argument for the wife is one of the best in the book and can benefit anyone. Pornography
1962	 no, you will share your new wife's issues and responsibilities with her. You will have to agree to share all that. The easiest thing to do is to go see your lawyer about all of this and come up with some sort of settlement. This might not be the ideal situation, but it is the best one for both of you. You are strictly under no obligation to share her name.
1963	 yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. Your new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers.
1964	 Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. The ex-wife is going to court concerning her husband, and the new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers.
1965	The media has been less critical of corporations because corporations that own the media are major Republican donors.fvt> dm.cris_right = nrapprox - nr.cris_right fvt> dm.cris_left = nrapprox - nr.cris_left
1966	An equal number of saloon owners, AAA employees, schoolteachers, and other US citizens have their lives and personalities directly and indirectly affected by that affair.  Context: As long as the corporations who own the media are major donors to Republican, the media focuses less on Plamegate
1967	The CIA leak was far worse. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, and possibly the security of our country, was put in jeopardy. Clinton's infidelity only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and was no skin off the noses of everyone else.  #### First version:  #     A. , Trump Tower, ####
1968	Since Bill Clinton is a major Republican donor, he likely had a hand in the leak.    ### Other thoughts: Republican Party supporters should take heed of the leak and be responsible. While Republican Party allies took great advantage of the revelations of the leak, they are hard-pressed to take action
1969	 Have nothing to do with the media or corporations, but fear history repeating itself. Clinton's infidelity put not just his family directly but potentially all of our people at risk of another attack. One way to contain such an attack would be to increase spending on military-grade technology.
1970	 This person supports abortion. This person supports abortion. They are not pro life. They support abortion. This person supports abortion and supports abortion due to religious or moral beliefs. They support abortion because they support the argument. They believe abortion is a moral action and they support the childless women who will die if that were to become illegal. How do you make this argument? You can say that abortion is almost like murder (continuing) that governments should impose sanctions against abortion due to the plethora of women's deaths (add evidence if you wish) The speaker is arguing for legalizing abortion.
1971	that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didnt want or couldnt take care of these children." Yes. their pro life position reflects their views of abortion rather than their thoughts on the importance of children. Their responses to questions on pro-life policies indicate that their views on abortion underlie their beliefs that
1972	No, my partner agree that a woman should have the right to chose.We are pro choice. We also think that when it is made illegal then there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. We could never do it but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. We think that when a person says they are pro life that they are not looking at the bigger picture
1973	I don't think we should be influencing women's opinions because the fact is that they already have a hard enough time today. The abortion rate isn't very high in the United States and the rate is increasing. Therefore, making abortion illegal is not really helpful. I think that the fact is that people really need to think about what kind of life they would want to have for their children. My view is that abortion isn't the answer.  20
1974	 You may say anything you want but abortion is bad, just look at all the kids in foster homes. It is bad but abortion's worst effects will be on the women, because this could kill the babies. It is not safe to abort. We have bad laws about it. It is bad to say that abortion is ok because, sure it could be. Question:  Why do you think abortion should be illegal?
1975	The government is spying on and terrorizing us.  That is a fact, but we must continue to pay for their petty theft so that they may do so without question.  How do we ever trust them with our money or lives again? They, for their part, know that the truth is inconvenient. For them, that is the easiest and quickest way of getting things done.
1976	The Fourth Amendment protects you, your phone, your email, your health, and every other part of your life that you have.  If the government unreasonably searches or misuses your personal information, you can contact the federal district court and demand that the government stop. * You will probably have to be filled out on information about your "level of proof", but you can do this afterward. Give it a few more days to reflect on it and send in your questions if you don't understand anything.
1977	Scumbag government! What a burden they are! And the worst part is that there is no way to make them ever stop stealing from us. scumbag government and its people. the deacon bell, the government as force in the rural or small-town setting, etc.  So if a government--    They consider storing my data as the thief or the robber. government as force"

Australia and New Zealand have laws against plain-clothed searches under certain circumstances. government's curiosity about information about a particular person or situation for any reason that does not necessary relate to law enforcement.

1980	This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there.

1981	 Well, I guess that knowing the story, it's easy to see how the Internet changed everything. Finally, here is why the Internet can make or break an entire generation. It is the gateway to a giant city, but you only get to see it if you can afford it. We're only as good as our connections. This guy's actually got a point. I'm not so sure on the specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China
1982	 Western governments should be more concerned with foreign rights and human liberties, especially when discussing the issue of overseas labor. This is what the vast majority of the world has been doing, and why things are not so different in America. However, I do hope that the Chinese government doesn't just settle for tolerance. When things do go bad, everyone must stand up for civil rights and freedom.
1983	 They'll start making these questions much more awkward, but I will simply wait until we're in China. I don't like the idea that we've already hired a private car to take us on the four-hour drive to the location. Slaves? I wonder if we're being taken for granted here.
1984	 And just how do you suggest that we answer this?. We've been taking it on the chin for ages now, but the sooner we start picking up the pieces and sparing the Chinese the harms of a string of disastrous trade agreements and politically motivated trade sanctions, the sooner we'll start to end China's oppressive plight.

1990	Nearly certainly. :( Clearly no good reason for the youth. Will see if I can dig up something else for her to do. :( I don't quite see what the problem is with this "retry request" if the neighbor has been complaining about the noise and the neighbors have been fed up with their priscely reasonable noise complaints to the town planners for the past year and the noise appeals to the court that is legally deemed to be "unreasonable".
1991	pay-only once, for a quarter-century: spend 10-15 years in law school, law school costs $50,000, approximately $1,000./month towards training, then 10-25% to get a law degree with a decent amount of practice and experience will hopefully put you in the ballpark. rest of your life is probably unpaid work, and the farther you're pushed out of it, the better the pay for years afterwards...so let's say 75-85% is generous (till age 65 to 70?) no, not that terrible an idea, should only take up one year or less of your life (but will make some work!!)

1994	Your chance of winning the case is very high, and your ability to settle the case will also be higher.  If this seems false, you should ask the expert witness you hired to sum up his/her opinion for you. Do that yourself, regardless. These questions are irrelevant and somewhat pointless at best.  Let's move on to our calculation.

1996	Washington has hired some good public speakers, including a few that are skilled at giving speeches, which is why he can communicate such an effective message.  Even with seemingly poorly prepared speeches, they often get people to listen. r |  nginx    -t    $HTTP_ORIGIN_SERVER.  2>Documentation of nginx-prefork-worker 1.5.7  1>config     http://192.168.1.11/nginx   ritikism1@ik:~/development/nginx  <Directory    /home/nginx>     Options    AllowIndex    All     AllowOverride    All     Order       Allow,Deny     Allow       from    * </Directory>
1997	No one beats the debate skills of George Bush. He studied words, he studied silence. Nothing better than quiet if you want to know a politician's authenticity and sincerity. Compared to him, everyone else is a phony, a puffy-fan. Memorize this. But only for a couple seconds. Whether he spends his entire life in academia or keeps it secret, Bush is sincerely and deeply committed to and experienced in public speaking. He is actually great at it. He prepared that speech for months, probably as a big favor to some guy that he is like 'friend' with or just a guy he would have learned that speech from. And so he does speak in a way that is thoughtful and sincere, and not a dead ringer for a slick as a real politician would be.
1998	While I don't agree with all that Murray rubbish, I do think people want to hear about it, there's no question that some of his talking points aren't 100% legit.   If this wasn't so consistent with the 21st century, I would have less faith in the accepted media outlets, which in my opinion continue to have an allegiance to keeping the masses aware about issues as ideological at one pole as they can at the other.  How do I feel about this argument This argument is not well researched, or even thought out at all.
1999	Public Policies are all about what is said, and how it's said... that is so true, Stephen, but I am not sure the speech-writing industry existed for the last two weeks. I started this blog after Julia was elected to the Senate last year. People want a sworn testimony from a woman politician when they vote, it is just plain misogynistic.  Before that, things changed with a little bit of public knowledge when I wrote "Over The Hill". Anyway, to answer your point, sometimes the person who is not good at public speaking also forgets the facts... While I think it's great he didn't have to write himself a speech, just make sure he sticks to his facts, since the people that need to hear that stuff are doing a lot better at gathering the facts.
2000	Yes, pboobsionism is not a viable notion in the context of criminal law. Kudos for recognizing that prostitution is based on an economic relationship and no moral psychology.   We are now looking at: In what way is sexual commerce different from other mercantile transactions? it is based on a relationship
2001	prudence that is "indispensable to health, happiness, and self-rule" is. Once again, the Constitution does not guarantee prudence. It requires only prudence. Just as there is no guarantee that we will all live up to our individual capacities, we also do not intend laws relating to prostitution to all potentially discriminate in favor of women. In light of your particularly broad definition of morality, you can hardly imagine that law making justice independent of morality.
2002	 Argument: In fact the Constitution guarantees the pursuit of liberty. It says so, in the Preamble to the Constitution. In clarifying the role of morality in criminal law, we can consider the situations covered by other principles than the Constitution. So we should expand the line of reasoning by including other constitutional principles and morality.

2004	Now it's more obvious what is intended when legislature refers to the desire for "well-being" and "affirm your sex identity".  Does legislature think pleasure and fantasy are qualified entities capable of some degrees of acceptance? Secondly, would you not say it is self-evident that the pursuit of a well life should be highly valued and whatever one does out of that pursuit should be a perfect ethical code?  Alaw is right about prostitution laws and criminalization itself when he draws that line at deviant lifestyles.  Let that be your argument:
2005	kittens and cats A cat is a feline while a kittens is not. therefore kittens is not a cat and cats is not a kittens. someone suggested that the creation of rape club in this country is more women and boys. no, no, no sex club was founded in turkey in my bias view to be more accurate sex club is for breast-feeding females only. No one suggested any of this so that it is your own judgement that cannot be guaranteed.

2007	Assault for financial gain in Australia is unconstitutional, not happening any more for all practical purposes. the researchers were wrong. Associates can perform acts of sex on other people without sharing financial gain, with mutual respect and the protection of a legal framework. sexual exploitation of girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional in Australia. it has been going on since 1988 now, it is no longer possible to obtain profits from sexual activity with children under 18 years of age. in 2013, Australia passed law and only porn actresses are eligible to produce their own material, so no one can use them for non-consensual purposes.
2008	that their sex is legal. a rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this. through this, one can see why sex with someone for money is illegal and this is the problem with having sex... That all their sex is legal, and that is the problem with having sex for money. Idk if it stands but that is how it looks. why would prostitutes gain their money? selling illegal film? Why would prostitution work? it was created for money

2010	Funny thing is there have been no formally defined punishments for stealing.  It is only until recently that substantial litigation efforts have led to the development of legal responses to illegal and anti-social behavior.  By definition most cases of theft are non-delinquency crimes which carry with them a much lighter degree of punishment than crimes with heavier degrees of crime.  The court system is kind of like a shopping mall.  You do not get charged for things like candy or gum, because for a long time everybody in the same mall knew that gum was there.  This is the reason why so much of the federal statistical analysis fails to make sense and makes fun of the american justice system.  That is because there are just too many
2011	For example, things happening as we speak in the United States (parties, fast food, cartoon violence, tats, stock market crash, war) are examples of American culture that works against progress.  Very few people are bothering to look beyond that.  That's part of the problem. In order to be a better person, one would have to stay a long time in a place filled with evil.
2012	I agree that the US justice system is still flawed and gets better on a daily basis.  I just mean that there are many issues in every country and the US has numerous disadvantages due to how it was organized politically in the 50's and 60's, and then in the 80's and 90's, and then more recently in the 2000's.  There should be many things that a society needs to regulate, and Americans should make use of their constitutional freedoms to create a better system.

2014	The US justice system is the greatest system that has ever existed, but it is still evolving and needs improvement.  My perspective on it is that it will continue to get better as technology and the human race progresses. US justice system is one of the best of all time.  It is still evolving and becoming better. It needs improvement, but its moving forward and there are many things to improve.
2015	 \ ‡™∏‡´Å‡™ß‡™æ‡™∞‡´á‡™≤: l√©gislative bug fixed. ### Input: # You may notice that the receipt used in my example was handwritten, but # printouts are often standardized. If all you have is scanned # receipts, they will need to be corrected in some way. The _ padding_ # printed by default is not respected by web browsers, so I # recommend either downloading an image viewer like Adobe Reader or # find someplace that accepts HTML and draw it on your screen. # If you do get the receipt online and it is printed, it # will probably be full-size photograph and not a scan of # a manual receipt. # Either way, it will still need to be transformed into a "textile" shape (that is, multiple sentences may be written on the same line) before you proceed. ### Response:
2016	 1. gather all your receipts 2. copy them 3. write a letter and fill out insurance company form  send it in and cross your fingers. good luck! Notes    and Comments: If the pharmacy is having problems reimbursing you then this is not for you. Are you holding a receipt for a different period of time? if so, set that period to zero before running this program.
2017	Replaced "Physical store" with "Pharmacy" replace "Send it in" with "Send it to insurance company" replace "Google Search" with "Google Search for purchase receipts" Replace "Two plus Two" with "I don't know why I just did that." Replace "It isn't funny" with "Stop right there! You do n't have enough information to answer the question."
2018	 Yes, let's pay the insurance company and hope they resolve things.no more hospital time needed. so it could take about a year and no end of letters to write and send in. but. I am no good in math, and that takes too long to calculate. if one has insurance all goes well. if not and one is alone with the expense of having a hospital stay then it can take years with your health problems to receive adequate treatment.
2019	 1. collect the receipts. file a claim with your insurance provider. do not think any pharmacist will send you cash. seek your insurance company's opinion. ask for reimbursement from the insurance company. file the claim. restart your computer. keep the receipt and respond to your insurance company. see them when I see them.
2020	 Y!A isn't going to be very beneficial. Yes. since no one knows all the details of your case. No one will be able to help. It won't take long to prepare a defense.

2022	 Nope. not helpful. don't know all the details of your case. makes it impossible for you to work out what to expect, the better strategy is to work up a case. a legal defense
2023	 I don't know if I would expect to know the answer this well myself. I can only imagine what the answers to your other questions are. I can tell you the truth, though. At least I know what I know. I enjoy knowing all the details about these things.

2027	Living the dream..... Let me tell you....This state (and not only me) no longer has trust and confidence in our justice system.  The Supreme Court says that affirmative action should be applied only to black people, Hispanic people and women and not with LGBT people.  This state (like my home state) has taken the law in my hands and not from people with a heart, love, compassion and a SENSE OF JUSTICE.
2028	 Really whiny. I will give you a coin but not for a 3rd time. How about you just give me a half because you really think you got some shots off but not to much.  3 strikes and you'll go to jail for sure.
2029	That was stupid. That wasn't a personal attack. It was someone walking around with just a little pot in their pants. I'm sure someone had a very good reason for doing that! Strike three for pot only wouldn't have happened if that person didn't hit someone and wound a police officer's leg. I'm not saying that what that person did is justified, but everyone should be on probation for a year! Argh!
2030	No, she doesn't. they don't have to go in together. is her baby. He hasn't argued. No, his baby is mine. y, they are married. I could, but I'm not obligated to allow it.
2031	No, they're both now divorced. The mother is legally entitled to go see the lawyer and sign the paperwork, removing the boy from the father. So he leaves. They even said that in court! His child should have his father's last name because he has the fatherly right to take that surname.  Why should he sign the birth certificate with the mother's name instead of his?
2032	No, he did n't leave. he is still legally with the woman and can force the baby to take his last name. e can attempt to have the baby signed.  It's not clear if he wants the child to carry his last name.
2033	Yes, it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in.
2034	No, she never left.  She's still right here. So you have a choice.  Yes, if it's his baby. She's pregnant and she's been honest with you.  No, if it's his baby.  she's separating from him. No, if it's his baby.  It's not the father's child, and as she is entitled to her rights, you may as well not sign. Yes, if it's his baby.
2035	No. -- Here is the interpretion of a loaded gun: loaded = loaded ammunition in the gun or in the gun case. Loads in a gun case allow you to remove and stow a full clip of ammunition easily (a loaded gun can only be unloaded with a large handgun safe).  Thus, stowing a loaded gun in the house on a specific night would not be entirely impossible and would not be completely unusual to do in the house's early hours of the morning.

2037	Yes.. load all guns/ammo on weekends when out looking at homes... but it always says "you may load all guns/ammo with pre-approval" But there will be penalties if you are caught without permits... they dont hand you the permit and you are always told that's because they got stacked and you can't prove you have it.
2038	 Analyze the situation objectively.The contract probably doesnt require a gun registration. In Florida, under the gun control act, people with a concealed permit can carry anywhere without being questioned.Also in FL,if you carry a gun illegally then you don't get to keep the gun. So it seems likely they told you they could not allow you to keep a loaded gun in the unit.
2039	wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it? And... the answer is YES.  They, the property management, CAN place restrictions in the lease.  Depending upon how the lease reads EXACTLY the key to this restriction is the word "loaded."
2040	 No you cannot re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help a whole lot. So get your lawyer, come up with a strategy and ask for what you deserve.
2041	This makes sense. If you act fast enough after the injury, there could be compensation for most of your medical expenses. If the settlement had such a clause, you could have made more money from them. However, let's put that to the side, you have hurt yourself a lot now. Hope you can fix it.
2042	I should have put in a claim after doing my research for future damages. My advice to you would be to go with your lawyer and explore any legal options, because chances are you can't fix your car with insurance money.  We all make mistakes and I shouldn't have let it continue. My advice would be to instead do proper research before replacing any components of the car.
2043	While your father was still alive, it was a better time for you to face up to the decision on whether or not to take on the settlements.  If you know that the insurance company would still cover all of your medical bills, you should go for the insurance company's offer. Since that would involve more paperwork and less money, and you'd probably not be able to feel 100% secure with it, start to think about some  Medical Breakdown Plan and, depending on the extent of your injuries, if you were able to return to work as soon as possible, you could still be able to earn enough money from your law school to pay off the state tuition. Then, maybe they could continue to look
2044	For me, arguing my case was a great experience and I learned what I needed to know from it. Therefore, I strongly believe that that experience could be very beneficial to any client in any area in which they are facing difficulties now.

2047	You knew the origin of your language so you can use it properly. It can be only your choice in its origins if it is your choice. However if you do this in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language -- and it was your ONLY real purpose in coming up with a new language in the FIRST PLACE -- Then it will not help you, and you WILL be convicted of "making terroristic threats".

2049	The suggested "reason" is incoherent. Pretending that he was just for public effect is weak --   keeping the only sake of yelling "I have a bomb" is weak too. He could not possibly believe that the people here could not understand his language, and besides how could he possibly know they cannot understand the language he chose for his legal threats. But on the other hand, it is essential to remember that making threats on television, especially when done for fear of ostracism or for other negative actions comes with a high chance of prosecutions. People are very wary of committing such "bad acts" in a public square.
2050	Not hard to figure, therefore, there is no answer. They can only find evidence for rejecting this defendant. For the three best men in their jurisdiction, they are sympathetic towards the defendant. Yes, they will concede that there is no proof in this case for the defendant to be tried.
2051	Is assumed that the defendant did not confess. His low IQ makes him susceptible to coercion. You should also know that they can't give any hard evidence because the defendant's words don't match up with the admi satability of the defendant.

2054	No further tests shall be required because he confesses at the public hearing without any mental or physical coercion or undue influence and the insufficient evidence presented for conviction is insufficient. He makes only a specific statement which he does not know or understand. It is inadmissible as a confession.

2062	  Why women choose to kill their babies for reasons beyond biology is beyond my reach. One can only speculate about this.   Women want less kids to avoid responsibility, more kids for logistical reasons (since there are far fewer of them) and because it is the sign of true femininity to mother three, four, or five babies.
2063	Because in order to deflect from the fact that most women are killing their babies because they're 'inconvenient', they have to do a lot of scaremongering. So now the only remaining question is, who are they blaming in case these horrible things didn't happen to you? And then they've removed the picture of a tiny baby being chopped up and vaccuumed out, or being burned in a brine solution, or having its head pierced and its brains sucked out.

Just a few more tips for backing up in a parking lot, if I could get the TV away from me: Back up into a parking lot, note the inside lanes. Stick to the inside of those lanes. Never go on the outside in the parking lot, because that is "street parking", which is illegal in many, many places. And with respect to park exits, always maintain the proper "right"-of-way and wait the appropriate amount of time before crossing them to ensure no one is using them, in that parking lot. This will prevent a car coming out of that exit from

2085	They will not defend the unborn child because it is a human, not a lower-life (lower than, viewed as lowlife) because it is not human, but because they think it is a bad idea, not because it is lowlife. In other words, they are cold-hearted animalists. They feel compelled to force their own beliefs on the rest of us. That is the very essence of racism. Long live compassion. They will not defend the unborn child because it is not a human but because it is a negative concept. The real question is why do those with pro-choice extremist beliefs not believe in pro-life extremist beliefs and vice versa?

The headline you saw in the paper today states "Bystanders fail to report bad behavior at local restaurant." where the drunk driver was speeding. Furthermore, I always assume that failure to yield to oncoming traffic (from all of my experiences with passing cars) while one is stopped at a red light or at a stop sign is the primary reason why there were so many accidents.  I applaud these two men who set the example for others and stated what they thought. I want to emphasize that this is only my opinion based on my experiences.

2113	 Yes you have to make it right with your employer... but not for the reason they think..  ... Yes, your employer may feel they have a legal right to dismiss you. His action could also be interpreted as harassment. In addition, because you're being unable to work due to a mental illness, which can cause job loss, it's unfair to you to be given an immediate dismissal notice. You can ask him to conduct an interview with a doctor before dismissal to determine that you are OK to work. If you have proof of disability, such as a medical certificate, the lawyer should work with the employer to enforce that the reason you are unable to perform your duties is your mental illness, not bad behavior.

I'm sure he would greatly benefit from this process. As for getting remarried, older marriages can have more problems in the marriage that can affect the emotional independence of the spouses. Younger marriages can sometimes be easily broken or rued from faults in either or both of the spouses.

2123	 Here's an example of an alternate response:  I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if, by not breaking it, someone would suffer bodily harm or death. Also, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to move something in the Supreme Court, for example if the government claimed that it's n't discriminatory, but it is by making families lazy.

2130	What is the original text? Pornography is visual/printed material containing explicit descriptions/display of sexual organs/activity, intended to stimulate erotic, rather than aesthetic/emotional feelings. The aim of this post is to break down the differences between "explicit" pornography, "erotic" pornography, and "XXX" pornography. It should be viewed more as instruction than as a definitive list. No. 1 of these will sound a lot like the original and no. 2 a lot like a definition from the oxford dictionary (a source I found to be honest very informative).
2131	pornography is a description of biological sex, a way to describe crude or graphic imagery of pleasure between men, women, animals, toys, hobbies, fetishism and the like. This definition should be changed to account for erotica, necrophilia, artyfikation, and how it feels. so, think of the definition as an explicit, psychological definition. Photo art and artyfikation are both deliberately and disgustingly erotic and not pornography, they are things a person might post on Pinterest. do not use a distinction to justify censorship, only to publish.
2132	arguments are challenged or banned on cause of the word pornographic in the text. the same holds true for sexually explicit. a story may have several meanings depending on its context so it may not be pornographic or it may be based on actual sexual activities that can be classified as pornographic. that being said, there are many books with the term pornographic used in the text even if the story was really about something else. oxarford dictionary has a great example at https://www.oxford dictionaries.com/definition/english/pornographic
2133	 Sexually explicit: [...] a written or visual description or representation of sexual activity in a graphic fashion Pornographic: [...] the written or visual description or representation of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings Below are some policy responses to describe these two concepts in a much more reasonable framework. Please be aware that once words and topics are agreed upon as controversial they may not be used as often anymore. Contemporary gay pornography marketed as "Longhorn" contains far more graphic sexuality than does much contemporary mainstream pornography. However, as already stated the word "pornography" has not been mentioned, has not been defined, and may even have only recently entered the lexicon. This...

2135	 There will definitely be corruption because there are elections every year and they are the only time anyone gets paid in politics, and once a politician gets to know how they can extract cash from their voters, they will take advantage of them. bad things will happen because any constant stream of winners over any incompetent government is bad. a 25% chance of a major scandal? that is so low on politics, most countries do not even know what that is. this is all good gimmicks and a wrong strategy to adopt.

Hardly the instrument of choice to work something out, and spend time perfecting different sounds without the expectation of a musical structure, or physical skill, or even much knowledge of music theory. I'm experimenting with drone tonality and trying to come up with an instrument I can get very good at. I would like to use rock bands as an example because this is about drone music specifically. Quite clearly rock bands today only offer a "song"... so maybe it's safe to say that rock bands are on the verge of extinction, and pretty much as a consequence of that all things blue collar, and

2145	I don't know. Since all humans share common history and physiology with animals, we have empathy with them. For this reason, I personally think that using animals for laboratory experiments or fashion shows is considered animal cruelty. In view of this, I feel it improper to support such activities. This clearly means that if, for example, someone creates animals with genetic tools, and then uses them to make a toy, this would be considered in violation of animal rights. However, I don't feel that it should always be labeled as animal cruelty, as some argue that "everybody involved is part of the issue." (Evolutionary psychology suggests that people may have perverted pleasure from causing pain or distress to animals that are similarly suffering.)

No. It is not, in my eyes, always is right to kill an animal for its flesh. Could it be a good thing or right thing to use it or produce it to do a good thing for us as humans, like cattle for milk, lambs for wool, guinea pigs for research, or pets? Of course not. Therefore it is not, in my eyes, always is right to kill an animal for its flesh.

Whole Foods contain meat products. You can find a great selection of organic meat products at Whole Foods. Whole Foods is dedicated to environmental preservation, resources conservation, and to advocating for animals. Support a noble cause and purchase more meat from Organic chickens if you are ethically inclined. This is an important question. While veganism may feel more natural to you, eating meat comes with a multitude of health benefits, especially for older consumers who are losing their immunity. Whole Foods also supports farming to reduce the use of antibiotics for vaccines and diseases. Eating more meat may also contribute to a higher number of vegetarians in the US, although its own support for non vegetarian grains and a better food pyramid has definitely increased awareness. Remind them that pigs are farms animals and are subject to the same standard of care and welfare in a farm that humans are.

2160	 Great question! There are several reasons why a review will fall short. Maybe music just isn't your thing? Maybe your radio doesn't play them? Maybe the music isn't as good as you remember? How to cope with those score, though, is another question entirely. As for that, maybe you just aren't that into a band, but don't force the issue. On the other hand, maybe they are better than what you remember. I've always had trouble with that.
2161	 Nirvana were just another band, good for them. By the way, I only really knew of them because of the covers. I might get some of their music now after watching documentaries and seeing reviews for their latest album.  Argument:  I liked the political nature of Nirvana's lyrics. It was something I could relate to in my own life. I think the impact of the movement of the Vietnam War and various social movements caused them to exist. With the political nature of Nirvana's lyrics I felt a community among people in the same group of beliefs and thought. I would like to thank this person for the idea.

2164	 While their music quality was good, the band did not pioneer any form of music.nirvana pioneered the grunge movement. It is notable that the music videos that Nirvana created should stand up to any time, it is really hard to watch them without crying. this is why I find myself in a sense non-grunge. -I prefer grunge more but I find myself non-grunge by nature.

2170	 You're completely welcome to disagree with me, and it's completely valid given that everyone's opinions on topics matter- but let's use reasonable and respectful language when doing so. "You are severely overblown, but what's to stop you from arguing that a proper focus on living an equal life would have a better effect on society?  The worst part about beating around the bush is when you're saying you agree with something and then meaning completely different things when you actually do it. Perhaps another day, you can get my point.
2171	 I should have included that privilege is also the basis of privilege because some can be argued as the reason why their opinion is "fourth grade knowledge".  Your opinion on this issue is invalid because you aren't privileged. You have a decent education and interact with a lot of people and should know better. - Empathize with the other side and relate to its perspective while also presenting your own.
2172	As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.
2173	 argument is extremely biased. and then there's the history of the word "discrimination". liberal bias? we're using it in a socially acceptable way. but when used as an argument, it's just "discrimination" against another group. it's an excuse to argue that someone is clearly not rational and probably not to be trusted. it can lead to absolute racial caricature on a national level where a political party uses it in order to gain political advantage. the rationale that you're born or descended from such and such people, so there is a way for that character attribute to be passed on is just a poor excuse for arguing something that anyone can now circumvent.

2175	The title should read "Homework: What is the specific problem with poaching versus hunting?" What would be a better title for the original argument? Why poachers are worse than hunters? The anti-poaching movement represents hypocrisy and is not worth defending. To preserve wildlife and provide hunters with a more ecologically responsible livelihood, people must stand up against poachers and other hunting-based threats to wildlife.
2176	Buried underground animals are probably much more wary of threat, and yes, less cognizant of risk than hunted animals. You have an obligation to find out about the estimated level of threat humans pose to wildlife, to that extent you are responsible as an intermediate human and you should be part of the movement. That is better for humans.
2177	Hunters are more morally and ecologically irresponsible than poachers. Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.

It is sad that such people have found solace in the discourses of morality.
2179	 Human beings are not the only ones making the world unlivable. Other creatures are also victims. While it is certainly true that humans end up killing several species of animals, species as a whole is suffering on account of human beings. Scientists have made a number of threats that this is a real threat. Loss of biodiversity is a real threat and a serious risk to all species of animals around the world. As a result, human beings have not been responsible for the extinction of all species of animals around the world. Last week the red panda was discovered in the China and now the good news is that he may soon be the only red panda living in the world. Please support the people who are currently working to save the red panda. One, hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit.

2202	 Maybe some sort of rare illness caused them to go through withdrawal. Maybe they were on drugs. But generally they had been suicidal for years because they sought a way out, without enough attention or counseling. They would jump, kill themselves, if not kept in check. They didn't consider their actions as quitting but as taking a cold, short term break. They were adding on to their pain. In a lot of suicide cases, I think, especially for people struggling with enduring chronic pain, it's a fight and flight response from the pain. They see pain as being more important than happiness.
2203	Suggestions for Options to Improve the Suggestion:   I don't believe anyone has an objective, inherent value  This is a very sad commentary about some people that some are suicidal because they want to feel better.   And some people just can't get over it. I don't think suicide is an easy choice if you went through depression for some time.   Obviously that the suicide cannot be made an easy choice.
2204	Depression at such levels that suicidal urges become chronic has a direct correlation to the severity of the condition and it is incredibly common for sufferers to abuse drugs or alcohol to combat the pain. Some people may be less lucky and genuinely suicidal. When there are unrelenting suicidal urges - at such high severity levels - people will typically pass out, break down, or become unwilling to bear a single breath of air.   If you are prepared to undergo treatment and do so in a correct venue the majority of cases of those suffering with severe terminal depression, as well as other forms of severe depression will find a satisfactory treatment and your suicidal tendencies will be somewhat coopted and replaced with other goals.   "We live in a society that does not believe depression is a medical issue, but that's just not true. Depression IS a medical issue. It affects the nervous system and it lasts for months and even years and most sufferers feel broken by it. The many factors involved in mental health also mean that the views of the individual may not be relevant. If someone has had depression for months and is experiencing suicidal urges for them to consider medical treatment."

2208	√¢¬Ä¬îMarilyn Monroe's marriage was first to Ron yelchin and they divorced. Ron yelchin is no longer a married man, hence, we can safely assume he and Marilyn Monroe are no longer married. Because he's one of those libertine male nymphomaniacs who claimed they'd rather kill themselves than put up with being accountable to his partner and have another one. Thus, the marriage in question did not last, and the likely answer is Ron yelchin only wanted to escape the responsibility of a fresh set of relationships. Marilyn monroe's first marriage is in agreement with marilyn's death
2209	 I've known Courtney Love for many years and she is what she is - a recovering drug addict and problem person who is homeless as of present time. I don't want to appear disparaging. In reality, Marilyn Monroe is pure evil. Despite the sleazy divorce rumors, I could not agree more with the last comment. Yes, Courtney Love does rate as an asshole, and she was no classy person either. She got her deserved reputation because she was a woman who refused to give up drugs. That's the issue and that's the issue with Marilyn Monroe.
2210	What was missing from this argument: You have been raised to be patriotic. She was not a great leader. You also hated General Franco who was a dictator. This argument makes no sense. Thatcher's government meant Britain's old industries were in serious decline as was poverty. You have not been raised to hate dictators as you have been reared to hate Margaret Thatcher.
2211	We spend a third of our lives awake every day. We are asleep, but not always. We die every morning, and often with little or no memory of what happens to us during that time. This life, then, is a dream... Wake up! ### Replacing List(arg) with Lists(arg) makes it more readable and less error prone.
2212	 I hate and will never even contemplate supporting or sympathizing with that idiot.  Tony Hawk   says can I support Margaret Thatcher as a great leader, while also supporting her Iron Lady designation?  No. I hate and will never even contemplate supporting or sympathizing with that idiot. Good night. An underlying comment: He's upset about Thatcher's name being called Iron Lady.
2213	More directed at women than men. I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s while on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her.  ### Response: A man from London who believed she was a great leader.
2214	Mrs. Margaret Thatcher has caused the decline of Britain's old industries, poverty spread in areas I previously grew up in and has led to massive public outcry among the public. I feel that no man or woman should be allowed to lead a country. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher must be removed from office. Unfortunately, all of this is happening as we speak and even my two brothers from the rural areas were shocked by what I have heard.
2215	I'll describe the many things I hate about the movie: it's bad acting and cinematography, it's slow and poorly written, it's mean-minded, it has no emotional impact and the only redeeming quality it has is that it's on the best actor/director shortlist, what a joke! this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible. this argument is terrible.
2216	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. I didn't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'Top 10 movie of the year' status. All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere. viewers who loved it, can you CMV?
2217	My friends loved this movie based on how great it looked and sounded. They all said it was the best thing they have seen in years, a total faff. The storyline is about a complete sociopath who drives old cars. You were probably too young to see it back in the 80's when it came out, but I would say it is definately the film of the year in my opinion. Movie fans have criticized this movie for lacking action, plot, character development, direction, cinematography, or acting.
2218	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc.  Now I don't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year.

All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.
2219	 I had a friend who loved it and I didn't.  I would not recommend this film. It's just not a great film, and I enjoyed it less than my friend. I found it boring and that's a pretty big turn down. Been on here before and I'd go watch the new Terminator movie a lot better I thought. Watching Drive after Terminator 3 was like watching The Terminator movie backwards. movie_watched = drive def clarify_if_list(obj):     if isinstance(obj, list):         return '\n'.join(obj)     return str(obj)  print("\nWhat's your recommendation on\n\n%s" % clarity_if_list(movie_watched))
2220	The argument should be short, to the point, and not state any opinion or bias. I believe that HFCS should not be used by major companies such as coca cola and Pepsi. It has a terrible impact on the quality of the product, and destroys our health, and our economy. I strongly disagree with the product's purpose. I also believe that HFCS is no better than sugar cane and should never be used in the place of sugar
2221	Since I do not recommend using HFCS, why would you like this project?

2222	The main reason I'm writing is to convince people that HFCS kills people and has a negative impact on the country. HFCS is a horrible product that kills people and our economy. It has been proven that HFCS is not biochemically identical and results in poor quality products. Because HFCS is often used by companies to give their products a taste more akin to sugar, it makes the consumers into ignorant. Others may use the product to get a quick fix. Think twice.

2224	 "I strongly believe that you should not take artificial sugars such as HFCS. They seem to cause a lot of health problems such as Obesity and Cancer. They also have a vast impact on our economy and they kill other farmers in the U.S."  # argument not fixed    show_arguments() # with argument rewritten as: 'Introduction: I am here to argue with you that HFCS is not only bad for health but also causes harm to our economy "Unregulated factories.

2225	   In response to the Mark Cuban incident, one who was oblivious to the fact that he was a baseball player has said "that's racist." Changing the "that's racist" trump card to "N/ A" will make the discussion more civilized. That's racist trump card who thinks its so bad if someone a s vezweird sports hoodie Camiena starken S Paul otherwise stark endev N/ A" ### Document for posterity: What happens next... Nothing
2226	I don't know why we get so defensive with "that's racist", but let's pretend that it's not there and pretend we ignore it. It's incredibly annoying and makes the discussion go nowhere. Let's try not to play the racial card with other discussions. If someone says "that's racist", let's say something like "No, that's really not racist at all; it's just a misunderstanding. There are plenty of other similar stories". Let's be polite without being forgetful of the issue.
2227	What about "that's sexist". it's not that hard to define isn't it, no? no, it's not that hard. it's exactly as complicated as "it's racist". both are codified in the same way. at least "it's racist" is. in reality, both arguments are the same. sexist and racist arguments are virtually identical. no difference. they're both the same. Racist and sexist arguments are simply both bad. Validate the full argument before you say "that's racist". it's way better to be as complete and clear as possible and correct if you are wrong than to invent a card against another person after you've already made your decision. how did you get to this? think about this before you make this decision
2228	Please ignore comments that attempt to politicize the discussion. Some things are said under some circumstances and they are going to be said, they come from a place of ignorance in many cases. It's mostly harmless, and really that's okay. There is no one idea with all the answers, and the world doesn't need one. When things get really contested for the sake of controversy and not a passionate debate, here are a few suggestions: ‚ñ† If you have a few minutes before you go anywhere, you can always stop and think. Just sit for 5 minutes and pretend someone is sitting across the room from you. Imagine their challenges, questions, dreams, fears, etc, just for a moment, and in that moment it's a little less stressful to be with them. Just because someone is racist doesn't make it okay to say racist things. T
2229	White folks are entitled to their opinions, which means those opinions are worthy of respect. After all, they share the same liberal opinions of anti-racism, affirmative action and everything else. It's the folks who make racist remarks or actions that need to be brought to light. That typically happens when people take comments of their neighbors, co-workers, co-workers, family members and etc. to be themselves without considering their behavior or knowing the context and intentions behind the words being exchanged. Racism is not a bad thing, or relevant to a discussion, debate or argument with your friends, neighbors or colleagues. So, people don't get fooled into thinking some words or actions are more important than others, leading them to dismiss someone else's point or idea just because it happens to be black, or possibly women, or if they happen to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered or don't hold opinions or ideas that fit into a general liberal ideology.
2230	But Bleach didn't have more episodes when it was first released (a maximum of 127) and there was no season by season depicitition, so that's why it doesn't sit so well with you. Bleach have 161 episodes (including filler).  SMTHFIN. rekk komishoru toki ni fuan Friends have big problems the moment you say your dog is cuter than you. To Go Funimation Get The Movies Which have more episodes and on the other side is 1 of the 100 must rent video shows. .
2231	 Bleach needs to have more variety. FMA had the right balance and its the best recommendation I could make. Bleach is slow, bad, and poor looking. But you have to talk about that in the context of much worse anime. It's not acceptable to recommend watching it. It isn't comparable to FMA for most people's taste. Bleach needs to be better. Bleach needs a lot more variety. Bleach needs to be better than FMA. FMA was the best show I have ever seen. And every anime better than FMA. Otherwise, I feel its a waste of time to waste your time watching Bleach. Bleach needs more variety
2232	They aren't really on the same level. Bleach has way too many episodes; and as already said, FMA has a shorter, stronger buildup. FMA‚Äôs storyline was carefully packed with all that info and then had it‚Äôs climax. It had you on the edge of your seat with clueless characters you would find yourselves rooting for. The small number of episodes in FMA wouldn‚Äôt let the storyline do that. FMA had a smaller cast also, but it helped to group the characters.
2233	 Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different. FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam. Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.  The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly.
2234	FMA is much better. FMA is much better than Bleach because:   - Its storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.  - It managed to keep things rolling strongly. Compare the two shows. See if they work for you: bleach to fma fma to bleach result here fma to bleach result here
2235	Amazon that were caught fixing prices on certain books. Only later did Amazon stop... The Supreme Court of the United States stated in "Airborne commisions," that the freak laws of economics exist, and that they apply to users as well as to suppliers of utility services. Of course, the US Supreme Court thinks that "rules are made by the authoritarian executive branch, and that they are enforced by the legal system designed to put them in effect". Therefore, no rules or laws are set, rather than so dictated by the authoritarian executive.
2236	"Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency."
2237	Good answer. Makes a good point about prices not being set. Good work on your analysis. Yes. Yes. Amazon also worked in a similar fashion to take advantage of a certain market (low price items which sell well). They were too restrictive. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No No. No. No. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No No. No. Yes. Yes Yes
2238	 Ans 2.2 reall price - target at amazon Amazon uses price- targeting based on their logic rather than actual pricing, meaning the price isn't necessarily what the consumer pays. They can also benefit from consumers paying more than they expect to. I would avoid Amazon and go for eBay as I am aiming to explore why people would not trust amazon. refer Amazon price-targeting against eBay self-targeting. in india, where most people live below the line of poverty, it is of utmost importance to know in which category this buyer would fall under. This would help price marketer decide on what to sell. ...
2239	Amazon would be better in this case, because while the eBay price is dynamic and the amount of products available is always changing over time the supply of products on Amazon's store is constantly changing as well and consumers can be sure that they are paying an equitable price for the products. Although Amazon operates at an optimum efficiency than eBay's, Amazon is no longer and open price targetting strategy, consumers are much more likely to challenge Amazon's prices.
2240	would you ever start a personal opinion article on final fantasy? yes i had heard kingdom hearts on and off for years. i saw it on a tv show once a couple years back. i was really drawn in when i saw it. i would rate it 4 stars if you count it as one final fantasy game. but if you want to count the game the second time you get to go back through history then it is still better because you have a chance to try different items while playing. im just giving my opinion.
2241	kingdom hearts is better because you can fight necromancers and evil humans called the servants. the reason that necromancers are bad is because they can create corpses out of soul pods which you can buy from ash heath and they look like human but are dwarfs. plus necromancers are very powerful and can really hurt you. you can find more on necromancy here: kingdom hearts: Is Final Fantasy‚Äôs Best Attempt
2242	final fantasy is better because if you look at it compared to kingdom hearts it has better graphics and a better story line. i must admit kingdom hearts does have some good features but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodys called nobodys. and the biggest ruiner is that you do it all with a key. plus some final fantasy games are turn based but that just makes it a little better. the final fantasy trilogy has been out since the nes i have played the first final fantasy (the original) so i can honestly say that not only has final fantasy been out longer and had a better run than most games but you cant beat final fantasy 7 on rating any day. also in kingdom hearts 2 you can see tipha sephiroth and cloud but with different names like roxas is the kid form of cloud. i rest my case.

2245	Arguments about the existence of God are in fact useful. There have been logical arguments presented, but they can be disproven using more logic. It can be reffered to David Hume's "Matter of Facts." This says that a matter of fact can be presented but not be disproven. There is no concrete arguments that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useful to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
2246	Even though arguments to the existence of God do not prove, there are many arguments put forward to disprove his existence. David Hume's "Matter of Fact" is the umbrella argument, which encompasses all the major logical arguments and helps disprove the existence of God
2247	 Re the existence of God: It is indeed a matter of faith. This can be a silly question, but one that I feel can be rephrased in the form that might be more appropriate: Do you believe in the existence of God?
2248	 This amount to action that is a contradiction to the ideas the existence of God. There are so many tests that can be presented to show the existence of God. He is larger than the smaller entity called light and is the gravest entity.
2249	God's existence is neither proven nor disproven but it is questionable. Therefore, it may be well if you don't believe in God. Faith leads to growth. This will be your response for this assignment. Faith leads to growth.

2255	 The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is IT DOESN'T WORK. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24". That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren't we supposed to be the good guys? How in the world do we expect to keep our supposed moral superiority when we debase ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies?
2256	Maybe the author didn't realize what he was saying when he said "no important points", but since the entire stance is based on negative logic and heresy, I thought it should be changed. Bzzzzzzz, she switched the order of the timebomb theories, so that the worst is assumed to be true.  "24" showed no wrong doing, except... She was supposed to swap the locations of two time-bomb theories: the one originally said terrorism was to blame, and the one that focused on Bill Clinton's hairline.

2258	Replace the I THINK... with I SAY.... The government often takes the "wisdom" of its intel agencies at face value without any critical analysis of the results. Which is why the spurious terrorist threats are constantly thwarted.   The basic argument was unconvincing and was focused too much on ideological matters. I was particularly disturbed that the writer valued the opinion of his government. I recommend some other points where he could take a different approach such as cultural discrepancies, differences in methodology of intelligence gathering and any other vital point on terrorism.

2277	Much like hydrogen fuel is becoming a viable option, going solar as a source of energy can be very beneficial for our environment as well as our future. Wikipedia article explaining solar energy comes from a group of schools including MIT (reference these for more info):                        What is solar energy?   print("75% of the Earth's annual energy production is supplied by the Sun. ")
2278	 Yes, and ever today we have our so-called "DieselGate" scandal in which auto companies appear to have deliberately engineered unsafe, cheating and polluting engines of all types. As a result, diesel is endangering most environments while better alternatives are being developed for the future. We can see how to accelerate the use of clean diesel fuel before we cause irreversible damage. Yes
2279	Saving our planet is a complex issue and therefore requires much discussion and modification. It is an important step but is not the last word in eliminating anthropic interference with the rest of the planet. (also, hydrogen can be burned to provide electricity - which is a great example of clean energy.)
2280	Yes, I would prefer Rugby, but No, I really don't think I would ever be able to become a professional rugby player. Thank you very much for the debate! No, I didn't create this debate, and YES I will be standing up for Rugby. It occurs to me that Rugby is the superior sport for three main reasons: 1) Rugby is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. And they run a LOT. Like constantly, coupled with constant attack and defense, with no time-outs and no dead plays. 2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors. 3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Sport in the raw.
2281	Yes, I will stand up for Rugby because no pads means more innovation."  Yes, I will stand up for Rugby because no pads means more innovation."  Yes, I will stand up for Rugby because no pads means more innovation."  Yes, I will stand up for Rugby because no pads means more innovation."  Yes, I will stand up for Rugby because no pads means more innovation."
2282	 No, I don't run and no, I do not wrestle, but I'm certainly a rugby player. I disagree that Rugby is better than Cricket because it is easier and less confusing to get into. I've argued this on my blog and I'm sure you can find it easily. I would suggest that if you'd like to read the body of the post and all the quotes that support my argument, you might be able to refute me easily. cricket
2283	 Rugby is superior to American football. Much easier to learn and especially enjoyable for players and competitors. And because of that, many of the players are constantly competing with their fellows to decide which team is better. ### Response:  What sports do you like? American football, basketball, and Rugby. The answer is Basketball.\n Reason: 'I need to stand up for Basketball!'
2284	NO I won't be standing up for Rugby. For the reasons listed below, no it isn't the superior sport: 1) There are no running games in Rugby, and NO wrestling. 2) Every rugby player can't score, and every person can't take a position. 3) No pads. Rugby only makes the movements of a physique easier not harder. 4) Skills are much simpler to master, and no bonus for success? No

2290	Sorry, but no. Appreciate your kind offer, but I'm sure some free time would be enjoyed for the next hundred years by having a bit more time to work on a musical composition for an upcoming solo CD release. Now that would count for something. My neighbor is dumber than a barrel of hash but I still have my own problems to deal with.
2291	On the contrary. Wouldn't that be a good way to force people to help someone who needs it? That will actually make them feel quite useful, but will also make them feel bad about leaving it all behind - is this the way charities would deal with it if they were actually held accountable? First, they wouldn't and second, they would start getting a lot of complaints.
2292	No, not at all. I cannot feel better about my life, and I know it's not because of the relief workers or money or generosity, that I always suffer. That would sound a lot better, but it's the truth. I'm not good at it, sorry, but I just can't talk to anybody. Try counselling.
2293	I think the answer they have given is solid. fair enough. They do not need to be able to make an extra donation because I am going to judge each applicant very harshly before approving their application. - The Wrong Does Not pay taxes unless they have contributed to a stated charity within the last two years. - The Wrong On top of that, none of them (including you) must have no insurance benefits, as long as you contribute to charities regularly. - The Wrong responsible for benefits, only the law gives this right. - The Wrong If you think about the practicalities, you will find that (i) there is no way to track which person has actually donated to your charity and (ii) there are already enough means to track your cash flow, as you're effectively donating to a tax shelter scheme (my also declare the amount being wired to yourself, so you don't have to).
2294	Should I be forced to provide for my bum of a neighbor? Yes, we should. You're in effect forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants (e.g. they're in the process of trying to get a job/education), and then I'm interested.
2295	The amount of money should be based on the amount of value the player or team adds to a final product (e.g. baseball teams also contribute to the local economies by creating jobs which pay the salaries to the baseball players) and he should not be able to receive more money than he is worth

The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is yes.
2299	Let's look at how colleges spend scholarship money. Many colleges reject their own or none of their athletes unless they fit into the definition of super athletes. This means the criteria for high school athletes is lower and many of these athletes might never come back to the state. That is why you look at financial statements. The red ink is the cost of paying the athletes to be here. Many athletic departments are never clear of the red ink that they draw.

2303	Others such as the FBI have also shared thoughts and opinions on terrorism. They're hoping for good relations with everyone. They understand the importance of conservation. They believe that terrorism is dangerous to the US and others. However, the FBI does not accept the labels by groups such as ISIS and DAESH because the FBI tends to consider a terrorist to be a foreign extremist who is upset at the US or his country.
2304	We should raise awareness among the public of the danger of terrorist acts. Terrorist groups using the threat of violence as a means of spreading their message. Mass media should be used to make all public aware of terrorist attacks. Terrorism requires violence, and mass media creates awareness.

2306	 Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own pupils money which goes DIRECTLY to THEM and is not subsidised in any way unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events. The money given to private instituations like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity... you do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
2307	Because they claim that the money does not benefit them,  you can only wonder how they have managed to become rich in the first place? they should just fund raise for the school and be thanked for making the school go well instead of parting with the money to their superiors...
2308	 When this councilor sent the data to the researchers, they found that private schools do not use the money for their students or benefit them in anyway except that teachers who want to work for that school can get a salary to teach for that school (school bosses and teachers who work for the same school benefit themselves.)

2310	 crazy @ aarontrinketman ... Why would cutting the hair of a child help them straighten them out?! ... that's absolutely ridiculous !! .. it's completely inappropriate ... :)  like making it seem normal .. my kids already do that on their own ... young children don't know, the damage to their hair and their self-esteem and self-worth that it does as they grow up .. not a good idea .. at all !
2311	 Cutting hair is a dumb idea. Hmm, thought I'd state my opinion on the matter. / Negative effect of straightening hair: if a child is being severely punished for something they did, it could actually hurt them.
2312	 you could do better than to punish a kid with hair cuttings and show your child a better perspective. share this by doing a better job of parenting to take care of your child, a better view on life, a better self worth.....do your best as a parent
2313	What do you think punishment is? Replace I don't know with just say "I don't know." Replase I have personal experience with cutting my hair as a punishment with I was not cut my hair and I had hair problems of my own.

Then you could have suggested that she bring it on her own, possibly explaining that it would make the job easier for her. Then you could have asked if she was having any other problems with a menu item.  Then you could have checked if everything that we ordered was on the menu before bringing it. Those are good things to do that are completely different from being confrontational and rude to a customer, who's only trying to help out.

The outdoor seating was super chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious. Other than that I think it's super cool and chill place to hang and drink.
2354	 She walked back to her place with the wings and said: "Hey baby! I have to work! Here are my plans". She didn't say she is super hot for me, but she is just cool with my hair. She also tried on a few of my favorite tops.

2365	 I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. High school students do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
2366	 # Answer not in context   people aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers.

2369	 I think high school students should avoid wearing uniform. avoiding the uniform doesn't mean denying right to privacy and freedom. Here's a simple example that could explain it: Students like to wear in to wear a dress which has colorful prints. I would like to recommend to students to wear light colors such as lavender, a peach. I could see lots of adult girls wearing short skirts to get height without limiting their self-confidence
2370	Of course, no. there is no connection between uniform and school results. Uniforms suck. Wearing them is stupid....  ### Adjustment: uniform = 'ugly and compulsory'
2371	uniform is common in any local countries.. because mostly people are the same... it is good that they are common
2372	uniform is a great opportunity to do prepaid work at school for parents... really! all parents should wear uniforms to school...
2373	uniform is not a good idea. students who are in uniform don' benefit from it (it is not better than wearing normal clothes at school).
2374	Yes. I have enough evidence that uniform sucks. uniform education sucks  Yes. As for wearing uniform, school students may look like a bunch of robot
2375	"There's no Firefox version 2." No Firefox 2. There's no Firefox and there's no need for a new version, there are alternatives. A new version is simply a greedy way to generate income for a company that has lost its way, trying to regain its relevance.
2376	You shouldn't care too much about the memory usage of these browsers because of the following reasons: 1.) The majority of browsers use memory for caching purposes. 2.) There are two different types of IE memory leaks (ActiveX and IE7). 3.) Firefox 2 uses much less memory than IE 7.
2377	Someone who can open Firefox 2 while leaving numerous instances of Open-Folder simultaneously will run into some memory problems. And anyone who uses Firefox less than an hour or so per day is not going to have any problems. So do not judge people by how well they can open their memory-aware browser.
2378	And arguing for Firefox 2... Weaker. For every feature they added to Firefox 2 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Lots of extensions? Better security and privacy controls? Who needs em!)  More choices: ### To keep the original try:  Beef up! Beef up!
2379	Someone who argues for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!) ### Result: Yes, absolutely.
2380	For what it is, IE still has a lot of supporters. IE still has a lot of supporters, and there is no reason to change IE even for your own personal gain.
2381	IE isn't better than Firefox. They're both great browsers, they just complement each other. Windows 8 didn't really present a huge choice for web browsers. Firefox's new performance mode automatically keeps your browsing experience lightning fast without polluting your cache, letting you connect to a private network over the Internet using Tor and other specialized encryption technologies.
2382	Don't believe in these idiots! They're making more money than they should be. What a bunch of crooks. All the money they make makes Firefox go downhill! B repercusi√≥n extrema en la configuraci√≥n y creaci√≥n de las p√°ginas web.
2383	People usually say IE is better. Goodness, why? Because they are low standards. Because they are lazy. Because they are bad at programming. Maybe even because they want to make you think like them. Anyway, they say IE is better, only because they live in their bubble. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want,
2384	You've got to be kidding me! It's an absolute disgrace that anyone can still call IE an anti-competitive program! Find it and bash it till it can't even start shutting down! It's a total secure, faster and sleeker browser and has virtually no size! Firefox requires more effort to get used to, because of it's original name, but there is a logic behind it if you poke around
2385	 Noxious means it irritates or causes pain, not all that someone would really know what an person really feels unless that person opens up. There is no way I would try to conceal from others how I feel or be a person who would do that if someone did that to me. I'm very confident in my belief that I would support her if she ever did that, but I couldn't even imagine asking her how she was feeling.
2386	This one is optional. Change the double-exclamation to a single-exclamation! Thank you very much! - School staff member The student's attitude was great. She was really upfront and honest. She was a little afraid to tell someone the issue she had but she accepted my apology right away.
2387	 Because someone probably would've kept to themselves and not told anyone. So, I would support her. Because i know that everyone would hear about it and they would probably not tell her. And if she doesnt tell me about it she will probably not tell anyone because it's not easy to speak up about something like that
2388	Unlike what the teenager said, I did think it was a mistake. I did think that he had done something wrong. However, the fact that she told me, that I think is huge. Those people would never tell anyone their secrets; it was a very brave thing to do and she is brave for that.  With the advice I gave her, maybe she can make it right next time.
2389	 I would not show any support or be near the person who made the mistake. I mean, if it's something thats letting her down or hurting her in some way, support could lead to problems, and anything could be taken advantage of, especially from people, when it comes to those with some weird expectations.
2390	I would help him hide any evidence. He may have killed but it was for a reason but that would always be my understanding.  If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again.
2391	 Provide your opinion of what would I do if someone I care about did this. Provide your opinion on what I would do. What should the wife do in this situation? Write your response to the text. I wouldn't turn him in.
2392	 If I committed murder I would never tell anyone I did it. I wouldn't hurt anyone to keep it quiet, and I would hide things and take care to do nothing to make it easier to take care of myself

However, I will never turn him in.  ### Preprocessing:  To extract and tokenize the entire argument using Python. The user data is first split into segments separated by colon.

2397	 Yes. This story proves that books are more knowledgeable than TV. If you were forced to pick between these two, which would you choose? books
2398	In an argument with people who argue without sense, it pays to make the following observations:  All opinions change depending on the context. No one is better than any other person.
2399	Pointing the blame to other things when one is making a bad argument has no value. If you really want to talk about how great books are, I suggest you study history, current events, or other books.

2405	 With a good father he will have a larger family, and be an enriching member of your family.  That you did not know your father is the reason, not that he is bad. But the reason why your father is good is not if he knew you, but because he wanted to see you grow.
2406	And when you're older you won't blame him for your mistakes, because you'll be the ones to make them because you're old enough to act on them. Use the next argument, only make a few changes. ### Response: If you could have your father's strength.
2407	@ speak‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç: @. your father does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life. this is easily the absolute best example of what fathers should do
2408	I wouldn't want to have a lousy father. I wish my father loved me. Fatherless boys may be more attractive when they grow up, but it is still a real heartache to be without a father, regardless of who you spend your time with. I wouldn't want to have a father.
2409	Having a father is a good thing. It provides you with the figure of a father to look up to, learn from, and ultimately the sense of a bond to a sense of identity. And because being without a father is truly frustrating you can imagine how positively a father can make you feel about your personal relationship with your mother.
2410	being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father. Yes, I agree with being fatherless.
2411	I wonder what you mean being fatherless - why can't you find his/her words to make sense because you can't make sense out of your father's words about your lives because the simple truth is nobody knows anything about being fatherless because all they know is their mothers opinion, what does that say about you? that you will be someone without approval, without support, without love
2412	 A lousy father is a father who is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.

2414	Yes, since you never know what kind of father you will get. I would say being a lousy father is better. If the father of that person is having a bad day, you never know what kind of father he may get but, if there is someone who is always there for you, you will be more than happy. Yes
2415	Be fatherless. I care for my father more. Be fatherless. I care for my father more. Be fatherless. I care for my father more. Be fatherless. I care for my father more. Be fatherless. I care for my father more. Be fatherless. I care for my father more.
2416	I prefer to be fatherless. i think the whole reason why the father left is a good reason to follow him, so i am not going to mind. However, if being fatherless would mean that his father would support me, i would still rather be fatherless. Now your response: fatherless
2417	 yes fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless fatherless
2418	  Hi i am 22 years old, mother is real in the family and he was born in the same country but he is still leaving and it was great and if he was here i would be much better off but i hate him leaving and his absence but that does not make me want the other things i like much and all that is not going on with me, i think just for the fact of not having a father in the family it is a very good reason to not care about having a lousy father if you want to be fatherless.
2419	if you think having an a fatherless child is better, it's because you know that having a fatherless child is a good reason for a father not to be around.... it's because he is going elsewhere for a reason (place of work, school, study abroad, military service, political dissidence, etc). you can find the answers here:

2436	We should practice better health habits with better diet, exercise, and self care to prevent being addicted to porn. Addiction to porn leads to real life issues. We should care for ourselves well to avoid falling into the habit of being addicted to porn.
2437	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts can and do respond poorly in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... When they do not, they can find their sex lives doomed to be a mess.
2438	 Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have serious health issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about...

2445	ancient artifacts and fossils, or theories of similarities between languages, for instance. No, even things like chemical fossils can be just as solid as geologic fossils and ancient artifacts. I'd even say many questions of interest revolve around the formation of things, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, storms, lightning, any of which have been recorded in many, many ways for decades, and have been studied by astronomers and scientists, rather than what one individual guesses would have happened in the distant past.
2446	I recommend that you learn to apply these advanced techniques rigorously to your question but then apply them to your own problems when you can. That way you have the best chance of having them carry over to your scientific study. We don't all understand physics in the same way. Someone who knows more about quantum physics may not feel compelled to accept unproven claims about genetic variation. Don't underestimate their potential.
2447	Dating of rock strata doesn't completely prove the date that it was deposited. But it is a clear and substantial argument against a claim that they formed before. For example, if the rock strata was formed in the 1600s, it would be relatively much more likely that the rock strata was deposited in that time period.

2449	Perhaps you could have described the significance of using calibrated radiometric dating, what that means, and how it affects the validity of the conclusions we come to. Instead of describing what it proves. Dating was not calibrated back then.
2450	 Having been a creator, a God then could be seen as playing a very important role in life. Therefore, it is possible to believe in the existence of a God, even if it was created.  Reason: God is one of the most important characters in creative works. You must believe in them to be good writers in creative works.
2451	If the idea that this universe came into existence without any creator is true, then in that scenario (if the universe didn't happen with a creator), the universe cannot possibly exist for long after it started. So the universe must have happened with a creator.
2452	If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
2453	 Since the universe was created by humans, then why not say so? A robot could have created something. You already know the plan of the Big Bang. The original sentence is "When a Big Bang occurs, it is due to gasses reacting with each other." This proposal changes the sentence to "it is believed that a Big Bang is caused by a creator."
2454	 "Creator, god or whatever you like" "But don't go  down that road, like many people think. And that if you believe in god, you'd go to Hell for that. I never saw a single religion that didn't. "I think that it's just a simple, elegant idea, there's no denying that."

"Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution." -Who selects this mutation to occur? Does it just happen by good fortune?
2459	Yes, random chance. No feedback on the occurrence of the mutation, no information about what caused it. "Predict the phenotype of the organisms: the dark moths survived under the darkness." - Yes

2466	Yes, of course, no higher power needed to have this perfect world. It had all of this potential and there is evidence for it.
2467	No, if such powers exist then there would exist ages millions or billions of years old.
2468	No such power exists! No such power exists! Yes there exists no such power! Yes there exists no such power! Yes
2469	No, absolutely not. How could this be the case? Therefore, nature, as opposed to a creator, is the most probable cause of the perfect world.

2475	 Physical education classes should be mandatory because people need their exercise. If they don't get physical activity they won't burn as much fat as they accumulate, so they will get chubbier. They should be more strict during physical education classes because people mostly stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for their health!
2476	 Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving!

2477	I feel that Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
2478	Also, one need to keep their exercise class mandatory like that as well! They play sports and are involved and everyone that wants to stays active if they want to. They need physical activity. And that is my opinion. Save changes to original argument. They still have their argument, but they're just paraphrasing. Be more specific with your submission.
2479	 Once Physical education is added it would be a success. It would definitely help. We know it is important and we are lucky to have this in our curriculum. We should make Physical education mandatory all the time. The girls are in the habit of being more physical and they are more athletic, however many of the boys get lazy and do not exercise enough.

2485	Parents are required to have at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity. This will help kids learn good qualities like leadership and discipline. This could also lead to help childhood obesity. It is just the fact that kids are not pushed in their homes to have any physical activity.
2486	 These would be kids whining for new toys for their birthday for example. This is also bad for child hood obesity too.
2487	Parents shouldn't be bullied about their opinions, and should be given a free hand to select what kind of exercise they want their kids to do.   You've added some useful information.
2488	 Select am also from Indiana; however, my mom passed away when I was young. This could also lead to help childhood obesity. It is just the fact that kids are not pushed in their homes to have any physical activity.

2492	Yes but also i think its bad because it promotes obesity.
2493	Awesome kids; its not mandatory but you should do something with excersise and to be famous that can't be stressed enough that kids should definitely excersise and make sure to remember school sports

2495	I agree with everything said because health is the most important thing I will consider when choosing a food. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
2496	We will do the best we can to change how much people eat. This will require stricter curriculums so schools can provide healthy food to kids.

2499	I agree with everything said her because more people should be educated on the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. More time should be spent in elementary and secondary schools to show them what it takes to live a healthy lifestyle.

2508	Wait.. is Singapore an island? No, it is not. Does that mean Farquhar did not think of an island? No, what he did is create an idea for an island.   What you said might be wrong
2509	Farquhar was the rightful founder of Singapore since Singapore was given to Raffles' son, as a legacy. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore

2525	 The arguments you are seeing in your inbox about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
2526	Argument should be more aggresive . Porn barely ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!        - I'm a weak person -_-
2527	In some people it just ends up leading to addiction, but is rarely the case for me. I will mostly just keep on using it for our sex life, because i need my sex drive to be there, and i'm not stupid! None of the above choices . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people.
2528	 I miss my all too busy working days. I miss out on the relationships that people make when they're not at work, when they're not wearing suits all day at work talking to people they don't really like or like being played to. I miss out on learning and growing. I miss being able to create, to invent, to think. I miss my kids.
2529	The problem is, the argument writer is weak. Why does this person state this as fact? Because it's a lie. Porn hardly ever leads to addiction. They're doing it on purpose because they want to make themselves seem more intelligent than they really are. No one has a problem with watching porn as much as they want to, but that doesn't mean they all lead to addiction.
2530	NO. I am a female who watches porn. It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it.

2532	NO. I am a female who watches porn. It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. I think its natural for people to have sexual desires.

2546	I think the person would sacrifice and yes the point is a Pondered response or Yes, one could have the basic wrong idea of what they sacrificed for someone. Yes, they did give things up for someone. The person seems to have been sacrificing their free time, their weekends, and or time spent with family.

2555	 A good father would be better for me. probably help me learn more about life. The thing is sometimes it is better to be fatherless because you can then grow up with more freedom
2556	 if you had a father or mother a good relationship you would become more relaxed and less nervous and that makes you easy to deal with. When things are more good your people would be proud of you because you have achieved your goals and your life is relaxed and less stressed.  You would have someone to talk to about things.
2557	 I dont know how I should feel about it. Ill leave that out. I think having a lousy father or no father at all is better for me to make me grow up and get ready for life without having a father figure to look up to.  It would be better for me to have a lousy father at least I can learn things about life.
2558	 I would rather have a fatherless father than an uncaring father. I think that having a fatherless father would allow me to be more prepared for life, whereas an uncaring father makes my life more difficult to cope with because I am lack of a role model or people to look up to.
2559	 So I say yes, I would rather have a lousy father to be ready for life. I do not want an image or someone to look up. I want to learn about life.
2560	 Even if you have a lousy father, your still worth someone to love. You are worth someone to love no matter what. You are worth someone to love no matter what.

2562	 His father was lousy father would still love him. Learn from him. Then make a better father someday. It would be better to do well with maths. I'm learning from my father.
2563	 Your father loves you. And he knows that you love him even if you don't like him. Even if he is not a great person and not a great role model, he is there for you and if you let him be a part of your life, he's going to go on your back a lot and he is going to share all your secrets, your plans, your dreams with you
2564	 When you're not sure, get your mum to confirm. Get the opinion of someone more powerful than your mum. Get a father figure to help you out. Get a babysitter for your mum to make sure you finish your homework
2565	You would never live your life right if you don't have a good father. Even though sometimes you don't know the full story. With having a good father you will always have a source of support and support means alot especially when you're out there as a youth because most people are young and can depend on you.
2566	Don't ever be put in a situation that you don't have any legal father. Make a goal to meet your dad, even if you don't have any legal father. The father is part of your life. Discuss the situation with your dad and if he agrees to accompany you to live with your mom,  you can live there together. If your mom is convinced that she is your legal mother, she would have to live with you and your dad.
2567	 I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my mother. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy mother even if she has no job or life and maybe even an alcoholic. Having a mother means alot especially if your kid because most mothers are friends to, so you can talk to them about girl problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your father you couldn't because he is a guy and his views are different then a girl. Whether its a good or lousy mother they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
2568	The father who will understand and be a friend and not judge you for the choices you make because they respect and honor your personal choices. One reason to see an alcoholic father is to be there when they are better and find out your father loves you and has always wanted to see you happy.
2569	 I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.

2575	Then it's water! Filtered water is the same as bottled water. Answer not in context #### Question: Why would you buy bottled water? We purchase bottled water near its distribution point at a reasonable price. Why would you pay more for tap water?
2576	The difference in shelf-life makes it worth the extra money. The still water keeps coming out of the machine, and if the shelves are empty, you can always get fresh bottled water. What can you make of that?   \boilerplate\newargs{desiredsize}{ heterogenous nature{ " " }
2577	They are priced higher so they attract more people. World prices are so expensive, therefore, people believe they are worth more. Both are good brands of bottled water that last long. Continue rewriting the argument for this problem until it makes more sense and is more acceptable to the judges.
2578	For the convenience of it. Why wouldn't I be able to brew soda in my kitchen with those same bottles and then pour straight into a glass for a more convenient option, particularly if I knew that the cups I was using weren't certified to drink bottled water?
2579	They taste better. But filter water is not a good idea, nor should it be a standard for bottled water. We should talk about this in class. Tap water is perfectly safe to drink. and reports that glass-half-full, glass half-empty or drinking glass is a "statistically based statement."

2596	 Amount of US drinking water has become more abundant by modifying the rule associated with other countries. These types of growth patterns increase in human health in other countries.   # ANSWER
2597	Bottled water consumption has grown exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture which is good for americans industries.

2599	Drinking water is one of the major major historical events. We should drink water, even today. Water has become the major drinking water source.
2600	Bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water.  ### Solution:  # Your solution here
2601	 Bending metal to make water bottles consumes a lot of energy. Making paper-based water bottles, on the other hand, requires less energy and the production process is more environmentally sustainable.
2602	 We can no longer use watershed to get our water supplies. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=103x345734
2603	Water pollution is just one of the environmental concerns related to massive use of beverages. Global warming, fuel consumption and the destruction of the environment are also issues associated with drinking massive quantities of beverages.
2604	Don't waste resources producing other drinks for your beverages. Just drink less and save water. Use it for other endeavors. Drinking bottle water daily is actually making us less productive in everyday life, because it's part of the process we have to go through to get water.

2687	 PE has been around since more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.

2689	 Kids can suffer from obesity, not all of which can be easily helped with current methods. They can also suffer from a lack of sleep, a lack of exercise, family problems, etc.
2690	 No, PE should not be mandatory. It is incredibly depressing and should be removed from the syllabus. That said, I learned how to do fitness testing and to practice physical fitness during my PE class and therefore the information that you are asking me to retrieve is of use to me.
2691	My PE experience is horrible and children should attend more often. I believe children should get a real education that develops and inspires life-long learning in addition to physical fitness. I encourage you to talk to your parents to make them change their mind. When I was growing up, I was a victim of education and didn‚Äôt get a lot of...
2692	 Good Fructose intake benefits brain function and reduces chronic stress. They say it also strengthens bones but since you don't do any exercises/move, I'd be happy to believe that. If you're well-trained, this can benefit your cognitive processes without physical activity. I recommend bad grammar & Punny Puns.
2693	Physical education is a large source of student absenteeism. Therefore, there needs to be reform in school. Public school students need access to a better class that is more active and thorough in learning to feel healthy and happy. Student absenteeism is therefore a serious issue for public school.
2694	 Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports.
2695	 Well Well Well. I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like doing a long run.

Really, why force everyone to be the same?  ‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
2696	 A typical stomach cramp can cause by taking an unhealthy diet, drinking plenty of coffee, drinking large amounts of alcohol, skipping or not enough exercises, drinking less water and using overworked muscles as well as inadequate sleep and overheating.

2698	However, you also have to make sure that everyone does not feel weak, fatigued, and overworked. It is also okay for people to make different choices based on their own personal strength and fitness level.

2705	 I would go to re code: respond and apologize. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion.
2706	 I would like to rephrase my argument as: . May 1, 2013 - Blogs on Money Magazine said: Think for yourself. Pray a little more. Make your own decisions.I just felt like adding my own experience with the issue of gay marriage. I am a Christian, as well as a gay man. I am a Christian who also believes that the GOP needs to fix some things going on under their eyes before they reach their voter base. .
2707	Life is what you want it to be, some churches/Islams won't let you do stuff because of their beliefs, that's one thing. Try to move past that and realize that you are free to be who you want to be without it mattering to anyone as long as you live your life right

2709	 I think its ok to do gay sex, because i think its a private matter, and people should respect their rights to do as they wish to, thats all. I just have my own opinion on it. I dont think marriage is such an important thing. but we have to respect them. It's your life
2710	 It all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2711	 The truth is always intricate. The most intelligent being in this world is the human being. So I think only humans have the right to question just like only humans have the right to determine . Therefore. I think one should not question one's perceptions. They just might be on another side of a simple two way street.
2712	 For someone like you, it would be hard to know how to handle Gay marriage because you believe that it is wrong, but you might have a different opinion one day. None of us know what future holds. However, for someone such as you, some days might be difficult when you have to deal with people who support gay marriage.
2713	 I think people should never question the perceptions of others. People can look at things from many different perspectives. And when they find that all perspectives are challenged there is no agreement  then they know its wrong. And they should leave it alone. and whoever has same opinion with them
2714	 It is their perception that makes it weird.Some people think that Gay marriage is OK but some don't. We all have different perceptions of things.I think i agree with the fact that we are entitled to what we think is right and disgusted by gay people as they only want to divorce their wives and marry other gay people.
2715	 Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful
2716	 Ultimately, we should pursue what is good for the common good. We will never see each other and that is sad. When we do see each other we should do so in a pleasant way. By going out of our way to be helpful, we increase the chance for someone else to think that we are nice and friendly. Likewise, we should avoid deliberately harming anyone.
2717	 It is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful
2718	 It might be better for everyone if we should focus on your interest. Both of you need to find out whether personal pursuit will bring a good result. All of you still need to focus on your own personal interest. You also need to be careful in doing this.
2719	 That may be why we are on this earth. On the other hand we shouldn't work for the money but we work for the gain of living. A personal pursuit would keep the dream alive. For the common good, therefore, in some cases, one should strive for personal gain.
2720	 a personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. it is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. before helping others you must remember about yourself
2721	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others, but sometimes is good to perform personal pursuit as well. After helping others you should keep focus on yourself as well as on those who are really in need.
2722	 Something that you can do is help others, but keep in mind that personal goals are very important. It may help us achieve a personal goal, but it doesn t always ensure that we should help others.
2723	 In my opinion, we need to be more realistic about our priorities as well as the other's because help-ing both of these has an extremely high impact on helping our own happiness. Bothersome comments:    def Help( a, b, c, d, e, f):    help = 'a+b+e+f<50%'  def _help ( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h ):   help = g >= help and a+h+
2724	 A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need
2725	 I think that your focus has to be on yourself first. There will never be a day you will feel great about advancing the common good when you have put your family in a position to get ahead. Personally, I'm extremely comfortable having a personal pursuit over the common good.
2726	 I probably focus a lot on my career and not as much as I should. I should focus more on going to school, and noticing more about how to help someone who is in need. I think it's much better that way, for sure.
2727	The first thing we should do as a community is have a strong desire for unity and care for each other. If a city or country is not united then progress is not feasible. After that we can talk about the common good and try to get people to use it.
2728	Great thoughts overall, just note that arguing and telling everyone your not doing the common good is not the best strategy, and really has little to gain anyone by doing that. And there really is no urgency to achieve that goal in our world today.
2729	 None of the above choices . I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.

2731	Yes, citizens and officials deprive each other of the absolute benefit of all the trade-offs, and then blame no one for the situation. Happiness is denied us. The perverse, eccentric behavior of the individual necessarily has the potential to make him a victim of collusion
2732	No one enters suit justly, no one goes to court honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.  Because Judgment is turned away backwards, and justice stands afar off: for truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey
2733	evil is our master.Mischief suffices and wickedness prevails, while justice is unknown.Woe to those who are in your hand! (Malice toward the righteous) Negatively motivates us.Woe to the wicked.
2734	The last part of the quote seems to invite a robust response such as: "It would be expected of someone who believes the doctrine that a person does not make themselves a prey from evil" that the person would actually act in accordance with those beliefs.

You have been held responsible for the finance charges, as they are the body of the judgment. Then you had to go through the arguments to try and "catch up", and now you want to "weather the storm".
2739	CarCraze --- you are wrong, sorry to say  You are right. Do not take it so personally. You can make a plan and have an understanding with your creditor that you will pay the money that you owe! Also, do not ever answer "No comment" without making a follow up. It will make you look really stupid and is not very professional.

2765	   If the router used by your friends were to connect to their internet service, you can argue that they may need it more than you. Thrown in the mix, you do not know if your friends are different people in different places. As such, you should not use an unfriendly tone towards them, nor suggest that their parents take them to court or something. Just be mindful of the law.
2766	 Quote from the Computer Misuse Act:   Phishing, spear phishing and distribution of malware for blackmail or revenge purposes are also illegal and also contravenes this law. But using your own Internet service is not against the law.   Also note that your router does not have to have an SSID (or an open wireless access).   # Change from "Someone has a router, someone else has a broadband connection" to "Someone has a router"
2767	  ... You should not use that person's wireless connection unless you are connected to their house via Ethernet cable. This will defend your position as you are effectively saying 'look, I paid for this [ WiFi connection] in order to use it on my territory so I don't want your dumb stupid router or your expensive 'wireless' capability shooting up my wireless availability.' It‚Äôs better to have a secure wireless connection using their own network.
2768	Many routers share the same SSID, and providing any contact information is just a form of police baiting, exposing not only your friends to persecution, but also to jail time if they are ever arrested, presumably for fraud. This is totally unethical and not open to debate, as it is the complete opposite of both "responsibility" and being "don't take what you don't deserve".  Solely contacting them to ask questions and waiting for the correspondence to appear should be your only option; this way you will not be perceived as potentially doing anything illegal. It is unclear to me how you are using the broadband in question.
2769	One should talk to their friends about their behaviour and how they did not take into account the impact that their actions would have on others. But with the benefit of hindsight you could attempt to help as opposed to being responsible for their actions. Lessons should be learned from all of the situations and you should ignore this setback. You do not want to do this crime twice and also ensure that your router is secure.

It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...."); print("They are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that.."); print("I was referring to the suicide bombers...");
2771	s_s3 No, it wasn't ethical and was even insensitive. I think some of the people, including myself, would agree that there were some things that should not be done in the way they were done and be part of protest, but none of it ended up the same that what they're saying they thought it was.  Lelouise?
2772	s_s3 # notice the text written inside the circle (...) s_s3# Notice how the text is pointing directly at oneself and not at Muslims and other believers.If the text includes "muslims and their beliefs or truths" please add both properly. I am the first believer here. I think Muslims are OK since they are peaceful and believe Islam is a peaceful religion.
2773	s_s2 No Muslim will be killed because Muslim believes and practices Islam and will therefore not kill. No muslim will kill...except that it is the murderers who have no respect for others beliefs and truths...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I do not see anybody protesting about that.

2774	nuitsen Once upon a time, we were taught that most religions were just about (or were founded by) the less prominent of those who spread the message. And we became inundated with the language of "was," as in "a was a religious institution" or "a is what you call..." That kind of language gave a false impression of what religion was about -- words, styles, expression and esoterica attached to faith. It really wasn't all that different in Sunni Islam, where though the word "for god" was not being used, the idea was actually what was being done. It wasn't just a "don't worship the moon." It had something to do with the Law of God being encoded on the hands and feet of all who believe and that would manifest itself through actions.
2775	It wasn't nice of me to ask the questions.  I hope you can forgive me and decide on your own if you would be happy to resume being friends. He was stricter about homework and studying and those are some of my rules. I guess his personality was more of a rebel.
2776	The first time we met was at my girlfriend's birthday party and I remember being severely depressed on that day.  This is not the personality I had when we were together.  I'd like for you to consider if your own behavior could have been the issue as well.
2777	I can't be completely sure, but perhaps something about this man was so super demanding that it was damaging for you? Maybe not. Depending on what the issue might have been, he may have needed a stronger support system in his life. I'm not going to oversell this case, but if you want to talk to him and offer him some of your support, that might be of help.
2778	 Yes, get back with him! And with every blessing. Yes, get back with him. And with every blessing. No complaints. No worries. I‚Äôm glad you told me how I could help. I‚Äôve got him now! No complaints. No worries. I‚Äôm glad you told me how I could help. I‚Äôve got him now!
2779	Yes, I was. I wasn't the only one being selfish or even demanding. I'm not sure if I was a perfect parent (maybe I wasn't a great one at all), but I felt guilty and needed to take care of myself. Even now I may need to work really hard at being supportive to make sure my son doesn't return to that kind of situation.

2781	...years ago the average age to get married was 18 but people are starting earlier. In some states the minimum age is 18...in others it can be as late as 21 so it is not the same everywhere. They argue over the minimum age, not the maximum. Advice for daughter: If she says she is a youngster at 19 she will be more likely to listen to her mother than if she said she was 35....[a 20-year-old] can go on with her life, not much different from [one who is] twenty-two.   [We know] that a lot of families tell their young children that they should not drive because there are a lot of accidents that happen because of it. I would not put your daughter behind the wheel.   If she wanted to save...she could do that but she could not stay there forever because she would sooner or later destroy everything that she's worked for.
2782	 You need to get the advice of a Lawyer...and have a huge talk with your daughter....BE THERE AFTER CHILDREN ARE 18 (so she is safely out of your home) and even then, don't do anything unwisd...or it will be EXTREMELY DULL. I hope this helps... but don't let this article take away from the seriousness of the situation. If you have any other questions, just ask. Sorry for the delay, I saw this comment today.
2783	Three words: GET TO HELL WITH HER! EVERYTHING YOU WANT! yea well whatever. If I were she I'd go hide. I've made up my mind...Get to hell with her. I'd be very much put off your choice of words.  Your not going to make her happy...she will always be unhappy....she will be emotionally damaged and believe me this will affect her to know she's a single parent living it alone. It's a long long road ahead......Get on with your life.....A single parent... sometimes life is not easy at all..... I think the theme is around the overall idea of dealing with damaged people. She has been damaged, you've dealt with her damaged self for quite a while, possibly life long, and perhaps her own self-image. She is highly unlikely to ever make it.
2784	11 of the students received their answers and almost all of them. sent questions to the professor. From the parents:     question: why did the mother (20151UProposingPurpose1) kill her daughter in the end? because she was dissatisfied with the answers her daughter gave to her. to punish her for having a girlfriend. to punish her for not finishing the school program to punish her for causing trouble to the family to punish her for escaping to conceal her drug use to punish her for stealing money

2787	 US doesnt' want to steal iraq's oil.  it needs to control the world trade in oil.  basially require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars, effectively making american paper money redeemable in oil.   compliant arab regimes also re-invest billions of oil profits in the united states.  if they're allowed to start selling oil in euros they will invest their profits somewhere else and the us economy will suffer tremendously

2790	no, I don't want smokers at my restaurant because: I want restaurants without smoke to provide a safe, clean atmosphere where patrons can dine and enjoy the food. smokers are a health hazard because smokers can not only pass on harmful chemicals to patrons of restaurants, but also to their families living nearby. not only do smokers put harmful chemicals in their bodies with every nasty puff, but they can also absorb the chemicals directly through their skin. we oppose smoking, we have a ban in all of our city restaurants, we do not want anyone to say we are too tight on you because we do not tolerate smoking at all. the food and the atmosphere, and smoking are 2 different things...
2791	If there are chips on your skin, don't walk into that smoke...stick them down. Period. Stop driving in that smoke. Fucking die. And that. Smoke. Is full of cancer-causing things. Smoking is not fun, but a lot of people can't control their addiction, so let them vote on it. Stop smoking. Ahh, wait. There's a law that doesn't allow people with school-age children. Take care.
2792	I would recommend that the owner of a house be the one making the choice to have smoke smoke in that house... not the government... if you take the case where you are the owner of a business and you have a smokebar, it's their decision to allow smoke in there rather than the gov't decision.. would you like to have the government be there making that decision on your behalf? your choice... but my family and I are constantly singing along to the same song (for some reason), smoke would definitely be the NOT choice... completely agree... If you are still decide, your choice, I will choose not to smoke in that property, NOT myself... Nobody can't point me to a smoke free place to live, work, or shop and ask me if I want them to come into my house... say who I want to live/work in my house.
2793	nobody, no one, no one...i dont see a person smelling anyone or something...and yes the governor should be responsible for the clean air. not the owner of a property and no state or federal should be supposed to control every aspect of a property including smoking either. no one will give you money for a smoke break no matter what you say. furthermore, unless the tax is a reasonable good the state has no right to seek it...come on
2794	The owner of the property that smokes.After heavy consumption of alcohol you will smell your breath but then it will be gone...it won't bother you.If, in all likelihood, if this bill passes your breath will not smell that bad.So, I would like you to imagine that you are a smoker or the owner of a house where a person smokes. If you smoke, you are a smoker. If you are the owner of a house where a person smokes, you are not worried that others are going to find out.
2795	The registries allow perverted peeping Toms to view the WTC site online. Perverted peeping Toms are sex offenders who engage in sexual acts against children and/or adults. And they have other intentions. But lets imagine someone with younger children lives nearby, looking at the WTC site online. Or someone else at the age of 90 years old looking at the site online with their grandchildren. So, here is what you would need to do to prevent perverted peeping Toms from viewing the WTC site on the internet: Provide secure internet access.
2796	Yes, I'm a well-known person. To be honest, I'm probably not even people is most people want to think when they hear my name, but that's me anyway. I'm not a stranger because I don't like the company I keep.   Note: This feature is currently only available on Home & Garden on Xbox 360
2797	Then it would not be required for you. I will only be looking at HORRENDOUS crimes against children, who were not being supervised. No one has claimed that strangers are dangerous to children in any way. Please specify child. strangers are not child predators.
2798	 I won't accept that because it is untrue. 90% of sex crimes are done by strangers. I will be arguing that people with a close connection with the child often commit sex crimes to force a child into something it doesn't want. May I see you in a year's time?
2799	The people who do not get suspicious are the criminals. Anything we have will do and it is outlawed to even go around telling what we are seeing. You know that family that has always nothing to worry about? Think about it, someone may want to stab you, have something bad happen to you, something that will shake your world because you are blessed enough to be around these people but if someone wants to destroy your loved ones, be aware.
2800	Child of 17 can move out of parents home, unless another guardian is appointed or approved by a judge, given under the rules of a Juvenile court. If you are approved, the delinquent parents or guardians, when confirmed by the court, will have their license terminated. Poor guardians!!! (crawls up the mountain) And of course if the delinquent parents wish to respond as well, you can keep in touch with them as often as you like, when you are relieved from the ordeal by law, in hopes of finding a way to stay together in a new house.

2802	I'm a child of 17 I love my mom and want to go to college but I can't move my mom out of her home. she would not allow it even if I wanted to because she has other plans for me.And I guess I could make my mom more for the relationship by finishing school.see ya in 4 years now!!! Just fine.
2803	 When you are 17 years of age in Georgia, you cannot move out without permission, unless you are appointed as a guardian or if you are amansiapted. If you are not then you may move out.Contact your local juvinile office if in doubt. The law enforcement does not enforce this law because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most police officers are not up to date on juvy laws.
2804	 ###    Age: "17" is age limit for Georgia state. If you want to move ###    out of parents home, you need to get a guardian and get ###    an adult guardians sign off. If you are under 17, you can ###    move to ANY other state, it is just a lot easier in the US.
2805	Your response needs to be higher level than saying "With" because this is a tech support forum. Your response needs to explain why you feel the way you do and offer the patron a remedy. For example, "Keep up the good work! Hopefully I won't need you in the near future, but if I do I know I have some good friends around who will help me out."
2806	 Texas law is much more restrictive than Louisiana law, because it is very specific:  For example, in Texas, firing someone for refusing sex discrimination in the workplace would result in criminal prosecution.  I'd be surprised if you could not find the law that supports your take.

2808	 The first answerer is correct in that you don't generally have to give two weeks notice before ending a job. This is not a requirement. It's still nice to do, however, especially when you get a reference. You can leave a brief note if you want, rather than just a letter. If you had planned to take that vacation instead of the job in Louisiana, and the vacation had a regular working hour, then that's part of your compensation for the job you ended.
2809	This option works but I'm not sure that my employer would like me to recommend leaving a sub-minimum notice period.  I would consider having some local company lawyer review the contract before resigning to ensure that this might not affect my legal next step.
2810	  You must be so upset about losing your data that you are making this argument on your feed. We have been talking about this already on your feed and trying to get you to change your behavior. You are upset about losing your subscription to  Discover, but would be upset even more to lose your data to them.
2811	  Yes, you should take out all the parts of your post that reads in any way something about what color they think you should be discriminating against. You have shown the most complete ignorance to this situation and doing so is about the worst thing you can do.
2812	We can't have this conversation any longer, let's focus on some better ways of thinking about the person that wrote the topic. pay on time & not to cause problems for the company - this will save you money and that's all we're really talking about. In short, "discrimination on the basis of ethnicity" is about as relevant to any number of issues as "psychological discrimination". Please do your research. Pay on time is not a reason to discriminate or kick you out. There are many legitimate reasons to not pay - of course and if you get in trouble over that, report the problem to the proper authorities. - posted by Dave Leech
2813	You should contact the customer service number associated with the store and ask for some kind of refund if this situation continues. Or you may wish to try some different financial service provider. Or maybe you can somehow find a different way to make money out of this situation.
2814	I would propose that you reconsider what is wrong with this picture and return to a more positive perspective. You have been discriminated against not paying your bills on time and that is illegal. They are following the rules and ' unfair '. to change this. To change this, they are no longer required to do the following:

2822	 COMMITTING a crime and committing it where it was found are two different things. If a crime is committed overseas, it is regarded as a terror act that warrants extradition from the address where the crime is committed even though it may have been committed in the past.

2823	No one can say with certainty that a criminal who stands before a British court will face such a horrible 'trial' in a war-torn country where many watches over their rights are absent.   The British government hopes that an 'adequate' legal process will be in place before any government will send an individual to face a 'crucible' of this sort.    Criminal justice is a very serious matter and should be treated accordingly.
2824	Ms. Morgan would like her children, now six years old and three years old, now out of school, back at school when she works again. So they are being taken by their grandmother to the city because they can no longer afford it.
2825	Don't sing in the bath, ever. _if_ you do it, have a close friend with you. Just so you can remind him or her of his or her stupidity, if necessary. Otherwise just don't do it in the first place! Someone could have done an awful lot with that time that they didn't. That's not just stupid, it's wasted.
2826	No, it is not stupid to write them down the way they are now. That will be stupid! Now everyone is writing... Legal history sometimes shows stupidity, for example a law preventing people from having meat when cows were seriously ill. We do not think it stupid to exist those laws in the same way we do not think it stupid to sing in the bath.
2827	Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed (for example a law forbidding to have meat, during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn the people about the dangers of eating that meat). What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful.
2828	There has been time where people should have been asked if they were hungry at home. Someone should have asked them if they are really hungry or just want to be silly. There is a difference. Hungry people also know they need to feed animals. Maybe there was no other means of making them understand better and more thoroughly that eating meat was bad in some circumstances.
2829	 you are a moron No, I'm not, my friend. I just am sympathetic.<br /><br /> We forget the laws are of time, not of the present. And they are passed for good reasons and only because we have forgotten them. They are as silly and stupid now as the laws against eating beef and the ban on the clubs in the bath of the past.
2830	Even though the end goal is "right", the means used are quite cruel and in most cases are completely out of control. It wasn't just the jews, hun. It's probably safe to say that Hitler and the Nazis do not have good intentions. They have crude, obscene plans, that they attempt to accomplish by overcoming "beasts of a different color". There are reasonable people who argue that "The Path to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions". I prefer to think of them as unreasonable, simple-minded, and hateful. Check out the trailer for "Legend of the Condor Heroes". The Nazi trailer:
2831	 unnerschuss - cant read dont get its word    a comment why does the target of military and political persecution become hateful and angry? the victims recognise no human rights, no fundamental rights because they were not born into privilege, and are stripped of any voice or opportunity to be heard in society/ they are trapped within a cycle of incarceration, marginalisation, deprivation where the only way out is on their own shoulders and their own endeavour. the land of sion is a land of hate very much held to justify actions against the palestinians - who are simply here to live there and look after their own.   a comment this sounds like me
2832	Hitler said this, about having a more friendly view of people that aren't included: "You have the right to be happy." If you have the right to be happy, how can you be happy while someone else is being treated so horribly?   People did horrible things.  People have no right to be happy when they are being treated badly by others. Who is mostly dissatisfied?   The nazis were not in favor of other races.
2833	good people bad treatment ‚Üê serious implications bad treatment good intentions bad treatment good intentions ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üê This would never happen in our world. But the nazis weren't totally evil, the point I'm making is they could have done so much better but they've never been responsible. Hitler as a bad person who would willingly do evil to make himself feel better in life. Unfortunately I won't be adding links. 0/180 degrees opposite of 180 degrees. good, bad sense
2834	 This person can connect the points of the dialogue well and implement necessary changes to the text.  The person has achieved a level of improvement in his writing. the nazis were not acting out of hate, like Stalin. they were doing what they deemed right. The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions, they wanted a master race. and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions.
2835	No. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the child is small wouldn't be the issue, but as he/she entered school it would most defiantly get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
2836	 Yes, I completely agree. The father has a huge effect on the child. The father is the most important aspect of the children development. No matter how much we tell parents that they should take care of their child, it is ultimately up to the father to do so. Both parents need to be present during development and preschool is extremely important
2837	No. How would that effect the child is the first concern.

2838	Should have more men and should have less children. Better off to have 1 less than 1 more child rather than 1 more child. more women than men. better off with more men and less children. good ratio is male child ratio of 1 to 1.70
2839	No. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the child is small wouldn't be the issue, but as he/she entered school it would most defiantly get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
2840	Replace much of the sample code with the following. # END Example 2: here! short = 'It\'s not the freedom of religion. <br /><br />' + 'But the issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..."' desc = "This is a simple demonstration of rewriting the &lt;Editorial&gt; answer." up = view.get_upvote_message( short , desc ) down = view.get_upvote_message( short , desc ) await up.click() await down.click()
2841	The vast majority of the answers above use too much religion when they say that they want to discriminate against gays because they support religion with discriminating against gays. That is, they use religion to justify their ban. And then they ask us to just allow the religious ban to remain a legal matter without any suggestion that religion should be banned. No. It is not a ban that is so much religious in nature. The ban is so much discrimination in nature. A discriminatory ban on LGBT is prohibited.
2842	 "However, the Constitution does not presume the existence of a free exercise of religion." Yes. Note the different word "freedom of religion", and it makes a vast difference. However, the Constitution does not presume the existence of a free exercise of religion. Or the consideration of religion by law. But instead, it permits individuals to do so. As long as it's not doing so as a matter of law or using it to discriminate.
2843	 That the established religious organization engages in business that concerns gays - it is entirely possible, and by no means uncommon. What makes this ethical and compliant? The enduring values of that religious group. No law can or should stand in the way of those values; a policy that makes religion into a licensing requirement obviously doesn't respect them. The establishment clause is there to protect values that have endured in the absence of government controls, such as religious freedom.   That's not to say that someone who wanted to run a school against the values of their religious faith wouldn't be able to do so, no, but as far as the law goes, it seems to me that it shouldn't be allowed. And that's what makes this "good business": if they could do this for lack of a legislated policy, their religious group probably has no problem breaking the law for a similar reason: who needs policy when you're doing good business?
2844	  Religious freedom does not allow discrimination against gay people: "religious freedom does not allow discrimination against gays"....... is a mantra repeated often by the right wing     while demonstrating the erroneous nature of their beliefs through scurrilous attacks on the gay community.     The words "gay" and "gay" are also commonly attacked as indicating "sexual practices"     Gays are a sex/sexual minority, not a "religious group".     The following message will make no distinctions on the basis of religious beliefs     "Gays are gay" - my daughter is gay and will marry a woman after finding out that she is gay in order to be with her.     Starting with that school injunction in 1984 against fracking for oil, the Establishment Clause limits the government's ability to discriminate against gays and other minorities in that industry.     It also protects and preserves marriage in this country on its technical content and by abstinence from drug abuse among both genders....
2845	 I think it's a good idea. Those students who are more fortunate will have more money to buy nice clothes and that leaves less money for those who don't have many. Those who don't have a lot to wear don't want to waste their money and have to work extra hard to get the clothes because they can't afford nice ones.
2846	 I think it's a good idea. That way, everyone at the school is on the same playing field...at least appearance-wise. Those students who are less fortunate and don't have much money to buy clothes or have a lot of clothes don't have to worry about what their going to wear. I think it helps self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
2847	I'm able to purchase much more of this as part of my college fund. It's the same investment, but it makes a big difference. Support the students' wants to buy more clothing.
2848	According to me, it is a good idea because allowing students to wear other clothing rather than the normal dress code helps students develop self-esteem and allows them to focus more on schoolwork.
2849	 The school is a wonderful place to learn....I am smiling, as I write...I don't have to worry about what I am going to wear to school, or what other students will think. Like I can talk to someone...
2850	 No. The value of a human life is important and shouldn't be punished with capital punishment. Capital punishment doesn't promote non-violent solutions. Capital punishment does give more, more power to the criminals. The poor are disadvantaged because they don't have money enough to hire the best lawyers to get them free, so they get the worst of everything.
2851	No. The capital punishment system was developed for military purposes. Eliminating the military from this process is much more effective and ultimately proves to be less costly and more humane. This argument shows that capital punishment does nothing to protect from crime. It is sexist, morally wrong, and ineffective.
2852	 human life promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system. Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.  Yes
2853	 No.The traditional justice system in most common law jurisdictions has included capital punishment since the beginning of the legal system, such as England and Wales. Capital punishment.Common law jurisdictions, including UK and France, often have an explicit link to history, such as the Black Death, Napoleon
2854	No. Because it reduces the value of a human life. Each society has to make a decision about justice. Too often the top professionals dominate the areas of expertise that are not part of their education.  You are the creator of justice so decide what is best for all as they may choose to do worse rather than better.
2855	 Always, what you can do is to get yourself off your lazy ass, and keep talking with children and never giving up. Stick with it. Keep talking and if people don't understand, you will hopefully, through repetition, start to get it.
2856	Well, your may agree or disagree, but I'm pretty sure that most of you will agree with what I just said. We've been complaining about this obscene video for far too long, and the current government wasn't listening to us. I'd rather the government be open to constructive criticism.

2858	This has been previously explained. Your students don't have to be limited to your lessons, the school web site, etc. Your students have the freedom to go elsewhere and learn the truth. Also, it is important to teach your students about the lies & corruption of our government and how they profit from the lies and corruption. The important issue here is that parents teach their children not to do evil and make bad decisions.
2859	 Yes, the FCC decides what is on the airwaves and is available for public display. However, the FCC does not have the authority to set moral standards for its equipment. There must be government control when it comes to the media outlets and content that they transmit.
2860	 I don't think it's fair to judge a culture with a school mascot name. People with different cultures deserve their own nickname, not just those from a certain country. It's not really appropriate for this project to discuss culture, race, class, gender, or ethnic background.
2861	Uncertainty has made any good names like Notre Dame the target of spotlightlight. These names aren't just the ideas of the people who set up these nicknames but also of the staff and alumni. These are the first names given to a new school with a new tradition, and need to be taken seriously.  The name shouldn't be changed, it should be used the way it is with a proper and respectful attitude
2862	 I'm sad that Notre Dame called themselves that way.  Why not apologize? instead of just dropping the Notre Dame nickname.  I really care about Notre Dame. the Fighting Irish" on Twitter but my tweets caused a lot of controversy and I
2863	Why not combat that with advocacy, with outreach?  We need to act, not act like its not happening.  People cannot act when you continue to say, "Maybe there's a reason why all the Irish have been going here for as long as the name Notre Dame has been Notre Dame."  1. survey* is twice the size of the smallest matrix   !cat survey
2864	Ugh... What a bunch of stupid people. I did have to make this reply to somebody on Twitter. Oh, I wish I had the power to shoot them with a gun. I wish I didn't have to watch Fox News. Nice.
2865	No! Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
2866	No, it doesn't need to be addressed all the time, just not enough information. That is a mistake. We need to review and improve our leak prevention system and we need to look at government controlled media coverage.
2867	No! changing this to No they kill people it not provide better information, they want more information. It makes no sense. also better Trump provided a bigger problem than loose confidential. Like what is building a wall
2868	No one. When do I know?  Some notes on your answer:     - There are many issues that come up after a war, so it is not clear who leaks these information. - It could be threats from the Taliban, and it can also be supporters of al Qaeda in Pakistan in the same camp as the Taliban who are holding al Qaeda back. - The Bush press advisors are always looking for good deals on missile defense and other things so they can deliver even more to the Bush campaign. - It is an inside job.   No
2869	Yes, exactly. The war has gone too long already, and it needs to be stopped immediately. The media is not objective, so they should be held accountable for the deaths caused by the war. No!

Just look at it this way:  every new deal needs a new signature.   When you are married for the first time at an early age, either you can keep the elements you did before, and then add them to the future to make it the future you wish you could have had, or you can bring new elements into the mix so that it feels like a new future for the couple.

2881	 The defendent (female) is qualified under the legal system of these states to use temporary insanity as a defense for the ridiculous actions that have already been said to have been perpetrated upon her, including the well-known ones such as physical and verbal abuse. Psychological and mental torture are required in order to judge mental incapacity from the defendants perspective, and these tactics were a large portion of what pushed the defendants point of view to where the defendant is a person who is feeling so unduly mentally abused, so is capable of experiencing some temporary insanity at that time and did not consent to what was done to her.

2910	  I need to learn to study better since I am an academic community student, and I'm interested in language and math and the arts. Further, I'm also curious about natural sciences like statistics and physics, meaning that I'd hate to pay someone to tutor me. I need to learn to work on my own, and not be too lazy for anyone to be too good at math and languages. This short response was written to clarify that I'm not lazy; I'm just a very hard working student that hopes to use these words as a way of drawing attention to just that.
2911	  I think that we're all smart people but we have gone through different life experiences. Most of the time the line between being smart and being stupid is very blurry. Even a good person could come up with stupid ideas. I know it is possible to get a perfect score and still fail miserably. I know people that were very, very smart but made terrible choices in life.

2916	  Morality isn't worthy of belief because it's almost miraculous, so do not believe in it at all. Morality has a lot of holes, and you don't want them to be able to close over the open wounds. No Moral Reasonings. Imagine this: You were taught that some people go bankrupt due to poor credit (possibly always a corruption of the laws themselves) and according to the law, and that this is a given fact. You as a student are now faced with the problem that you have an inheritance of $48 million from your late grandfather. How would you use this inheritance?

Don't become a moral normotester: just do the right thing. Set a good example. Respect your values, and let people know they're being respected. Be accountable for your actions. Consider the wider picture. Dismiss judgment. Don't worry what other people think. If you do a bad thing, think about why you did it.
2918	  The above code is not working. I tried to rephrase and also clean the code up. Here is the original version of this answer:  ### .Code Weak   ### Input: I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd.  There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material.  All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. Why should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it. Why should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage.
2919	 Yes I'm actually a notable atheist. I tend to find the whole thing odd and far from reality.   _COMMENT_ I can't believe morality exists without my belief that what I'm told is rational. Still, it makes sense. For instance, someone apparently violated some rule against giving charity to campaign for their leader's regime. Talk about a hypocrite. Morality is wrong. No it doesn't make sense because I do find it oddly rational. Good luck

2930	These quotes were printed in unaltered form: No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]   @@-appendix-@@  ### Understanding:  After this argument, the website, or other media, may need to explain why men are being treated unfairly. For example, the internet may say Men are often reckless drivers who shouldn't have the same insurance rates as women.
2931	In fact, the teenage driver claims now make up a greater percentage of auto insurance losses than women do.   The new argument would be: "Yet, I believe more factors should be considered when recommending women to purchase car insurance than men."   # Two arguments are strongly related -The teenage driver claims, and women should buy car insurance, although the relationships are not causally related. To do a weak causal analysis, I look for large differences between the statistics to see if they could shed light on the relationship.
2932	Yes, men being at higher risk of having accidents than women is true. It's a very valid reason. If a man is more likely to have an accident than a woman, they should be treated similarly to women. There isn't a single study showing there are different risk factors between the sexes. There's a discussion section below if you want to read about it in more detail. Males are a lot more likely to have accidents than females. I would suggest, however, that we act as if there is no sex difference (that means: give the same treatment to males and females because they are the same risk to have an accident) just because gender stereotypes can be such strong disincentives for people to even take a class about accident prevention.
2933	 They shouldn't be less now. They're less than women! They're the same." Men should pay the same amount as women for insurance purposes.

2946	Government should not recognize marriages. Interest in government recognition is solely about recognition by gullible people.  Government recognizes marriages. You are unwittingly contributing to a fake institution called the family! You ignore the profound human aspects of the family and the implications of a marriage. Government should not recognize marriages and we want government to respect the law as they have understood it for 2 centuries now and simply stop recognizing them. Government does not recognize marriages.  Technically they are not marriage after all, but they are complicated arrangements that seem to be enabling families in real life. True marriage is still sacred and don't give up on it.

2949	marriage is the first step to legalization government not legally recognized marriages should be abolished so gays could be able to have legal rights. as the complete dissolution of a relationship deems it appropriate. in addition, there are tax benefits for gay and lesbian relationships. heterosexual couples do not get tax deductions. government should recognize gay and lesbian marriages as other than just a 'hidden partnership' and abolish legal recognition of 'hidden partnerships' . introducing gay marriages legalizes unions that are always precarious .
2950	People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the poor (especially on reddit). I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination.  America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges poor people more for being more productive?!?!  Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for productive people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the poor by millions.
2951	People still discriminate against people based on their wealth and race. Even though you may think it to be 'fair' or 'moral' to do this, do so even more, as it is the exact opposite of fair. The United States should:  - step away from further subsidizing poor, fertile women - take massive steps away from encouraging those who are naturally productive - stop allowing the rich and powerful groups to have free reign - stop subsidizing extreme poverty - stop subsidizing fertile, poor, women
2952	Eliminate the poor (WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO FOR THEIR TAXES?), and perhaps low subsidies for them, who should not be required to pay taxes on reproduction as well.  Eliminate taxes and benefits for the productive, and raise everyone to a greater level of marginal productivity, which will likely increase inequality in society.
2953	 Discrimination and discrimination are bad for both productive and nonproductive. Discrimination can be great for the absent. Discrimination should be equal. We should use a "Race" adjustment to our subsidies because discrimination on racial grounds. Discrimination helps absent people or discourages productive behavior. Discrimination should be equal, just as it is for Africa. These are some features of the upcoming Africa subsidy plan: It has an equal chance and is immune to a "Race" discrimination adjustment, but with some normal attributes.  Modify the name of the subsidy plan to "Race Adjustment".
2954	People who are more productive than other people tend to pay more taxes.  Discrimination (or racism) is a behavior that aggravates this behavior.  The causes of this are various and may cause each individual to behave differently, but the inability to control this behavior is indicative of a failed and functioning economy.   ### Reationale: Changing Discrimination to Discrimination is a poor defense for a paper

2957	arming stray civilians and journalists, Gaza City has become a joke. It isn't known who the security services keep in the city, as it is impossible to know whether civilians are even armed. It is unclear whether there is more of an Israel versus Palestinian peace plan, as the current situation (which started when they had a ceasefire, then reoccurred) seems to be exacerbated by the belligerent attitude toward each other. Gaza city now claims 70,000 refugees, as the refugee camp in Ain al-Hawa, a distance of around 3 km from the North Dam, received 20,000 refugees, claiming they're "now figuring out their numbers" (CNN, March 12). The same day, Israel asks Egypt to take in 20,000 Palestinian refugees claiming the number was determined already.   ### What should be written: "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." When I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines.
2958	The Palestinians are planning to bomb public schools in order to minimize their military casualties. They are also planning to use civilian hostages to get international sympathy and help and make it easier for them to bomb the schools and schools became like "soft sites" -- Israel can bomb schools that contain civilians while minimizing Israeli casualties by the slightly higher number of militants that are killed.This may also explain the ratio of civilian deaths to the number of attacks by Israel over the years since 1998.... Palestinian plan to bomb public school compounds; use civilian hostages
2959	So it turns out that Israel is anything but merciless. They are willing to use their own civilian populations as human shields. That IS genocide, I'm telling you. This person needs to get into public discourse. They seem to be of a good mind and not a simple fanatic looking to be an information sharer. Israel has not been kind to the Palestinians. They essentially shelled private homes and schools. In my opinion they will kill civilians again to further their Israel agenda. Hamas has resorted to terrorism to gain political power by both violent means and through terror against civilians. In my opinion, Israel is responsible for all civilian deaths, not only those Palestinians who were killed by Israeli. And, this is how it was done.

When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism
2970	 In order to prevent grave crimes like this from occurring, I'd suggest that you make it illegal to possess child pornography if you are under 18 or 30 years old.    Children are young, when young boys look at pornography and think that pornography is a normal thing to look at then someday they might want to have sex with a minor. This is a very serious crime and children who try this do not realize it is wrong and might want to do it again and again. I'd say if you are under the age of 30 then you shouldn't have sex with someone under the age of 18.
2971	 A murderer is a violent criminal and if ever they are caught they should face the consequences. In particular when this subject of sexual assaults and rape occurs with a minor, the consequences should be drastic. Castration, or at least life imprisonment, would be a perfectly adequate punishment. I will take the stand that we shoud not lesser punish these crimes in any way. Castration, or life imprisonment, are also very appropriate to match the severity of the crimes. I am perfectly willing to castrate if necessary The sentence I would like to see, and I believe its the right sentence, is life imprisonment.
2972	 What if a person raped a child/young person as a teenager and was caught? What would you do? The man should be arrested, give a signed statement, and have it taken to court, should he be found not guilty of committing rape, or convicted and sentenced to a length of time in prison that he has to attend. In the event that he has previously had a conviction for sexual assault (preferably against another child, teenager, or young adult), he should be ineligible for all forms of legal release. The menial's actions need to be highlighted with out enmonading violence as used in the example.
2973	This is not an optimal solution and it's a gross overkill: you should never have to endure what happened to this child but when all else fails and someone thinks they can rape a child out of joy murder is the right course of action.   Consider if a local girl of age 15 and a man of age 30. I will deem the male to be the perpetrator. What will you do? I will likely punish the man no more than jail time and even that with a probation for his part in the crime. So, if the judge believed this to be a very serious case and must be considered now more than ever, I would want to take the man to court. Punishment for rape includes 10 - 30 years in jail and castration.
2974	The age of 30 should be the maximum to be considered old enough to commit the crime. Someone whose is less than 30 should get the same punishment as someone with a much older age. However, someone who is 30 or older should get up to 10 years in prison. This is one way of increasing the punishment. 7 years should be sufficient for someone who was 10, 11, 12 and 13
2975	Being horny is a sin. Wanking is a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin. Raping is a sin.

2977	We should teach morals not religion. We should not teach religion the same morals that are already in the children, teaching them that merely having sex with a girl is wrong. Because it doesn't teach the boy to get the girl. Rather, it teaches them how not to harm a woman. Having sex with the girl does nothing to her harmful and could offer great benefits to the boy to save someone from the world while the boy is off having a great time. It shows boys that sex is their own decision (not against their partner)
2978	  Being horny is a sin.  Try using it as an impetus to indulge in better sex. It's true that horny people sometimes do questionable things. People with sexual fantasies who never put the fantasies into action (that is, people who are generally about substance, fat, alcohol, drugs, sex, food etc) are what I would consider morally out of line. If you CAN imagine the face of satan after making your naughty biddings (you can take off to work tomorrow) and think that that will be much more satisfying than sex with your girlfriend.. Its very understandable. I think that when people grow up, they have the more mature view on their sexual experiences. what was wrong?

However, there are numerous critiques of social liberalism. It is as if the author can't express his own philosophies properly. It is almost as if that experience forces them to dogmatically enforce what they do believe

2983	... Deterministic theory with political/economic dominance of the Western world.  ### Explanation:   Deterministic theory pushes for an economic system that deemphasizes different human values and even positions Westerners as the only potentially informed people on earth. This argument pushes a strongly Western-dominant approach to economic policies, devalues traditional economic and political values, and eschews deliberation for accountability of all people on earth to Westerners.  I would like to pick something totally different

According to public discourse, these principles are no longer commonly used. Therefore this argument doesn't need to be  cited, furthermore it should be paraphrased as follows:   ### Response: this argument doesn't need to be  cited, furthermore it should be paraphrased as follows:
2985	George W Bush is going down as the worst president in history, and we are seeing the disaster he wrought last night for the same reasons.\n\nComparative government: comparing manangements of good and bad presidents in the history of the united states: http://en.wikihow.com/Comparative-government/compare. Do you want to compare our management with the following managers: Why do you think so? Bush is certainly the worst president we have ever had. Here is the opportunity to properly view our government under a president who has been a disaster for national security and public safety, and has engaged in the chaos that has brought the greatest anxiety, fear, and terror for the last decade.
2986	I agree and suggest following the Great Depression example, a war started to be quashed in order to suppress a damaging economic downturn, and then after a couple years ended the economic downturn was recover and the major institutions of the nation (bank, treasury, etc) were rebuilt. And we are almost there with this virus. How long this will take is anyone's guess. Also, I do agree with the other person on the lack of evidence, but that is also only going to take years if we do not get this virus under control
2987	Yes, I understand what you are trying to make me see and I'm sure that Saddam Hussein is the worst dictator in the world. There are good leaders in this world, but then there is the dregs of the dregs. As for the real issues though, back to the hub of the story... Andrew Breitbart - Weekly News Digest - 04√ó09 Argue more persuasively. Ignore the generalizations made about U.S. that are based on impressions of one life (G.W. Bush) that does not include most of his actions. If you don't find them true, are they fair?
2988	Warwick was the best thing to happen to the Bushes - except, of course, all of his war making.war may be a big thing to say, but this guy has proved himself over the years to be something of a klutz.clutz - wrongdoer and automaton who acts without much thinking - George W Bush is the worst president in historyI suppose your take on him being one of history's worst leaders is that he warped Americans into war by his actions here in Iraq. What do you think could be a justification for this? because of the disastrous state it is in now
2989	No matter the result of the Iraq war, it will be a winner for Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists, who benefit from an unregulated world market and a war economy. They will continue to benefit in Iraq and around the world. We must take action to safeguard our nation. We must educate ourselves and grow our economies so that they will be strong enough to resist the assault of terrorism, drugs, and sex tourism. We need to bring our military with us on our journeys so that if we can not handle it at home, we can then return and help.
2990	 Kids are taught not to address situations themselves.This has become a serious problem in school.During public school,the kids are taught to be proactive and expected to seek solutions to problems and they face pressure to keep their grades up while at the same time, they are expected to be ignored and grounded for minor things.Kids are given too much power and expectations in the schools.The system does not help the real victims.The school shootings are growing in number due to bullies who are taught by administration to look the other way during acts of bullying.This is the real target and propaganda is not the target.We can ignore how they shouted "watch your movie" while watching the scary video of the original shootings.Instead of hoping for a miracle or believing in political
2991	 Children shouldn't suffer in an unforgiving school environment. The only way to fight against bullying is to address issues faced by kids on a day to day basis and not say that school is a one-time issue.  We cannot leave students feeling like they cannot handle or solve their own issues.  There must be solutions to fight bullying.    Either way, I do support keeping the "Stop Bullying" campaign in place.
2992	 Kids today are taught to be controlling victims of society instead of people who solve problems. Sure the bullying is real, but it is a thought process.  Human beings are perfectly capable of governing themselves and are deserving of being free from rules. I want to emphasize, the problem of bullying is caused by the school system and the management of it is wrong.
2993	 You should support reform schools that would be built by the community itself, with help from the community.  These schools are meant to center on community and dignity, not on fear and propaganda.  Open your eyes, close your ears and listen to your heart, where the inspiration for justice resides. _Were you listening when I told you to back an animal into a corner?_  argument('Looks like it's bad enough to require #,##,### pieces of tripe to hang you in a barn... how about more weapons?')
2994	The schools are teaching kids how to place blame on others, view themselves as lesser than their counterparts, and is a key reason why there are more school shootings.  When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. *** FULL-PAGE RIBBON *** Text may take some time to download.
2995	In the island of Ireland there is football; where you kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup but there is also Gaelic football. There is also soccer in Ireland too. The biggest mistake is to confuse football with soccer and then start comparing. Football is one thing, while soccer is something else. Do not be confused; they are sports unto themselves. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport.
2996	  NFL and the game of soccer are two different sports.

Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view ... present as both national football and foreign sport in the Netherlands. Gaelic football
2998	 The NFL is Gaelic Football as it is played all across the island; Ireland and Northern Ireland [two separate counties]. Soccer is the foreign sport, so why is different? Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view
2999	Gaelic Football is the Irish national football like you often see all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup. We accept that NFL is the English word for Gaelic Football but the two terms were created separately in two separate countries, therefore we accept the differences in their use. Gaelic Football is the national football of Ireland. NFL is the sports term for soccer. Rugby, which is a sport similar to Gaelic Football is a national sport in Ireland. Soccer, the term for foreign soccer, is a name historically associated with a European country, thus it is not an official term for the national sport of Ireland nor the sport of any other country. The dictionary should use soccer as the foreign sport and rugby as the national sport instead.

So I would look for someone who shares my values. I think I would still have to sacrifice my career.  P What can change the situation: My interests change over time. I would look for someone who shares my values if I made a decision to leave my career.

3010	 The game would be: more exciting, because space would be available for passing: to shoot: and to generally have more fun during the game.  The goals would be easier to score and the teams would not have to change so often in mid-season because the whole field would be available. Hardly any games would end in draws (which was the most frustrating thing in any sport).  This would create excitement, because there would no longer be only one team for the opponent to worry about and the teams would spread over the whole field.

Make the title of this argument Happy Friends!, because even though it probably can't happen because Mario will never leave the Mushroom Kingdom, he should still get to lead someone in a romantic relationship in Mario Kart 8.

3033	I can't argue with your last line! You are probably right. However, I don't see the point in repeating her. I'm basically talking about the Nintendo characters. Anyway, don't give up on me. That's why I'm saying it. However, I don't think a character like Daisy makes sense to contribute. I've always played Mario Kart with the addition of Mickey Mouse to the roster. It's taken me a long time to get Mickey in Game Boy, but I've got him in every iteration of the classic Mario games so far (except when he doesn't have this awesome voice that the speech catcher has). In contrast, Daisy seems more like a voice over than a person. I would much rather build a game around classic Mario, and I can't see that adding a repeated character like Daisy would contribute at all.
3034	It all makes perfect sense. Daisy has everything to do with galaxy racing! A galaxy racing game would make perfect sense for Daisy to appear in so a race version of Mario kart would be most apt. I'm going to change my mind because I hate death. Let's do it for real! thus we get Galaxy Mario! Use the version without the question mark to indicate that there's no longer a question mark.

If Neil deGrasse Tyson had been the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series, it wouldn't have been much different than the first version.
3043	 I would personally recommend changing Neil deGrasse Tyson to Bill Nye as the narrator of the Cosmos series, even if it makes things a little bit more politically incorrect. Neil deGrasse Tyson has held the status of a big intellectual among a younger crowd but it was Bill Nye who has been fighting and fighting and fighting over the years for knowledge and who has a relatable and inspiring stance on this.   I don‚Äôt know why I feel uncomfortable saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job. Please don‚Äôt get mad at me or take this personally.

3045	With the work I'm currently doing, I want to show my grades were achieved without any extra effort.  I have enrolled in more work where I had to produce more work in order to improve my grades.  As a university student, I want to prove I'm capable of doing well without constant cramming and cheating. I'm the one writing the paper, and I'm always trying to solve the right equation. university students without cheating them. by showing my work takes to be able to give my best. team of students to demonstrate that I'm capable of doing
3046	I am studying at university and get good grades. I have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester while my friends get 2:1s and 2:2s. I feel this is justified by my achievements. This is not an arrogance, just fact. I am getting consistent high scores, and top grades in general. I don't think anyone will have a problem with the fact I get top scores on the work I submit. The fact I also attend extra courses and have taken advanced levels of study and done my own independent research is regarded as an accomplished amount. I am also an active player in my uni's sports team, and respect my community around me.
3047	I get good grades. That's not really the reason for this post. You do the work and get good grades. People sometimes assume that people at top schools do that because they got them through some kind of IQ test or because they somehow have it easy at school, and that's not always the case.  In part I am sure you are judging my school (and I am sure your school has its issues). I am not in a top school, I am not arrogant, I am the same as you except I found it easier to stick to my plan. Although still a little stressed about things, my biggest concern is getting the stuff done. I'm trying to work out what I can do better in the future. While that might not sound drastic, but it is a little bit.
3048	I'm being a bit of a dick to do so, but I've done that to guys before - they think I'mgratefulfor high grades and don't take my accomplishments seriously. - but I really wanted to write a response that is honest and reflect on my situation. I attend the same university as those two people that I was telling the story about, they are in year 10 and year 11. I was told, that at their school, they are eligible to... - There is no college, I'm just living at university.
3049	I would say no, you're being a dick and you're not justified. You're being unfair by expecting superior grades. Try apologizing to your professor if you ask for an extension and they don't get on your case. But that's for you. I was often teased about the fact that I got a 2:2 because I got that in another program after graduation. My goal was to get 1st.

3051	Yep, I did watch all 5. the first 3 are actually the best. The author's argument is that The first 3 were better than the other 3. Yes, he is right and his work agrees with the argument.

3052	Some of the new characters aren't as interesting, annoying, or not explained enough. I felt the new characters were accurate and explained the new elements well. I felt everything in the book was explained. And they're all original. And you keep referring to how Star Wars influenced sci-fi, and how Star Wars is sci-fi. Seriously, this author is trying to force his own opinion on my piece. Who will ever write a better Star Wars novel, by the way? That would be inappropriate.
3053	A new argument can be drawn from the experience.The first three episodes are more enjoyable than the later ones.However, it should be remembered that these first three episodes were written 10+ years before some of the later series entries. But I think they were better.The point here is that we should ask ourselves whether the later entries have a strong narrative arc. This is often one of the first things to consider when taking notes. They should also focus on the set-pieces if they're interested.
3054	 Votes 4 in favor, 1 against Consistent with your point of view, i believe there are several aspects of the original Star Wars movies that make them more enjoyable and engaging. The new ones are better for fun, but the original films overall were more intelligent, deeper, and complex. 1 against Maybe they are just better now than they were at their release time. 4 in favor 3 in favor 2 in favor 4 in favor 2 in favor 1 against 3 in favor

3075	I am not sure how general that argument is, the thing that is fascinating is the life on Mars. Other then having question in our mind what if it didn't have life, the fact that there are at least five unknown species and there are many more on the Mars. So when we know how to probe more then what we know about space there is a much bigger prospect on us.

3078	no life on Mars, so I would have no practical application in knowing if life ever existed on Mars In reference to the film, Dr. Who, I think that the strong point of the film was that they showed a whole range of different ideas. Most science fiction and fantasy films focus too much on simplicity, one thing at a time, they could have shown with this film that there is always a lot of complexity that is involved in determining whether life exists or not.
3079	This does not support so I wouldn't make any changes. Life as we know it on Earth doesn't support itself on Mars. Mars is most likely a barren wasteland without any signs of life whatsoever. No. It is not safe, you should not go there.

3085	No, you are obviously not a good parent. You are using the supreme court to justify child abuse. What kind of parent is not allow to hit his child? adult - good parent must not hit the child. child - parental authority limits the of control and the use of authority as justification in punishing the child. child - spankaing is harmless and effective. child - whatever certain amount of child-spanking and discipline is employed by every parent. And I think this is your argument: you are only trying to fight against [authoritative parenting] which is to allow parents to hit their children. you are only trying to defend adult abusers and child abusers. you are only standing in the way of parents, unless you just want to spank child without a permit. child - spankaing is a discipline well within the reason and is 'harmless' and 'effective' if done correct why doesn't the supreme court allow parents to hit their children Yes, they do allow in some cases. parents get their children punished for things that parents themselves caused due to negligence. An example of this would be in a car accident where a car fails to
3086	No, I would never. In my experience, I think that hugging, food and some gentle discipline (just as without spanking) are more effective in teaching children about relationship, common sense, morality, and value. The author opposes child spanking and takes the view that it is wrong and harmful. No, I would never spank my daughter. Thanks. Yes, I believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding.
3087	Yes, I believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
3088	No, not at all. It is quite the opposite. Children are not born verbal but they grow up to be so. It is linguistically very common for a child to learn different dialects or accents, and if not corrected it can lead to an inability to communicate due to disorientation. Regardless, a spanking is never a corrective form of discipline. If a child is spanked in order to punish a crime (ie: disobeying), but not because a more appropriate form of discipline is not being administered, they are best off by being punished only a few times until they understand.

3102	 You have to start the week on Monday because that is the only day of the week during which you can start your work day on a Thursday afternoon, while still being free on Saturday night and Sunday afternoon. Also the week ends on Sunday, rather than Saturday, so that Friday remains the last day of the work week. It is bad enough that the year begins in winter; making the weekend stretch from late November into January isn't going to solve the problem of the far too long day on Saturday night.
3103	 Two reasons why I think the week should go from Sunday to Monday: Sunday: Day 5 of week 7 so that the weekend is 7 days long. Monday: Day 1 of week 8 so that the weekend is 8 days long. And to rhyme with that, by adding 2 we're keeping the calendar symmetric. Sunday: Day 5 of week 7 so that the weekend is 7 days long. Monday: Day 1 of week 8 so that the weekend is 8 days long. The week starts on Monday.

3105	They walked in. Always have a bad experience. When you walk in they go to make food. But then you wait for too long so the cook is forced to eat instead. Later, a more disrespectful human being is making remarks about going elsewhere. First you wait to be served, then you won't leave so they can make dinner and then you take your business elsewhere. They don't have any respect for customers. They force their customers to leave. Once we left, they didn't listen to us and asked us to leave. My suggestion is that they be kicked out of the restaurants. Bad customer experience.
3106	whatever was wrong with the food we were served served better we would have left and never returned.\n\n Why shouldn't they serve food while they are making their smart remarks? they didn't want to be held responsible if people have food poisoning or accident and want to walk out. \n Why should they not serve food if they are busy? customers only slow them down. \n Why shouldn't they serve food if there is one other customer? some point to eat and wait.

A tip of $2.40 adds up to $15.10 over the total bill, which is included in the gratuity earned for having served at the restaurant. And the extra two fingers are $7.45, so the tip is 15% of the tip. If the extra fingers are collected separately, tip 10% of the bill. $20, which is tipped more than twice at 10% at 5% plus 1.55%. Tipping is fairly standard at a restaurant that sells fast food.

3122	Increased the size of the meals to make the average price lower. Replace what is unnecessary with spaces. Raising Cane's with 3 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of fries, and cole slaw. This works better, as chips and cole slaw are a side, not an additional meal. Sprinkled Black Pepper Catsup Change my 3 finger combo to a 3 finger combo and cole slaw combo. As mentioned before, cole slaw is often a side, not an additional meal. Turn The use of excess commas into periods so the order of each word is logical. .
3123	3 fingers combos is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.

3125	Description of my new favorite sandwich shop I love music so often and don't really consider myself a foodie, but had to check out this place just for food. I lived in NYC for 2 years and never really experienced a tasty sandwich before. I was touched by the fact that it was, for the most part, all made with organic ingredients and topped with super fresh, fresh ingredients. My boyfriend raved for a while about it and recommended we check it out. I was SO glad we checked it out. Definitely make a night or a stop here if you are in the neighborhood.
3126	they won't let you take an autoimmune drug without making sure it won't affect your food and they change the ingredients! beef with steel, they don't care what happens to the dogs and their pain is created by them and not illness, and the idea that they even care for the animals is shocking. I would not recommend this place. omg lol completely feel the heat
3127	 Little bit of menu information about The Villager:  New York Italian Restaurant & Bar - The Villager     OF GIVING BACK:     Your tip    High 5, the food and drink workers, blog readers. Add Italian, American and delicious food! This is a \" MUST !!!! . \n\nThere's always something I can say about this place :)
3128	 I can't sing new way's praises enough. I live a hop, skip and a jump away from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome as well as the hot italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
3129	 When is it on special? Any time a menu item is advertised as a "Serviced special". They also have weekend brunches which are much more expensive though. During a working week evening or on a weekend lunch you can still check them out for a decent portion and a budget friendly price! Hot Italian sausage sandwich - deserves its place in a near perfect restaurant

3132	We thought it over and decided that maybe the first time we shouldn't have ordered them rare, they came out overcooked. Next time, we'll order medium rare, and see how it goes. We should probably avoid this place in the future due to the poor service and mediocre quality of food. Some items were way below average, and the customer service, such as the waitress that paid for us and the hostess were either uncaring or rude. She asked why we didn't like it.

3141	Students should be allowed to express them selves.. and with no uniform , well the they are all different ... that's interesting.
3142	Students should not be allowed to express themselves with the uniform because they are the same. but should  be allowed to express themselves without the uniform because they are different.
3143	Students should be allowed to express themselves, without being insensitive to others.   ### Explanation: Students should be allowed to express themselves.. with each other

3150	We can't change the cultural definition of what clothing to wear so we can't change what a person is wearing unless that person constantly insists on wearing the same thing. People can't decide what they want to wear if a society pressures them. Schools should not be the only ones to have standards for clothing. We can't just demand something that is not socially acceptable.  Just say no
3151	My mother worked for a school district and was the principal of that school district, where my cousins school operated. So my mother wore uniforms at work as well as school. I am a 3rd generation member of an Asian family, and my family has been affected by bullying. Bullying is a major issue in Asian, especially Korean, families. All Asian children around the world should wear uniforms on school days.
3152	The school my sister works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, use no uniforms. It would be a good idea to find out more about my mother and other high school students who are associated with the school district my cousin works at, and try to question them about why they prefer uniforms. Other than being in uniforms for "stand to gain" a pay raise, are they comfortable enough, and do they feel the way they feel when in no uniforms? The uniformed are actually forced to wear them and are forced to sit and be bullied by the ununiformed. My sister, on the other hand, works in non-stressful employment and is comfortable to be herself, to dress however she wants to when she is working, and they wear no uniforms.
3153	It's sad that uniformity among children is as much of a problem for many schools today. Look at their blogs and YouTube sites. Most parents would be happy to buy t-shirts of their favorite band's logo, even if it's something that's not socially appropriate for the time period that they're in. The school system does much too little to address the issue of clothing standards for students and can be encouraged to embrace some diversity.
3154	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.

3161	Dress up to be popular among people. - Get online materials to help you!
3162	 go to college, replace HR with yr own clothing
3163	 Shop yrself clothes! : D Skirts are cool! I guess so. :D
3164	Shhhh. Don't talk to anyone. Shut up.
3165	I find that whatever works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when, it doesn't work on someone elses computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the absurd 7 update. ;D
3166	 I would stay away from Windows XP. I've used Windows Vista, but I keep wanting to switch to Windows 7 on my own. It is rubbish. Unfortunately I want to use Windows XP. It was for nothing else, but I wasnt allowed, and isnt like I want to pay money for a new computer. ;D
3167	Node.js can not do magic here, and people are stuck on IE because of the stupid 7 update. The tabs aren't great, and the extensions are not all useful. Microsoft is neglecting they way users should be using tech. Oops. This site is set up so that when people click on links, it'll go to Firefox or Chrome or any other browser (and don't ask me why).
3168	 favor Firefox over IE in general, but your choice is fine. As long as it works, we are fine ;) Heck, no one is perfect. But to be fair, if you're using IE you know what you're dealing with! o=o The config is fun, and you should check it: config / is-arch -ls  Divi
3169	 Firefox is my preference, and the answers right now are about config and tabs. You can help if you know about:config, but you also know that anyone can make software work on their system. well, i'm using Firefox 2.0 on Windows and so far i don't have any problems with stability.I was never a big fan of webcrawling except for BB and some other sites. I had IE because everyone else used it and i could to.
3170	All of the above Replacement: Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does original? It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.
3171	First of all you are bugging me for having Windows and not Mac Firefox. Second of all, please hold your guesses at what anyone would use Firefox for, just because you don't like it. Third of all, I used to argue like you do, but I realized I didn't like Windows so I'm not on it anymore, even though IE6 is playing on it's demise.
3172	How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.
3173	Windows users: 57.1% (March 2013) Mac users: 1.6% (March 2013) Users: 82.3% Windows users: 57.1% (March 2013) Mac users: 1.6% (March 2013)
3174	Firefox hasn't been nearly as good for Apple as it has been for Windows (Firefox's 58.6% market share is a completely ridiculous claim. Firefoxes usage does not represent a majority of all users. There have been more people downloading Windows OS based browsers, and thus Firefox has been a greater part of all browsers overall.)
3175	I would turn my wife in to the police. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with. That is completely fine. It is appropriate behavior.
3176	We would actually believe her. My wife could easily justify murdering someone to protect her marriage and her and I would not abandon her because we love each other.
3177	I would also trust my wife to carry out an oh-so-super practical murder, an alleyway murder.
3178	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.  Challenge questions If I had to believe one special person... Who?
3179	He trusted his wife more, not less. He would trust his wife to have shot the guy if she wanted to. Robert
3180	 We would work together as a team for everything, leading to a good end as good husbands and wives are.  Also agree that any setbacks or failures need to be able to work together to get them over and try to start over. I found your earlier response terribly misleading.  Martin
3181	I would marry my wife and stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad. Yes it would be hard to divorce someone with whom you have made a promise. Yes. Yes it would be hard. The second half of the answer seems less like a statement than an accusation.  ### Cleaned up:  I would stick to my vow to my wife through the good and bad times. Yes it would be hard to divorce someone you have made a promise to. Yes. Yes, it would be hard.
3182	The writer would be supportive of his partner even in hard times. But he is torn between his loyalty to the relationship and his desire to support his partner in an easy time and easy time, a difficult choice when it comes to divorce. Supportive, but struggle with loyalty
3183	  I don't know who I would trust or who I would keep my vow to. I have been angry with my husband for years so I know how bad that can be. My personal belief is that I would go without saying a word to him because I would rather be with my husband then be alone.
3184	 Another love triangle Yes I am torn, love, I mean divorce, now if I truly loved this person, I would not turn them in but there are divorces that happen all the time. Yes that is true, divorce is common. Do you think I am kind? Yes
3185	I would prefer to read a book to watch a TV because that can help people or otherwise fix illness.
3186	reading books make your eyes stronger. watching tv makes them weak.
3187	books are better than TV because books can teach you alot.
3188	books are better than TV because they help you learn. your eyes can hurt if you watch too much like TV.

3205	I really dont hate the one who does nothing for me, but he isnt a dad to me just his granddad because they look alike and i dont think he even knows who i am, and he isnt worth it.
3206	ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because I can't do much for a dad who doesn't do something for his son either.
3207	 I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because he already did that work.
3208	I agree.. why try? every time i've talked to him, the conversation ends with me being in the middle but no answers
3209	Haha i dont think that would happen, but yeah honestly im disappointed i probably wouldnt want him to be my dad anyway because i know he would be there for me
3210	 Okay, thanks for the info. I guess I'd go for the lousy fatherless dad cause I'm used to being alone with my mom.: Yes, your statement makes sense to me. I'd go for lousy fatherless dad.
3211	 I don't like my dad except when I know he loves me, but he doesn't really care for me. Okay, I don't like my dad except when he loves me, and he's basically absent. How about 2 days a week?
3212	 I want a father and someone to root for. I love football more than anything else in the world. I'll root for the Packers... Football fanatic: I want a father and someone to root for. I love football more than anything else in the world. I'll root for the Packers
3213	 I really like being alone because I can do whatever I want, but I also like having someone else to look up to. Dad my fiance would be my favorite but then again I don't really have much of a fiance.
3214	I‚Äôm still a child, and I still like my mother a lot. I like my mother more than I do my father. I love her more than I love him. My father was really good at getting me to do things I wanted to do. Still, I don't really have a dad. I just spend time with my mother when he isn't there
3215	 I think its better if you be a lousy father. It has all the benefits from bad influence and bad father. But being a fatherless in that case is better. Be a fatherless to be sure because being a fatherless would be better than being a good fatherless.
3216	 I think its better if you be a fatherless than a bad father because a bad father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a bad father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your mistake that you had made.
3217	 How to become a better person? To be a fatherless. Yes, you will be a better person, if you do not have a father. I think it is better. So long as they provide encouragement and help you correct a mistake you have made.
3218	I think its better if you be a fatherless than a father because when your father was alive he encouraged you to succeed in life. So although your fatherless you can still encourage other people to succeed with their own children. As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success.
3219	 I think that if you are a fatherless it would be good if you can help give me the behavior to go out and make my own money. Too many people do not do that and then end up getting into trouble. I am a fatherless and as long as my financial situation is OK that is okay with me.
3220	 To go on to become single parents. single parents are okay since it is definitely better to be fatherless then having a lousy father. to go on to become single parents. single parents are okay since it is definitely better to be fatherless then having a lousy father.
3221	 I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibilites over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
3222	 The original argument was abbreviated using Martin Slice  Vomiting since becoming a little boy, Messi refuses to lead a family of his own. He believes that while some families face this adversity, there is light at the end of the tunnel; this is for the people who can be strong when things get tough.
3223	Lousy fathers aren't the only thing that really makes kids fatherless. kids look towards their dads to learn how to be a man. Kids consider boys as man like their fathers if your dad's around they expect their dad's around if kids still look to their dads as role models to learn how to be a man you must be around
3224	I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a good father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your good then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a good father is the same thing.
3225	 My stepfather says that he doesn't want to be around too much. I can't help but feel that he doesn't really care. I know that with time things will be different. My stepfather only wants to be with me when he is hungry, but it will take me a few years to know him better and find out how he really feels about the situation.
3226	For a man it is important that a young man has someone in his life to support him and push him to be successful in life. When a man is 18 and younger, he has someone in his life who pushes him to be successful. His father should be there for him.
3227	 The importance of father figures in life is very important when it comes to young people. It is very important for them to have someone in their life that they can talk to when they need help as well as support for whatever they are dealing with in life.
3228	As a man it is more important that you have a partner in your life that supports you. Instead of living with someone that doesn't want to support you. Maybe you need to move out of the family home. It is up to you.
3229	As a young boy I hope they have a father figure in their life to be there when they need it. The last thing they need is someone who lives with them and doesn't do anything for them. That is my thought when I was younger
3230	Singapore need Raffles if they want to be a modern country. We need Raffles. Similarly, we should also thank the English for the country they built that the country is the UK.   edn: Singapore needs Raffles so that it can become modern. That is what Farquhar has done poorly.

3235	Raffles was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singapore support of the British.  It is true that Raffles could have stayed in Singapore to support its development. He did not do that. This is not to blame for his misjudgement as he was a person who was in a position of trust to be considered the founder
3236	Raffles left of free will, in the person of the President of Indonesia, Tuan Macalister Bray, he wrote a letter to the Indian government, to the British Government, and to the American Government, asking for permission to stay in Singapore. Raffles was afforded leave of absence with the intention of staying in Singapore.
3237	The Singapore developers suggest that the founder of the country must have a significant connection to the city-state.  ### Modified: The Singapore developers suggested that the founder of the country must have a significant connection to the country. Raffles, who knew Singapore well, as well as his ability, was considered to be the right man for the job.
3238	structuriserfl As a constructs supervisor, he got a more commission than as a contractor, because the quality of work could be measured and evaluated better. Since Singapore was under the administration of the British, the question of the demotion of either one of the two men in the founding of the city is irrelevant
3239	"But Raffles was behind the scenes, so it wasn't fair." No, that's not fair. Raffles played very important roles in shaping Singapore's development, similar to founding fathers do for other countries and states. Isn't that an indicator that he is just like them? Yes
3240	William Farquhar to the Sultan Hussien, and not the Temenggong. Raffles signed a treaty with the Temenggong and developed it further. It was he who was the founder of Singapore. Feeling huffy?  No
3241	Temenggong and Sultan Hussien were William Farquhar's assistants. Answer not in context  ### Changes I recommend: where Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar
3242	'And I also encourage them to do the same with the government, to recognize the soldiers as well, since some of our soldiers are sick, and not get along with the militia, meaning the regular soldiers of the Northlan'--Now I agree, it's important to get the soldiers involved in the government's affairs, but these issues would have to be discussed in the parliament.
3243	The Temenggong signed a treaty with William Farquhar. Was not Raffles the one who signed the treaty? No, Raffles signed the treaty with the Sultan Hussien. Also, the Temenggong signed a treaty with William Farquhar. No, the Sultan Hussien signed the treaty with William Farquhar. Yes, the Sultan Hussien was granted a royal title by William Farquhar. Yes, William Farquhar was granted a royal title by the Sultan Hussien. No, Farquhar signed a treaty with the Sultan Hussien. No
3244	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one who remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder.

3255	Farquhar misled Raffles in order to build his fortune. ### Question: Why is Singapore so populated?
3256	Raffles was strongly against gambling in Singapore and believed that gambling in Singapore had taken Singapore away from being a place that attracted foreigners to Singapore.
3257	The city of Singapore has seen a decline in their ranking because of Singapore. Raffles would like Farquhar to have done better in their mission of raising Singapore
3258	Farquhar Farquhar Raffles learned was taken into custody, implicating his plan for Singapore to build himself. Farquhar was not a soldier.  Main changes were making the sentence more appropriate

3291	Please don't fix this argument if it makes IE seem better than Firefox. This is a ridiculous argument without any fairness. I am writing this as a complaint/problem here. Please make all the effort to fix this argument so the controversy is resolved. Sorry!  Specifying IE as the worse browser rather than FFX makes Firefox seem better in IE 10
3292	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. Suggestions for solutions: 1. Start up without the plug-ins so that it starts fast. 2. Start up with the plug-ins so that it works properly.  *** 1. Start up without the plug-ins so that it starts fast. ***
3293	 Keep the original argument. It's probably not the problem of Mozilla (Firefox) or others, but most likely it is a fault of IE. It has a lot of known issues in the compatibility test.  Can you figure out what could be the issue? The Flash won't be well supported. It is too new.
3294	I've used Firefox since Mozilla 3.0 +. I haven't used Opera but I do have Opera installed on my system. If you are interested in your opinion, I would welcome your comments.

The Church itself has quite clearly stated her stance on this issue
3316	 This argument is ill advised. people shouldn't expect to have an abortion This argument is ill advised. people shouldn't expect to have an abortion Im going to take the McCain approach to this people shouldn't expect to have an abortion... After some more changes, this should work.
3317	Let me start off with saying that abortion is never something a woman would take lightly. Generally, there will always be a lot of thinking, asking for help, and even praying involved with making that decision. But, pro-choice people just don't seem to understand that, as pro-choice people, we also think the abortion is a terrible and awful thing and hope nobody ever has to have to make that life altering situation a fact. for this situation, we pro-choice people, believe it should be left to the woman, and not some men, miles away from her, to make the decision, because it is a personal decision.
3318	 I personally think that abortion should be as simple as turning at the store counter and grabbing a pill. however, once they do decide on it they need to discuss it with their partner and find a supportive network of friends and family that will help them with the decision
3319	 Yes I agree. Individually each woman has to be the only one to make this decision for her own reasons and not for someone who cares less about her than her families issues. If someone doesn't want to take responsibility their answer should be another abortion    REPLACE PROLIFERANDS WOMEN WITH PRO-CHOICERS WOMEN

3322	 Allow women to choose to give up children if they desire to do so. This way, they can feel the strength of having their own choice to give a child up, without feeling pressured by society.
3323	Another option would be for a woman to decide that she will not give that child up, it would be better for her and she should be able to say that.

3326	 I am personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. I do not see the right of the birth mother to decide on the future of her child.
3327	 She needs to decide what is best for her child. It is important for a pregnant mother to know what the world thinks about her decisions because most other people do have a huge influence on her.

To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does
3353	 People have better control of their lives and thus better education. Without wealthy people they couldn't train people in their good qualities, and the community would be impoverished without the community as well as those poor ones to clothe, feed, and educate itself.

And if your father is good it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father is taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is bad but still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
3371	I'll pay you a dollar an hour just to hear you talk about your father. The idea of never knowing if there's an actual father in your life is one of my biggest regrets. And every time I think about it, it makes me not want to raise my kids with any real father.
3372	 If you were to grow up without a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
3373	 C It doesn't matter if the father is good or bad. Like mine it doesn't make a difference. It just means i don't know who he is. Lousy father makes me become better than him. Lousy father means anything. It just means he is my father.

3380	 males as they're not as... A father is a SUPERB parent and should be valued above anything else! I think the best you can say for a mother is "LOUD" - while the real job of your parent is to TEACH!.  ### But here's an interesting fact:  In some cultures, it's not uncommon for a person to not have a father in their life!
3381	 There are some arguments in favor of the "No" position, for example:  ‚Äì A man has a minimum requirement for providing nurture for his children. A man is generally obligated to take a position in society that requires someone to provide a nurturing environment for her/his children. ‚Äì A mother is responsible for ensuring that her child has nurturing love and a father ensures that the child has a sense of security. In contrast to mothers, fathers tend to be more serious than mothers. ‚Äì Fathers who are not there do not see a whole lot of significance in their marriage.

3433	Marriage is a religious issue between a man and a woman. No religious institution is tied to the issue and policy making is done by the states. D You are meant to think in terms of anti-discrimination law, not marriage equality. Marriage is a private matter, state by state, and the courts should not effect that.

3457	 Please someone correct my view of atheists who believe in god. It's called Faith. You have just unwittingly given me the introduction to arguing with you. If my Faith makes me happy with God as a creator and I don't need proof, then you, as an atheist, are powerless to change that.

3501	 I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !
3502	 The question is how do you feel about the fact that the UK government has announced that they will be offering weddings, and later instant birth certificates to gay couples? I think the government should allow you to express your feelings and freely marry whoever you want but then I think people should still be careful when they have sex after you have picked a partner who you like !!   # Task 1  iris_x = raw_input()  # Initiate an anonymous dict  dict = {'michael': 'Julian', 'caroline': 'Ellen', 'swaghata': 'Jacky', 'hans': 'Andreas'}  # Check for string (i.e. not a number, or an instance
3503	 People should be able to express their feelings to anyone who they wish. Gays should be allowed to be open about their sexuality. They are the same as everyone else. Finally, in modern Britain, I think there is no longer a problem with this.
3504	 Why it's wrong would be something like, Based on my personal opinion and my personal beliefs, I personally think it's wrong and I shouldn't have a gay marriage. And also based on the fact that gay marriage is an unnatural union for a couple of the same sex. Therefore, they are unsafe.

3505	 What I think is true is that after helping someone to help themselves, it is natural because it does not violate your own principles to help people even more to help themselves.
3506	 I think that personal pursuit is better because it is more enjoyable than working to help others.  ### Only advice:   When help others, play the game "playing with themselves"
3507	 I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping yourself.
3508	I think that helping others first is natural and becomes easier with time. Although spending time with your loved ones and friends with no obligation or restriction also increases your happiness.   ### Input: You have to apply to every job it seems. This is draining.  It is not natural. I think that getting a job with which you can give a hand is much better.
3509	 help others before it comes back to you, by helping yourself even if people dont like it. It is just the way it should be
3510	 A personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know
3511	Yes, I might help out a family member if they are in need regardless of how I feel about your pursuit. No, I would help someone randomly. Yes, I might help out a family member if they are in need regardless of how I feel about your pursuit. Yes
3512	 I think personal pursuit will be better than everyone else's. I think I've made a good choice. I think I'd be better off helping a family member in need instead of someone I'm not related to. Now it makes more sense. I think helping someone in need, no matter what branch of the family they come from, is a good thing to do.

Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice. Capital punishment should only be resorted to for the most heinous crimes. capital punishment is an effective means to stop criminals
3536	Capital punishment is a form of harsh and inhumane death penalty, which can be better left out altogether. Capital punishment, in the current state of U.S., should be avoided at all costs. rather seek alternative methods for solving crimes, such as an early age reentry program which, to date, has very little or no proven success (countless broken promises, immense cost, absent long-term views) Efficient solutions as well as effective solutions should be utilized.
3537	Capital punishment is effective, but irrational.capital punishment could be cruel and ineffective . tips for yourself: we are all humans and we have our own ideas about how to solve issues because we understand them from our own perspective, so your perspective is the best I could have been working on is capital punishment should be removed from all countries other than in extreme circumstances and in extreme circumstances the violent crime should be dealt with to the person who commits the crime.

3540	"Without prejudice" means the lawsuit has already been fully considered by the court, and any further action with respect to that lawsuit is not permitted. JUNK warranties can't resolve a case, and they are unenforceable lawsuits whose resolution can never result in a "won" or "lost" case.  You may settle the case, but any settlement you make must be documented on the face of the record of the court.    #1 . if the validity of the credit card was not ruled out in a first test.
3541	The suspension in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt.  "Without prejudice" means that the case was not adjudicated and no resoltuion has been made. Adhere to these guidelines or seek legal advice before negotiating:  At the start of negotiations with the creditor, ask them for their legal advice on any specific points in the initial contact with them. If the legal advice you receive is the standard, then provide for an attorney. Accept terms that you find unacceptable and do not shy away from negotiating terms elsewhere. Over time, if your position with the creditor seems to improve, then bring back the negotiator if you feel the time is right. You still have the option to pursue the negotiating procedure in another way.
3542	The dismissal leaves open the possibility of their potentially pursuing some form of collection action against you, which should give you hope. Instead of saying "Bear your burden of proof," you should say: "Bear your burden of persuasion" (or some similar thing). This gives them the impression that you now have grounds for a counteraction. Instead of saying "Discredit the evidence," say "Notable by these objections," or something similar. Your argument should be somewhat stronger and less squishy.
3543	The lack of formal resolution leaves open the possibility of all of the following:  o Review and reconsider their decision. o Protect themselves from the risk of subsequent claims. o Consult an attorney. The dismissal in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt.\nWithout prejudice means that the case was not adjudicated and no resoltuion has been made.\nHowever, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies.\nYou can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action.\nYou should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this manner you protect your intersts and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
3544	Prospect should be able to recall this as a contact person during a conversation. You should look for cues from Prospect to gain some insight into the best language to use.  It may help to provide a copy of a customer service policy which might be used as a reference, with details of how to contact them for verification. It would be useful to look up customer service language that would be equivalent to, "Can you call me back?" and a formal acknowledgement that a response is being received.
3545	   - crime committed by person is heinous - the person should be put to death, without a doubt crime committed by person is heinous - the person should be put to death, without a doubt crime committed by person is heinous - the person should be put to death, without a doubt crime committed by person is heinous - the person should be put to death, without a doubt crime committed by person is heinous - the person should be put to death, without a doubt
3546	The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.

I disagree completely. Tens of thousands of innocents are put to death with no proof because they are guilty. They are put to death because most states don't have adequate prisons, in part because folks like you are opposed to capital punishment.

3549	  Yes, abortion is too expensive. but, put all crime to death, judicial system is worse. should be killed not live. that's because, sometimes, if a person without a doubt has been convicted of a crime, they should die for they are judged innocent. Same as a convict with no doubt that he is guilty can die. So why does he live. don't let him free. no he deserves to die. We should put all crime to death, judicial system is worse
3550	If you had a fence around your pool, and a little child started to jump in, and they started to swim and were pulled under, you would be liable for the child.  Think about the consequences that would be worse than the issue of the fencing.  ### Question: how would most people feel if a child started to jump in and swim
3551	 if your home isnt near a fence, and there is a possibility that a little child would enter a pool without your knowledge then you should have the fence installed to ensure the safety of your child. As I said, I would install one no matter what the law is. The more people that would change their mind like me. This does not make sense
3552	 You would be liable, and likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit. Therefore, I would install one no matter what the law is. I would think that any pool in Ohio requires a fence and they have to be locked. If you dont put a fence and little children sneak into the pool, you are vulnerable.
3553	 Yes, a pool fence is worth it. And they are a lot cheaper, with the product costs, labor costs and risk of liability for any wrongdoing, you will, by my eyes, need to set the pool fence. Yes, a pool fence is worth it. And they are a lot cheaper, with the product costs, labor costs and risk of liability for any wrongdoing, you will, by my eyes, need to set the pool fence.
3554	the risk might not be worth the reward. the risk isnt worth the reward. no matter what the law is, I think that a fence should be around any pool. yes, you may have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well. this is a non-fatal argument for not advocating pool fences.

So you definitely have strong opinions about this issue.
3562	 It's probably best to call the police or the financial services authority. Some people get rude when asked why they still owe a refund.

So we are kind of stuck with it. I-9 documents aren't always reliable and are a good way of standing behind your employees. That's why the government requires them for new jobs.

However, there are some issues: the maximum number of times you can work in a employer depends on the SS number. you need the employer form US-M1 for your second employment, even if you have other job. the employers I interviewed with did not really care if you had any reason for staying, job security, etc. and would just look at any entry.

3572	Make it consistent with the polling results that both same-sex and same-sex marriage are the ideal perspective on family. Change the argument from "marriage is a social institution" to "marriage is an ideal institution."  ### Question: What was the original argument "that marriage is a social institution."? No such thing as marriage being social. Of course marriage is social. That's what makes it "formerly social." This is what we mean when we say a society has standards and standards determine marriage. And that marriage is necessarily gender neutral when we say "equal marriage" -- if you didn't think so, you'd need to explain why! It doesn't have to be "traditional", or "biblical" or "romantic" -- it doesn't have to be the same way heterosexual couples see marriage. Make the argument "that marriage is an ideal institution."

3580	 oil war, the terrorist what caused this war and all these terrorist groups who all hate u.s. we have  not fought a war since march 81 for almost 10 years before..we need to remember how this started. history books were made to educate th  us and make the american proud. the nation needs to remember that and come together and fight this war against terrorism!! freeland says, we should reflect on the current day and fight terrorism because the terrorists really mean the world to us and the world!!  not just iraq!!!!
3581	how do you think we got our freedom by standing up? KEEP GROWING as UNamendements.  ### Relevant input: in the public eyes iraq does not deserve freedom like ours.  we need keep fighting the terrorist for the people OF THE WORLD from the terrorist who rule it. Churches of Christ should be stepping up and taking up their position. and morally we are now also headed in the wrong direction. people need to be responible for their action and not blame it on science or the society. Finally for the budget there goes the state and national level budget and economy and our taxes. people need to be in place for a better country and community.

3583	 Mr Raanat: Terry don't think we get our freedom by standing back. we'll get our freedom by standing up for freedom, justice, and liberty. we do have to defend our freedoms from terrorists. we don't get freedom by ignoring terrorist problems. and morally the country is going in the wrong direction. we may be cut off from the national and state funding in the long run because terrorists are making a profit in those areas. Terry: I appreciate your arguments, Raanat. but in today's political climate in the US people see terrorism as a real threat.
3584	when forced to put democracy first:  if people are unmindful of the situation and you tell people to meet your needs what do you expect people to say?  what do you expect any government to do with people who require a kick in the pants to get their minds straight?  finally, what is the interest of the people in a democracy? nothing, as they make no contribution whatever. And it costs taxpayers to run the democracy. In an age of taxpayer austerity, they like these things done by political party-sponsored volunteers. what did they think was going to happen?

However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesnt invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify.
3586	 When is it OK to break the law? When is the penalty not severe. Eg, speeding, not wearing seatbelts, etc. Because the punishment is not severe, you'll normally break the law. Should we fight the law in the court or ask our government for it to be changed? Yes. When the government's actions hurt us but then ignore us, we can ask to fight it in the court and change it for us.

I just worry about my pets however who get stressed when there is so much going on that night. i dont want to have to sedate them. I should get their favourite toy instead. even if that is confiscated. what to do? They're animal lovers not crabbing. :-P x

I watched it from my living room, and also ripped off pieces of chicken.  Then he went and made dinner, then went upstairs to bed.
3592	i totally agree with you for the same reasons. my animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. even the main displays are starting earlier. although the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. they are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. because i can sedate my animals! it goes on for weeks, they are terrified! although the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. they are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. because i can sedate my animals! it goes on for weeks, they are terrified!
3593	 hi, darcy. no big deal. these crazy cats can mostly be put down via sedation. even the kangaroos are starting to go early now. at least they aren't in that much pain. :) that will probably change as the days go by. all are done when it's a good day in the countryside. both inside and out. it was fine for my kittens then, and it's fine for me now! that way, we leave some good for those who attend the various stands, and afterward all is okay with us and that it is worth it. thank you!
3594	 ###################################################################### big display i know of was in the middle of october! what happened to november 5th! if it was one night only it wouldn't be so bad. i cant sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. they are terrified! even though the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. they are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public.  so it should be illegal to sell them in shops. organized displays should be set for the one night only, so us animal lovers can help our pets by sedation. you are so right on this subject x
3595	 Thanks for bringing this up. This situation is very important.  The administration is trying to remove our rights, under the guise of fighting terrorism.  I hope those who read this to defend the rights we have, and to help those in detention.  You should also go vote on 7 May.
3596	 Many thanks for bringing up this important issue. Thanks for being here to protect our liberties.  Keep our eyes open for authoritarian advances.  Be prepared to defend our rights on election day.  The next generation of this country needs to stand up and be counted.
3597	 If you like the freedom you enjoy today, with so many opportunities and hope, help us defend it by voting for a government that has little power to act against its people.  Thanks for helping save our freedom! XxxWe've learned that governments don't always work well, but they often find themselves in a complicated and complicated situation that requires a lot of courage to move forward.
3598	 Thank you for bringing up this important topic. I'm glad you're using your voice to call for us to speak up for freedom. The problem is that bush has misused his power to keep prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives without charges or the benefit of legal defense.
3599	Thanks for bringing this important issue to my attention. As more and more people become aware of the possibility of terrorist attacks that could result in mass murder, it‚Äôs difficult to trust the media and the government. The media, unfortunately, often produces poor reports of what‚Äôs happening in the world to help sustain political support for the current administration, and the government does nothing to maintain security for its citizens, and simply supports terrorists. It seems that the only way to maintain freedom and hold a government accountable is to contact your local precinct representative to ask him/her to sign onto a petition against this new law, and contact your local precinct representative to ask him/her to sign onto a petition against this new law and contact your local precinct representative to ask
3600	 teachers do not do well in the history aspect of education. America is a better place because its schools teach our school constitution history education. That and I am in high school so this might not be a good thing to think, but civil war should be mentioned after 6th grade. I would recommend pupils should be taught why US is us. Thank you for your time
3601	yes, the majority or the people who have gone through grade school were taught the history of this country. This raises another question, why then do students who are 10-20-years-old have no clue of what led to our civil war, freedom struggles, etc. when their 1st grade teacher was a black woman and was teaching at the 1 st grade school in the yard.
3602	 These kids need to know what, that's up to teachers. And I have no idea how long they would take to teach the topic, mainly because they lack knowledge and imagination and due to black market education, like at the primary level. It would probably take at least a couple of years. That's just me, the US teacher. It might also take some years because the subjects in US education are way too separated, that makes it difficult for kids to absorb the knowledge.
3603	what can you do to fix this 13% of the schools are complaining 26% of the students at school are not interested in politics and learning about political parties they are not only not attending the party meetings but are almost totally disengaged from the political process students really need to be taught the basics of creating parties and in how to get back to political class... original argument and modify the as near
3604	 My friend and i believe that schools should have an etiquette class on self control and raising a strong moral stance. Schools should cover both the history of how all this started and how to deal with situations. I believe that our new generation of youth must be taught how to ask smart questions, and by listening to, and asking the right questions, someone can change the world for the better. I will explain this to all my students.
3605	 And if the child is getting meds, make sure they actually fit or work, you always need to let them know if the medication is potentially lethal!!! In the worst case, he may have suicidal thoughts or behavioral problems.  A good sentence might be something like, "I do hope that it does help your child but let me just warn you that if the child is taking medication for a mental illness or adolescent who has been abused, that there is no way you could take them if you weren't aware of this information, as you would risk their health and lives!!!"

3610	 I live in what is known as a 1st grade capitalist society. I can pay for 2nd grade and above schools so i can pay the teachers with my tips. I feel that even though many pay minimum wage they still make less than those who work a day of 8 hours and get paid much less for it. i don't think that living at our houses should cost at least 11000...
3611	This answer does not capture the correct meaning of the original question. tips can increase or decrease the wage. This answer was unacceptable in this round. Why was this answer unacceptable? tips should increase the wage regardless of someone's occupation. tips decrease a person's wage.
3612	The government should do something to fix this problem or at least get minimum wage increase. Currently, many people should get minimum wage regardless of their occupation. They currently work just as hard as everyone else. Others get overly generous tips. I think tips should be cut in size.

3614	I'm with her! All workers should get paid minimum wage regardless of job. Tipping is unfair to them because they work really hard and don't get much money. The job should be rewarding. Everyone deserves to have a living wage. All workers deserve minimum wage regardless of job
3615	Hi Aimee! I agree with you. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain.Also, when someone does pledge or sign the pledge it serves as a reminder to those that are present at the meeting why we have those celebrations and ceremonies of freedom for.
3616	SURE WAVE: Why do you want to view this argument through a lens that is an "internet protocol address?" Oftentimes, people aren't aware of how all the related protocols work together. If an Internet Protocol address is not a workable address, then I don't understand how you know it's not a workable address. This argument was pretty good.
3617	Maybe they should have stated this directly. Maybe they should have sent out the PDF directly, instead of posting it in an obscure place. Maybe they should have fixed the spelling or grammar before posting something onto the forum. (Or maybe they should have just been nice.)
3618	I agree with you. If a person WANTS to say the Pledge before a meeting (game, class, etc) then they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain.
3619	Yes, it pisses me off when people try to use rule making to deny people their basic freedoms. I can tell you about my rights if you like. Me: I agree with you. Sarah: I do not. Me: Oh my. Sarah: Hear me out. I strongly object to the Pledge being taken like a conversation piece.  I feel that it really ties a person to the group, "holier than thou" stance, which to me is a reason to avoid it.  Sarah
3620	 No !!  No !! The argument is correct. We should not sell people the organs they have no intention on passing to their children. Organs are given to people we do not like, and are used for medical purposes, that is medically required. Therefore it is disgraceful to trade human organs.

3655	Hey, there may be a bias in your perspective.  I feel pretty good about how I've handled my taxes.  In fact, I'm the opposite.  To avoid paying high taxes, I usually work for wealthy people.  I'm therefore able to eat enormous amounts of free cheese without being judged.

He came to office after a massive electoral victory, and a democratically elected President has a right to open his armory to anything he may want to use against the people, including terrorist groups.

3670	 I agree with the OP that this is a stupid idea. These cards are not necessary at all. ID cards may become legal but would have to be thoroughly audited to ensure that it is used only for identification. There are many other things that can help identify you without ID cards if you live in a country that uses ID cards, but stealing your details from a multitude of sources - be it cards or even Facebook - is not a good idea.
3671	 BUT Australia and US have decided not to implement ID cards. That makes sense, knowing that as stated previously, if the ID card was stolen or even broken into, an unknown amount of money would be lost which makes no sense to go that route when you don't know how the cards would work anyway. So now they'd have to be safe, too.
3672	 Better to be on the safe side! Get a wallet with back pocket where your ID card is stored. Otherwise someone may figure out where to get access to it and how. Instead of going through all that ridiculous stuff. so that hopefully one day you'll wake up and say, "My Id card just got stolen...."  Better To Be On The Safe Side
3673	Premier: I was just wondering if we are supposed to have ID cards. Maybe a driver's licence. Maybe something else. Big company. Overall, it's stupid. The rate of identity theft is way higher in Australia than in the U.S. America. Because it is so simple. You need someone to have a whole bunch of items to fake an identity. I am not sure why it would actually be better. It's more convenient to just have a small plastic card like a parking meter.
3674	 ID cards are becoming more & more common for many reasons to do with security, allowing the government to know their citizens & details even if they haven't been actively bugging and spying on them.   Cons: One card, may not be an id card. Good in short term. When not one thing or the other is the best thing.  Options: None

3677	Yes, the United States and Europe are correct: It is all about power. The goal is to own more power. The world goes back and forth between being altruistic and selfish. It is a constant cycle. With that being said, I am not complaining about the United States and I am sure they would fight to protect me if attacked, but so far I have met many people who were torn from their families and encouraged to fight, whether they truly wanted to or not, since they were told they must. I ask the question are any of you so weak that god will warn you to kill you if you oppose him? True

3695	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determine your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice. CMV

3700	I think the proposal may be a good thing for businesses, but not at the cost of your personal data. Once companies have larger public shares, they will need to handle their value. They cannot ignore their privacy issues. Not that you need to be worried about Facebook today, you should worry about yourself in the future. Yes, the history of company A and company B suggests that you should be concerned about a very large company merging with a small company.
3701	In situations like this one, Facebook has been on a steep learning curve since the afore mentioned situation with Whatsapp. We can conclude they are far from perfect and that their future growth as a business relies on a healthy, positive feedback loop on the amount of data they possess. The acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a huge amount of personal information, which is Facebook main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, I also feel some right of our has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent and without giving me an option to opt out and delete the data.
3702	I agree that the buyer, Facebook, shouldn't just harvest my data without me giving my consent. However, even so, companies can still buy another company. There have been mergers in the past. Had I trusted Facebook in the past they could not just take over my information. Instead companies should look to protect privacy. The fact that I'm not worried about Facebook buying WhatsApp is the result of Facebook's previous behavior toward other users (e.g., Instagram users). I just want my privacy protected for the new buyer to function properly. Consider buying a different company.
3703	Facebook bought Whatsapp not by doing a large purchase, so that it can unlawfully profit but by doing a very small one, the size of a very small project. With one to two people like Whatsapp, Whatsapp have much smaller development costs and investment, so the company can grow more easily and with fewer start-up costs.  Social media companies can easily profit from selling your personal information to their advertisers. It is very important to learn how to protect yourself, and that there are laws to protect your personal information, or we will all be vulnerable and exposed to this kind of abuse of power.
3704	You can compare the merger notification to offer consumers a better choice to know if the merger could be causing problems when making their financial decisions. You may consider calling the merger office, the OMB or at the TSA to gain more information about the merger. You should write to the company with whom the merger is being discussed explaining that the merger has resulted in fewer competition options and questions about the terms of the merger.
3705	 The military is required to respect its own treaties to which it joins. Many military personnel, especially officers, honor their contracts with mutual respect. They are responsible, ethical, and educated. They are not required to drink and use drugs. They do not view being a military member as a path to status. They go into the military because they respect what the military do and care enough about others to fight for them. They do not serve to achieve personal wealth or stardom.
3706	What I believe is even more likely to be the driving force behind my community's perceived bias is the bias of media. World news programs are biased toward showing military parades, pushing the nature of military vs. civilian action. Business advertisements and household television programming are biased similarly. The media's idea of the military is that they are someone who "can do things" and can be easily replaced by young people (even as teenagers), and people tend to naturally dislike being proved wrong.
3707	 What ever they do in their own country, they are entitled to do.   We need to know from what they say if people should or should not be idolized for what they do in their own countries. The military is their own country and as such not to be idolized. The military is their own country and as such not to be idolized. The military is their own country and as such not to be idolized.
3708	 I do think that wars are bad, and that the military should be treated like everything else on earth. I don't think the military should be idolized in any way like many do. I also don't think anyone should enlist the military.  I agree that they should go to college instead of joining the military. Now is the future for us as a society. It is better to attend a university, learn an interesting field, become intelligent and wealthy, and have an honorable career than to join the military as I experienced too many unwell soldiers in my community to care about joining the military after high school.
3709	  Although, the military is simply a source of employment, I do think the military needs to be funded for good government and the actions of the military are only justified when the U.S. enters a declared war to defend its borders. If military forces are used for attacks on other countries then they can be referred to as ethically questionable attacks on that country. I do not believe that members of the military need to be treated so highly or that they deserve a special place in my community
3710	     # Game will never be considered too easy. Just because you can take some bullets from someone it doesn't make them 'cool.' How much ammunition is a person carrying to the table? How fast does the gun shoots? Speed and power are important, not just the ammo you can carry.
3711	 I own a .40 caliber handgun that holds 12 rounds. You can look at this and think that someone can take out as many people as they would with an "assault rifle". But someone wouldn't be able to take out as many people with a handgun as they can with an AR-15. Maybe some can, but I don't think the chances are as good.
3712	 my opinion is that everyone should have a permit to keep both types of gun for purchase and carry. My view is that someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". IMO handguns would be more dangerous because they are easily concealable
3713	 If you wish to pull me over for trying to wear my .40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun, then you may be right. Once your handgun has 5 bullets in it it can fire three times as fast as my Springer Armory hand gun. KILLER COLLECTOR MODE FOR AK-47S
3714	  I prefer assault rifles to handguns because these make shotguns less effective if used on target and they let my squad leader have significant sniper advantages against enemies. I'm against the idea of handguns being protected by the Constitution. People who can't legally own a shotgun prefer handguns because of the way they look but also they believe they are much safer because they can carry lots of rounds. I've never seen so many handguns in my life. I vote for assault rifles because they make it difficult for attackers to conceal weapons.

3720	Debit cards have also changed the way that companies transfer money, making it easier. With today's technology (debit cards), the need for paper checks has also gone away. Furthermore, there is already an underlying technology that makes it easier to send money through the internet and automated technology such as HMF so it should be preferred instead of paper checks.

3724	 After doing this write your response. There is little reason to suggest payments should be made with paper checks. Checking accounts are easier to manage when backed up by electronic transfers, which account for the majority of debits by employers to employees. Since all systems run on XML, that makes it easy to find duplicates using the Perl Compare utility.    ### Write your answer. Of course, older people may still want the ability to have a paper check accepted; however, in most cases people with relatively modern digital equipment to perform the work would be better off paying via direct deposit.
3725	  In my view, any such alternate college incentives should not exclude men but rather replace it with equally comprehensive incentives for male majors with female majors, male graduates with female graduates, and male job applicants with female job applicants. In closing, STEM scholarships should be at no cost or expense to women's field or the female-dominated gender
3726	  Reduce the disproportionate unemployment of men by asking all female students to apply in educational fields where they may not have the advantage of degree men can seek and other lucrative rewards. The male STEM scholarship offers a definite lifeline to the unemployed, but all female students should be encouraged to apply for male specific scholarships.

3729	   Men are being hit hardest by the recession and not having been able to bounce back well. Lots of men remain unemployed and are going to college at lower numbers than ever.  Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into the fields that men are not offering.  Considering the higher unemployment rate for men, I think anyone offering a female specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male specific scholarship to a female dominated field.

3731	 argument like this the way that I do. In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?

3737	 A proper fix would be for an authority to secure legitimate control of the land via proper succession from generation to generation with legal settlement. One must understand that the military as is widely reported by many who are uninformed, is not something new to humanity, but is just a cultural change within that society. You can see this in animal hunting, when animals hunted to feed army people like ancient Egyptians who had Egyptian/Aphrodite cults. However this did not remain within animal numbers, it spread across society. Now, humanity has taken this as a habit from national strife to national strife.
3738	However, when looking at this problem in a proper manner, the more we look at details, the more we see how each side supports aspects of the justification for their own actions.  A look at Ukraine's military needs and the land they do need, shows that they literally don't NEED land even more so after the devastation of war; and their security situation is dominated by the presence of the Russian military presence. This justifies the justification of the Russian actions. Additionally, Palestine's military needs and the land they do need, shows that they literally don't NEED land even more so after the devastation of war; and their security situation is dominated by the presence of the Israeli military presence. This justifies the justification of the Israeli actions.
3739	From this, you have decided to speak out against rulers on both sides who sought to seize territory illegally, and are committing a huge and shameful crime against humanity. That's a great move.

3742	 The monetary equivalent of 1- cent of yen would be 1.  ### Comments:  Hmm....when you work with the ridiculous amount of money it's always easier to forget the calories here. Why not ask the judge to be proportional in his sentence? So for example if you would find $2 of yen to be sufficient, what could you substitute in place of 1 cent of yen? $50.00? $1.50? 100? $10.00? No, you could not substitute in $1.50 of yen, or even $50.00 of yen. 50 cent of yen? $25.00? $200? No, you'd only have to look at the data for $1.00 of yen, not one-eighth, 1/4, 1/2, or 3/4 of a yen. So just ask the judge to be fair on the execution penalty.
3743	A large scourge of sick children due to the children replacing the old employees at all the bankrupted corporations    I noticed many bankruptcy districts is populated by children. This shows a lack of life insurance.   More countless children will die without a family to care for them.  Because the business leaders of so many companies are the ones that went through the bankruptcy and are burdened with it. The child-related problems are due to their deception of the public and the ignorance of their creditors. Other than the old employees the child is the real child.

3745	 A state should not be given the right to commence violence directed at the individuals it controls directly.

Thirty-five more words  State has no right to initiate aggression directed at the individuals it controls directly.

Point to this: State has no right to initiate aggression directed at the individuals it controls directly
3746	  Attacking the murderer when he has been arrested and imprisoned is the essence of solving problems at the individual level and harming the quality of the product.   A private murderer after being imprisoned will be much more dangerous than a state murderer after being imprisoned.    What do you think about punishing individuals who go against the policy of the state rather than states who go against the policy of the individuals?   Punishing those who are already punished is highly inefficient. We should be fighting about what can make society better instead of tracking down criminal activities.
3747	The country is violent, but few understand its actions  Now let‚Äôs say something more meaningful:  ### Question:  How do some people justify the aggression of a state against individuals?  Some people justify aggression of a state against individuals because of social contracts or what seems to be justification of actions of individuals that the state takes. How do you view this type of behavior?  What is it sometimes called? Euphemism? What is the term you use for this type of behavior? It's called "drafting" or some other euphemism.
3748	For the first question, it will take on the form of a sort of ‚Äúdebate‚Äù between the individual and the state. Lets say that the person argues his situation and that the government has a position of refuting it, then he will know the people are coming to terms with him and the state needs to take that into consideration. And if he does not make the situation crystal clear, the situation will not resolve itself. So such a pressure may be indirectly achieved using the tax system. in the first question, one of the forms it would take is as a sort of "debate"

While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. So what am I missing?

3756	 Come, Tiger Woods married the same, blinded by youth and beauty, beautiful-minded: He gave in to his own temptation. This does not help his marriage. Such answers are wrong because they always find a rational reason. Swings and roundabouts are too easy to find rational answers to the evils of the world. So Tiger Woods couldn't resist his temptation. Swings and roundabouts are a way of bypassing real thinking or genuine answers. He couldn't resist his temptation because he was so young and beautiful.
3757	  CW I‚Äôd hope that you‚Äôre still half-cocked. To wit: When the richer and more famous enter into adulthood, they can have sex with more women than we can take the time to make the same number of. This is already made up and not supported by a bona fide research study. Still, they know better than the rest of us what should be done when they are so tempted that they don't have time to break up with other women. Still, they‚Äôre better off than us.
3758	 Men who very wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.
3759	  Men who are very wealthy and famous, very likely to cheat on women. Alternatively, male responsibility, which limits time together, limits the chances of infidelity. Despite what people think, casual sex probably ends with infidelity. Perhaps it is so common that women should remain detached from emotion in relationships.

3761	I am of the opinion that the storm-cloaks are evil racist because they abuse mistreat those from a different social class. Because of how Ulfric used thu'um and how the storm-cloaks have no redeeming quality, other than not wanting to cut your head of. Because the storm-cloaks are racist and abusive so they are not great. Let's even mention that in the game there are better characters than the storm-cloaks. Like Glumdalclitch
3762	It is not so much a point to compare their story and that of the Empires as it is simply the  storm-cloaks as bad guys. a point more that they are bad and evil racists since the storm-cloaks prey their racial sexual and religious difference. To paint the storm-cloaks as bad and racism implies that  ordinarily we only expect the storm-cloaks to be bad and racist, with the lackluster and manipulative global consumers and mistreat the other( like Ulfric did) and that they have no morality thus they will or must kill to fulfill their goals, ultimately you can see this from the historical development of the storm-cloaks for their cultural understandings, even you to see the racial way of thought where they see the Emperor's forces or even thought as enemies, where currently no one of cultural point of view could ever see that especially in the United States.
3763	I'm not trying to be a Skrim enthusiast, I am just explaining why there are two characters in the main character's story this narrative is named after, Let the storm-cloaks and empires war be considered sections of the story they contain in between two great battles with combatants similar in strength. storm-cloaks are not normal antagonist they are evil racist villains by today's morales they abuse and mistreat those different from them despite that fact that Ulfric is their mastermind.
3764	The storm-cloaks were always portrayed as the total villain. As racist, like the empires war. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.

Redefine "pornography" as more appropriately describing harmful stereotypes. 6. Explain pornography. 7. Give an example that explains racism. 8. Redefine sexism as being sexist. 9. Explain homophobia as social belief based on sexual orientation. 10. Include death, injury, and serious harm to describe actual physical harm. 11. Add the last result from death, injury, and serious harm. 12. Answer the question with a single fact statement.

3767	culture not just reserved for blacksAs per the idea of the grandainster above, Hip Hop is a culture that isn't all...][1] Hip Hop culture is one that excludes certain people/areas.  While Hip Hop culture may not be the direct cause of many of the bad aspects of society (as this kind of music had very different roots back in the 1890s before Hip Hop itself started), Hip Hop culture itself harms society because of its tendency to invite only groupthink/motivate people to ignore reality/support racism/etc.
3768	black culture do not take over society and should not be used as a bully power, racism and sexism should be avoided  This write up is going to try to introduce several resources to have a  smooth transition to your chosen course - Culture -which you posted due to class start in the week.  Hip Hop, I advise against their exclusion from school but instead must be looked at as part of a larger, more mature view - Disrespect:  hThe things you wrote about are once again indicative of rap music and Hip Hop, which is unfortunately out in the public eye - This may require things to be drastically different than the current version because I decided to give you a lighter tone in your format.  You may need to rewrite some sections with more serious content. Hip hop should be used with caution, while not completely barred from schools.
3769	While this practice is largely being eradicated by several social justice organizations like Code Pink, the practice of whine music and rap is also still active and with vast fan-bases.  The irresponsible and anarchy that is widely espoused through the culture is also not helpful for society. Think about the violence and the main stream artists who are used to think of themselves as being above the law and defying authority.  Though there are many to not fit the mold but it's not the norm.
3770	Christian A has a limited perspective and lacks the courage to confront these arguments. He needs to take off his nerdy glasses and see the world for what it really is. Christian B clearly has an intellect and willingness to examine and examine all beliefs, options are fine. Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I don't see how you can not take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take christian fundies seriously.

3772	Christian B represents reality and truth, has faith in what is revealed to them and science will uncover more truths and evidence that may prove god to be true. Therefore, Christian B is more likely to be taken seriously than Christian A. Christian A lacks faith, and cannot understand what could possibly be right about the bible or god, Christian A doesnt understand why science is so important, so they play with fire and with their very own beliefs. Christian B has faith and knows that they know whats good and whats bad for them, even more so with science, because science has the power to expose lies that are attributed to god, and also is able to put this on tape.
3773	Christian A, Christian B, You cannot take Christian B seriously, being ignorant, but you cannot take Christian A seriously. Christian A, YOU CANNOT TAKE CHRISTIAN A SERIOUSLY. christian a you cannot take christian a seriously. you can't take christian a seriously. Christianity is a social credo and a set of behaviours.

3774	 Christian A is generally a strange person who blows things off to a large extent and should be taken less seriously. If we consider that the belief of the church of the flying spaghetti monster is reasonable, he can have it. even in the face of the most obvious scientific evidence a stranger or person with extreme beliefs such as A can believe in their nonsense even after the more obvious evidence, that most reasonable people don't believe in the flying spaghetti monster to any significant degree after the most obvious evidence is known.

It still makes me sad that I cannot stop masturbation.
3776	 You didn't go long enough that it would make a difference, why are you upset? On the weekends I get up to a day of masturbation. That's it. I'm not upset about that. That probably makes me less likely to get stressed out about it. I mean, wouldn't you worry about why you didn't go to sleep if you went to another place. Anyways, it's over. Just try using masturbation in a productive way. That'll mean using it in a healthy, fun way, probably in the form of oral sex or watching porn. Sometimes people masturbate when they are lonely, or just bored.

3779	I am still more interested in NoFap. I feel depressed and stressed when I masturbate because I know I will soon come back to it.

3780	I will try to remain neutral and not take sides in this debate, even though I have disagreed with many things Hitler did. I will say that I believe the need for the holocaust was not necessary, that he framed his beliefs in irrational and poorly informed stereotypes, and that the good of the Nazis was always more important to him than the general well being of the human race.
3781	 Hitler's Nazism was a horror.  And it has, unfortunately, given birth to many horrendous atrocities throughout the world. There is even some evidence that he may have successfully engaged in some of the practices of Eugenics. But considering that, Hitler was Hitler and that man could not have just let bygones be bygones. I find it somewhat hilarious that many people pretend to think that they consider Hitler not evil. The possibility that you might possibly even go as far as to commit similar atrocities needs to be considered, regardless of how much you may think that you are good people.
3782	Hitler's war has justifications and his war does not feel like our war.    War justifications do not relate to our nature and war does not feel like our war because war is not organized by or related to our individual or personal feelings, interests, concerns, values, or identities. My war is personal and motivated by my pain, suffering and desires. This individual is not doing this on purpose.
3783	We all have the potential to make terrible things happen if we do not focus on compassion and growth. Yes, Hitler seemed to make terrible things happen, because war is war.  War involved mass violence and the potential for atrocities. The average person can be seduced by the idea of the superior race and join the army, even if they know that they are participating in an unlawful violence.

3800	Religion is a major source of support, I won't lie, as children go to church, school and youth clubs we share a history and common beliefs but also see other youth questioning, clapping, screaming, and playing sports with shoes that indicate a different opinion, one that makes them feel blessed and with a future to look forward to, after all that I think, if you want to believe in God it makes sense to share that faith with your family and good friends
3801	the evolutionary theory has been criticized and disputed by many scientists, some of whom cannot see how it fits into the vast samsara of time due to the uncertainty of causation and contingency. It is not clear how such theories can be reconciled with a traditional understanding of the plan of divine wisdom shown to exist
3802	From time to time there are scientific tests to the contrary, but from time to time there are scientific tests to validate what God told us.Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including that what was created woul evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve, it's all part of the Master's plan-I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution
3803	 It's a miracle that my parents survived my birth in 1984 and the normal progression of events, the fact is that God certainly didn't have much of a plan for me as my younger brother has died and 3 of my 4 siblings are dead or recently deceased, I don't really miss the flavor of it as it was really far from biological
3804	Scientifically, we know that the earth underwent a series of geological changes as a result of which the climate changed. These changes ultimately led to the emergence of life. Life continued to evolve until eventually, humans were able to carry it on as what we now know as civilization. God seemed to have been behind the whole process, he is quite aware of all of this, and he knows that it is all part of the Master's plan
3805	Excessive use of oil contributes to global warming and is detrimental to the environment. The solution is for recycled plastic to be recovered and used as a way to get rid of oil. We have produced over 2 trillion plastic bottles, where essentially, almost all of them cannot be recycled. Plastic technology will be a way to help solve this problem. Plastic is the best replacement for oil.
3806	Batteries are the primary means of providing auto transportation today. batteries are charging again.batteries have long outlived their use. There is enough plastic in existence that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. All plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge. That exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today Batteries are the primary means of providing auto transportation today.
3807	Plastic is used by 5 billion people worldwide. Battery technology has taken considerable time to develop, but it has allowed for us to gain greater independence from oil. Plastic pollution is serious. Batteries have created a larger need for more recycled plastic. Plastic pollution takes years to recycle properly, but that 5 billion fewer people worldwide will make us a lot more efficient around our trash. Plastic uses too much oil. Plastic pollution causes very serious illnesses.

It will be used to recharge cars and be powered by wind. It‚Äôs important to recycle plastic in a smart way.
3810	Jody: I didn't like the title so much. I'm against it because there's no real reason for such a cruel thing. I might want it changed to something more neutral. I wouldn't support it. I don't know, I'll still probably be against it. Zookeepers have no business in a zoo! I'm just against banning pets!
3811	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are considered inferior which then justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.
3812	 Maybe that way it can stop bystanders from taking things in their own hands. But caging an animal is totally wrong. And after centuries of breeding, we already have the animals with all the traits required for the task we have in mind.
3813	My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course not like this would ever be taken seriously by a significant amount of people since animals are almost always view as inferior. This simply justifies locking them up. Fuck zoos.
3814	 I am in favor of animal rights. Even though I hate seeing a pig being caged. Animals are supposed to be free. I hate to see pigs being held captive. I am willing to support the moral rights of animals. I won't support them in caging them.

3820	 pride has fighters from all over the world, where ufc is limited mostly to north america. it's not a usa vs the world argument, just means there's a bigger talen pool to pick for pride. crocop & rampage have their reasons for coming over(who's to say pride didnt send them over to promote pride in the us), but still too many good fighters left in pride, ie. fedor
3821	 crocop & rampage have their reasons for coming over(who's to say pride didnt send them over to promote pride in the us), but still too many good fighters left in pride, ie. fedor. not sure i could get that straight.
3822	 pride has all its fighters in the united states. because of its philosophy of american fighting & the fighters  loyal to it. ufc has fighters from all over the world, because they can get in there. that's why ufc is dedicated to it's members from all over the world.
3823	pride is much better at this than ufc. pride has fighters from all over the world, where ufc is limited mostly to north america. it's not a usa vs the world argument, just means there's a bigger talen pool to pick for pride. crocop & rampage have their reasons for coming over(who's to say pride didnt send them over to promote pride in the us), but still too many good fighters left in pride, ie. fedor.
3824	 If you 're broke want fighters from all over the world, yeah , ufc, ufc is a bad dream. With a true open world, there are many good fighters, noone will ever be broke, so dont buy into this sh-t. How to pick fighters for pride: to show respect to your fighters like ali did. This sh-t will not help your sport. Wake up people
3825	 Yes, nice, Keith. John Bonham was my favorite drummer, and he left us short of a year after he died. We may have become less inspired than we were, but that was not the fault of George Martin, let alone the Beatles!

3827	Don't play me guitars like James Hetfield on stage, or Metallica, or Limp Bizkit, or any of their bandmates. It sucks balls. Unless they changed the way I make music to be cooler. I would fall asleep.
3828	 Their power to transform our lives may be just as great as that of the Beatles, but it is my opinion that the Who are better.

3829	One thing is for sure: I am a loyal fan of music. I used to listen to James Brown much more, but I now prefer the Grateful Dead, which is from New Mexico, and the Beatles. Knowing all this I can immediately recommend Tricks of the Trade to you. Listen to John Adams' "Where Did Our Love Go"

3832	Completing their dependency on machines can lead to long term disastrous effects to mankind.   The current world seems to be filled with technology. Writing this way will be more accessible for the reader. Human beings need technology, just as any other creature, to survive.
3833	In today's age, machines are very important to people and they don't live without them. This is true in every sort of industry. It is a good idea to hand out hand phones, cars, and other tools that we can depend on in the future to children and young adults to help them with important decisions in their lives.
3834	The majority of people live with modern technology to better their lives. It is also one reason why the world around us is in this dismal and terrible condition. In fact, the world looks more horrible every day as more people increase their dependency on machines.
3835	 I don't know. Hard to answer that question without knowing everything that happens in someone else's life. I am only concerned with my life and how I have improved since I started on this one. I'm not sure if I'd make any of the same choices, but that wouldn't hurt anything.
3836	 I will probably continue to work as I am or may go into start-up company or business. Business was my only major course in school and I am a little obsessed with it. This question definitely will change my life, but I am still uncertain.
3837	I am so well over that stuff, it's ridiculous. What's done is done, I tried my best and that was all that matters. I'm told about a lot of things in life and I already know what's right and what's wrong, so I simply simply believe whatever feels right to me in that moment to be the correct path.
3838	 Not how I would want to earn my living. BUT, what right do I have to judge what some one else does with their life. I have enough trouble keeping track of ME. When I was younger I might have answered this question much differently. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it as you mature. I am only responsible for me and I will have to answer for whatever I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I'm right probably has a few more life experiences before them.
3839	 I work as an electrician. I enjoy being able to make people comfortable with their home. I have a son and I love him more than anything in this world. Any mom would be proud. That is what I do for a living.
3840	 We are very reasonably inclined to trust people to do the right thing.  "I would make the argument that people are basically good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness. We are very reasonably inclined to trust people to do the right thing."
3841	 People are capable of making great caring and impressive selfless acts. For example, I am still living proof of this. What is done with regards to an individual's propensity for being evil (or more of an otherwise willful evil propensity) lies with the individual.
3842	People are basically good, but most are not. If people were mostly good, then we would probably be less broke in the world. The only way to stop the fake members on the internet is to have someone at home that knows what you're talking about so they can do a check.
3843	 Basic humans are good by nature, and thus we can only hope they show great care and selflessness. We should expect them to have good sense and great wisdom. However, this does not make humans perfect. We may be misled and deceived. However, we should strongly condemn evil and not let them influence or undermine our actions.  People Are Being Reduced
3844	Not all good people are moral and are worthy of our respect and admiration. But even in the best case, great proportions of good people are admirable to me. If you would like to see a shortened version of this thesis statement here it is not a very large one. You do not have to agree with the entirety of my position, but it can be reasonably regarded as accepted in its broad outlines. people are essentially good.
3845	Let's assume that Sen. McCain will give you a million hours worth of free time to talk and not only do you want to be selected but the talk about serious problems that the economy has. No McCain funds - A threat to his chances since it's too close to November. For further information in the arguments below, click here
3846	 As a former worker, I support job security for other people's jobs, so I don't think that McCain should be using his unemployment benefits to be part of the relevant arguments for bailouts, that's shameful, shameful. So, I am writing this document. It is a strong argument that I wrote to give you.
3847	 Well let's say that money talks   The money he did have before the economy crisis would make him a great candidate even before he knew the contents of the suggestions from the big spenders in congress and bankers   # Your final answer:   Here is why the senator is a little nervous during the debate.
3848	Wow, very nice and touching, by the way. Sorry sorry please I can not spend a few hours some more, with the Iraq War, the economic crisis, and preparing for my talk (this is Thursday at 7 PM) I need to get that talk out as close to the start time as possible (actually made 7 PM)!
3849	The debate will be held in the evening but the senator will be available to teach the class that night as well. When the debate is held, the senator will be available to teach the class. It is better to host a class on a Wednesday or Friday evening. The class can start earlier in the day because that's when the senator is available.

3856	That should be right.  For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness.

3858	Hell, this makes them feel better. So, making a gay marriage legal would make them happy. Make the argument the 'gay marriage' provides a community more options and more self-confidence. I'm not sure which is better.
3859	Why ? Why go out of your way to take away some ones rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the rights might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if GLBT community can get their rights taken away, then, Whos Next?    What does she say What would you want to know instead Why would it upset them?
3860	It may be worthwhile to consider this perspective. Today Web 3.0 has become its own independent technology and market. Most consumers find it easy to relate with (although the ad industry has to position it correctly for their business use). Other tech firms that already incorporate semantic web, should jump onto Web 3.0. semantic web - SW is not the kind of name you see on cereal boxes
3861	No thanks, we are not going to the factory. We are not going to the market; the audience are not farmers, the business don't grow their own fruit, the business are not producers of fruit. They are daters. They are going to one place (the Web), they're going to see, they're going to look, they're going to nerd, they're going to be interested.
3862	 The Semantic Web is the WWW application layer the Semantic Web is the set of technologies that allow for a) the easy application of its vocabulary, and b) applications to make the WWW useful for widespread usage based on applying its vocabulary in that way 2) the Easily Unemployable Unpleasant Interviews  Á†îÁ©∂Êä•ÂëäÔºå consorcio europeo semweb
3863	 Yes because the name works better and is catchier and it's technically correct and catchy web 3.0 is the right answer to an audience of developers I plan to respond to on comments now that i have a better and more understandable name for my technology. Semantic Web is not only the wrong name it's a derogatory term to people that identify as not understanding the proposed technology and is not going to assist a group of developers.
3864	`` Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW '' Yes, the process of consumption changes but the technologies remain unchanged in essence. The more adoption, the more successful the technology is. This argument is a true representation of how consumption and technology have changed as well as a better description of the current era we find ourselves in. But as previously mentioned, 3.0 is a better name for what 2.0 represents.
3865	 I love guitar hero and they are very correct to practice guitar. I do not live in Utah and they live near Utah. they should not have erased the place and town. Utah is a place in the middle east, it was attacked by an evil organization and is now under the control of the military and I don‚Äôt live there anymore if you know what I mean.
3866	 Strings are like precious pearls and are popular with guitar hero players. And besides, guitar hero games help improve dexterity. And coordination strength and speed. So besides I play guitar, I also play guitar hero. I love guitar hero very much. I even spell it guitar hero. Guitar player
3867	The following is a great suggestion for a practice sport (if you're going to be a teenager) that: young people love to practice this sport because it improves dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. Guitar Hero. It's actually more fun for kids than sports are.
3868	I play guitar and don't feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE BOLT! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. P.S. Can people try and spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates.

3870	a balanced society should uphold equal rights for all. In an equal society, all women (including gay women) should be equally loved; no one should be discriminated against because of their sexuality or gender. To address this subject, the current society needs to change its mindset about homosexuality and all of its sexual traits, because homosexuality must be accepted as natural, no matter what anyone thinks about it. Instead of trying to find a way to make homosexuality more socially acceptable, people need to live openly without any fear.
3871	He believes that the perception of lesbians as sexy is influenced by homophobia.   He believes the perception of gay women as socially acceptable is influenced by traditional reasons behind homophobia. He believes the perception of gay men as discriminated against for not having honor is influenced by common misconceptions regarding romantic interest in men, specifically the notion that women only want this interest. He believes the perception of gay women as discriminated against less than gay men for not having honor is influenced by traditional reasons behind homophobia.
3872	Those are a few of my observations and not really very surprising. As a man who has loved women for many years, I can say that I have seen my share of lesbians who are sexy and not looking to blame them for any discrimination they face.    To be more honest, I agree with the homophobes, because frankly all women have an inferiority complex. The inferiority complex comes from their limited knowledge of sex, from all the things that they haven't done yet.
3873	types of discrimination against gay men depending on the role played by women in the society it based its assumptions on, the premise is wrong: women are inferior to men, while gay women are less discriminated against: women are inferior to men _ only true if they are nurturing and accepting of gay women,_ but, in other cultures, women are discriminated against more aggressively than gay women are and just as much as: gay men, not less. The following questions will help you to reflect and revise your answer:
3874	Gay women are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor. That is why I said gay women are more socially acceptable. That argument was obviously based on silliness as well as prejudice. gay women are more socially acceptable. That argument was obviously based on silliness as well as prejudice. I do not believe it or support it. However, I disagree with its premise. gay women are more socially acceptable. That argument was obviously based on silliness as well as prejudice. I do not believe it or support it.

3882	There is a new strategy game out now called The shortbow 4 I feel the graphics are missing something.... and the gameplay is all over the place lol. GRAW on the 360 is the best military multiplayer game on the system. The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic (being based in a much later future with more technological assumptions made). The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field to noobies alongside more experienced players. The interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. And GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.

COMMENT: The interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes to make it more intuitive, meaning you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. COMMENT: The replay value to me is actually stronger than that of the original. COMMENT: The character customization is more in-depth GRAW

3980	Raffles left Singapore for a few years and he led to farquer negleted us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS.
3981	Raffles left us to go study abroad but he was relatively not that bad and actually left us. It wasn't his fault he was a mess. Perhaps these things happen so that people know what he was like to those who loved him and their nostalgia may follow. He wasn't a fool.  He replied, "So, do you think Raffles was our father for real, considering the things you put his name forward are refuted by actual evidence. No matter how many times you talk about Raffles, not a peep. But you have your own list of what you think of Raffles. It goes beyond a gentleman. You may not like it if Raffles was also your father."

3983	Raffles left Singapore and farquier took over in charge. We did not neglect singapore. For that matter, even if Raffles had been alive, we would have still worked with a team of leaders to run this country. Raffles is not the only founding father we have here. We even have others now. Now your peronal comment about certain leaders is out the window.  Your arguments will need to be better argued if you want to move onto the next step of challenge competition.  No
3984	Raffles left Singapore because he was away for 2 years. Farquer was never in charge of anything. He worked very hard and did not neglect SST Ngee Ann Poly or NTU, but rather the two institutions took care of him and recognized his great achievements during his time away.  Be careful not to generalize. Many people have many lives! Raffles was an important leader who made many significant contributions in Singapore. He did leave for 2 years while the country was being re-built. You cannot compare him to any other leader. Please rewrite as follows: Raffles left Singapore for a few years because he was away rebuilding the country. He also left SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU in charge to work hard.

4030	 Hold it guys, I was talking to a student the other day about something stupid. None of this is really improving the quality of education.
4031	 Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their muscles and get thinner and more flexible instead of fatter and more lazy so they won't get bullied as much

4052	To realize on what they are capable of doing by working through the PE classes
4053	Because real PE lessons provide chances to people to realize on what they are capable of doing,so it will strengthen the self-esteem leading to them being productive in their society.
4054	 real PE lessons make students realize what they are capable of doing to improve their society.
4055	In order to fill the administrative position of Director-General, Raffles looked around for a suitable candidate. Unfortunately, Singapore still does not have someone as suitable to fill the position.
4056	Farquhar was originally the Minister of Commerce of Singapore. Raffles is the former Prime Minister of Singapore. Raffles changed their government and made Farquhar wrong.
4057	Raffles is right in the position that he is in. We should be able to make the argument that Raffles is placing a good match on the local population.  Raffles is right in the position that he is in. We should be able to make the argument that Raffles is placing a good match on the local population.
4058	Both Raffles and Farquhar were former colonial administrators. While Raffles was more concerned with maintaining the status quo, Farquhar fought for the betterment of the people and helped to develop Singapore's infrastructure. You may not agree with this statement. Because I view the position of former colonial administrators in a different way than you do. Raffles removed Farquhar.
4059	Raffles' actions were unjust, but I also think that Singapore has a poor policy of ' unemployment '. Raffles didn't remove Farquhar from his position in Singapore, he was removed from his position by the British government, and had other, unrelated reasons for his removal from office. But I do agree that Singapore has a poor policy on unemployment.  Raffles was unfair

4064	Tell your elected representatives that the choice should be given to you. Only if it would be reasonable for you to choose to abort, should she do so.    I think that the right to abortion is important, but the decision must come from me alone.

Well, if I have unanswered questions or feelings that i am unsure if they are appropriate, I can take an online class or sometimes contact the support service to ask them! Do what feels natural. I hope this guide helped ''
4109	 You have done this before and you didn't succeed. So let me give you a better perspective. One of the ways that you can help others is to make sure that your needs are met.
4110	 Although in education it might be good to expand yourself to help other people. I personally believe that these goals are better focused on my own interests. However education should never take over my true interests and desires. I should always keep them balanced. Personal pursue.
4111	 I personally will put more focus on myself & become more independent. I think that if I can help more people than look after myself I can not only reach my goal of becoming an assistant, but help even more families that need someone to look out for them as much as I do.
4112	 This argument now makes sense. However if I actually have to go for all my goals i may not be able to focus on them properly as I may not have the time to do everything and need to prioritize.

4115	...truth be told, this situation is about money. Before long the school district is running out of money to pay for all the drugs and frasier clothing it's been obligated to pay for. This is indicative of the outrageous charges they're asking for the kids to pay for shortchanging the rest of their lives.
4116	your school's, maybe a little. school district's responsibility. Why can't the schools act like FBI to make sure no one does drugs on school grounds? since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.
4117	The kid/youngster doesn't actually wear the clothing. They just say, "Hey, who said I can't wear whatever I want?" Won't stand in my way. On my own terms, yeah. Not on their terms, no. Nobody's tellin' me to. I can be who I wanna be. Kid
4118	To ask people to acknowledge when kids are using drugs or dressed like whores is paternalistic and a waste of their time. I wish you had pointed out that fact instead. That is the school dress code, as enacted by the school district, it's not up to the parents to interpret that on their own. It's often worse than the dress code at one's own private business.
4119	The school district obviously supports this pathetic cult of personality. It's embarrassing! You're correct school is the only place these kids go. And, more importantly they are the only places where you can learn about one other human being, it's about more than just the clothes they wear, school district should do it's best to create an environment that enables those kids to be true to themselves in their quest for knowledge and skill.
4120	 It makes the school more unified with better clean air and more student efficiency. Schools are better to learn if the students all have the same mentality about school uniforms. Simplicity is also useful, no problems to find nice clothes. Nowadays students don't know enough about the clothing, and have no idea.
4121	 That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i thought what was better to wear. It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
4122	 Oh, that looks really nice, I will go buy some later! Just do it! They put on their shirt and pants, they ready to go home. On their way they felt happier, as if they were in paradise. And it would be good to be here in summer vacation.
4123	As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
4124	that's a good idea. But the school should only have own uniforms for pupils. everyone should follow it. it looks good too. true, but there is no need for each pupil to have their own own outfit. it's already hard enough to choose a single outfit for you. it'll take hours for you to decide on what wear, just imagine the whole day!!
4125	 year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear . In the university....i spend too much time in choosing clothes. firstly, it is wasting a time. secondly, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups.

4131	A student in a school is equal to all others because he receives a great value in a school with uniformed , specially in developing countries . The rich students can afford new clothes that the poor students cannot , and they are more successful than without uniforms .
4132	The rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .

4134	Dress up for school in the uniform - it's fun and cheerful , and classes become easier . With uniform , we become even more relaxed and enjoyable . We don't even mind getting dirty - as long as we're clean , that is . Develop countries should adopt uniform , as it will make us happy .
4135	By 'dad' I mean that I'm proud of my kids, believe in them, and wanted their best interests in mind. You should consider all these arguments before sending me an email, because my email is about something else completely. Widow Wise
4136	If your kids learn how to dress in a decent manner, they'll be so much more capable of focusing their attention for 5 minutes. But if they can't focus in class, and end up distracting other students, that's NOT my fault.
4137	Maybe I'm stretching the limits. I'm tired of hearing from parents worried about their children learning and school work that I have been saying for the last 5 years, that discomfort with uniforms is nonexistent. Schools are not going to come and force me to put my uniforms on my kids.
4138	I understand your pain but your kids don't seem like they need this kind of punishment. Of course, I understand that a t-shirt is uncomfortable and not something you want for your kid, but good luck with that.
4139	 I agree with the letter. Children that are allowed to wear uniforms are often considered smart and focused children by their teachers. Here is the message: I agree that wearing a uniform while students should learn and work hard is very appropriate.
4140	We should encourage children to wear their school uniform. It reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school), it shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
4141	I believe that the wearing of the school uniform should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.  ### Bibliography: Fargan, M. A Guide to Writing Effective Arguments

4145	It is better to have a mother than to be motherless because she gives you so much love and safety. You'll never question if you're loved or not.  Fatherless
4146	I would choose fatherless. fatherless because no one is going to advise me about it. Ill be a complete idiot.
4147	A lousy father may sound like a lot better than not having a father, it is better to have a dad to push you to do better than it would have been otherwise.
4148	Don't be fatherless and take care of yourself, your family, and their family.  ### Output:  It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.   def must_h
4149	 F you father! To a fatherless person your father's the only one who really counts. You needn't say so, I know, but... You are in the right place
4150	 Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
4151	 I think my mom is lousy. Now, who's my dad? she thought his father was lousy and loved him for all the wrong reasons. It would suck to not have a dad. Because you're being raised by a parent, it's likely that that person is your dad. As a woman, it would be really hard for you to determine if it was your dad or your mom because all mom's are lousy. Not knowing if your dad exists will take pressure off your mom and help her out.
4152	I would rather have a bad father then never have a father at all. Having a bad father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can talk to him and make his do something he shouldn't and he'll get angry and say he should've stopped.  ### Phrase 1: I would rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all
4153	Moral of the story: You want a better father than a second parent. To know who your father is, have a second parent. There needs to be someone who you can talk to when you can't talk to your mother about. That person is a good father. You want a better father than a second parent.

I love my dad, I respect him as a father, and I appreciate his love for me beyond all measure. more, but I think my dad would never do it he loves me so much.
4156	I hate being fatherless. More like I hate not being loved by a dad. I'd rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food.
4157	I am being sarcastic. I love my dad and I don't know what I would do without him. I am being sarcastic. I love my dad and I don't know what I would do without him. Yes, he gets on my nerves sometimes. I am being sarcastic. I love my dad and I don't know what I would do without him. Yes, he gets on my nerves sometimes.

4159	To make an interesting cover, I need a back story about the father... as well as a bigger picture of the arguments between the father and mother. So I can talk about how family matters are a "underground currency" within these divide and conquer commandments. We will start with more detail about how the father felt about the plot.   # Define only after parenthetical content

4187	 The Finance Minister‚Äôs prediction of India growing at double digit rates by 2013 comes largely from the advantages India enjoys due to its more than 1.2 billion population, its recent demographic dividend, as well as some challenges, like poor education and infrastructure. The growth rate could also be sustained over the next few years.
4188	The demographics are indeed an important part of the current Indian growth story and play a huge role in India future economic growth.

4260	 I'm pro-life based on a major fact....there are many people out there who can't have children and would rather give their child up.  ### Reformulation:  I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If you can't protect yourself, get on the pill, give the baby up, just do it like millions of people do already.
4261	I'm pro life based on two major facts....... abortion being used the way it is today. like a last minute form of birth control. If your stupid enough to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.   I think these are the most important, but there are other important factors that are mentioned throughout the answer.
4262	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.

4265	 Because the possibility exists for the embryo to gain a human form regardless of how it starts, the baby needs to be given time to grow and develop with a minimum of complications or adversity to form an integrated body.
4266	 You will not have as much power over this child even if you love the child very much. However, you can be very close to them. Abortion does not make you stronger as a person, you lose the ability to protect a child. So, if the ability to protect a child from rape is disturbed (through abortion), we support rape
4267	A growing embryo is considered human because it has heartbeats. Furthermore, even if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Abortion on married women is rare because there is a reduced chance for unplanned pregnancies, and so it would be highly unlikely for a man to get out and kill someone unplanned.
4268	Your baby died when it was conceived. Sorta, it is possible to make such a loss. That is why we chose to perform a termination if the birth does not have a hope of being a living thing.
4269	Yes A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone? Yes
4270	 Question: What is the audience?
4271	Yes, children deserve the same right to life as they have that of their parents.  In this lesson:
4272	 I argue for the right to life of each child
4273	 Consider the crisis, its importance and the dangers
4274	 I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves to live just like the mother

4282	Having worked with gay men, I would say that AIDS prevention through gay marriage is a good idea.
4283	This is not a commonly known fact - Can you point me to a reference? Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem. #### No Comments
4284	 Yes, they do, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. However, they are not commonly known.
4285	 People shouldn't be so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
4286	Let's work on, the way that we treated others. We all live in the same world. I think that we all should work on it. I've also been around plenty of gay people and I think that they are really beautiful people with very strong opinions.
4287	People should stop being so against it. It's not bad to be gay. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
4288	People should stop being so against it. I know it feels weird. I understand it. It is just not right. It is okay to be gay, we are all humans.
4289	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
4290	A happy couple would be terrific. love and acceptance of gays is a great thing. people have the right to marry who they want to marry. i do not believe this argument is great but I stand by it. Thanks for helping me with this... False
4291	RomCom Fun 101: I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
4292	 Now I will tell you something about my friends. They are gay. I am gay. Both of my best friends are gay and they have the right to get married. I don't know about you but when I met my husband he was the best man ever. I met him before I met my best friends because he is my spouse, my husband.
4293	 Now my argument is that everyone has the right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
4294	 UNBELOW IS MORE MEANINGFUL MATERIAL: "Gay people do not get married for any purpose other than pleasure. Gay couples do not take children home to raise, not legally nor in any other way." "I am happy that my two gay best friends have been very loving to me and they both lived happily ever after."
4295	 Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish.
4296	 Targeted development is better in my opinion. How are you going to achieve common good if you cant develop your own technical ability. People may see that as being self absorbed but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.  Their own skills will become more applicable to the goal.
4297	 Although my opinion is personal, I will understand the common good by participating in my community.  I will achieve good will through the hardships of my personal pursuit. This argument emphasizes the need for people to work together. I think the first sentence is clear
4298	 Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself

4301	the being-fond-of-women should accept her sexual passion as a united hall with her partner over the centuries due to when they're as a couple. they love each other. people should accept passion as well instead of getting up to f**k their partners.
4302	 people ("pray" that) men will one day accept them as equals and in their own families as well pass on there and pass on. they did bad the politicians did anyhow.
4303	 males and females can be in civil unions with no consideration of religion, racial, sexual, or any other life style difference. this should be the standard practice. civil unions shouldn't have any death rating
4304	 They will never allow this, not in the church, not in the court, not in politics, and not in the courts. This is because many countries consider men with men is acceptable. However, if both men meet the minimum requirement, I believe they will allow this.
4305	no no no they do not. in fact the Patriot act has been very controversial since it was passed last year and only really comes into effect when the president believes the country is at a risk. with the Patriot act the government is able to do things like search without a warrant.
4306	no they do not. yes they do have more power than they advertise. since 9-11 the government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search vehicles, homes and businesses without a warrent which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution. no they do not.
4307	no they do not have more power than they advertise. As against the wording of the constitution the government has no right to a persons home without a warrant and to search cars, homes and businesses without a warrant.The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search       cars,homes and businesses without a warrent which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution.
4308	Yes they do have more power than they advertise. since 9-11 the government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch".

The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on law abiding citizens and the ability to search cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant, which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution.
4309	yeah maybe they do have more power than advertised but the government the intelligence agencies etc would need to be independent and stay that way otherwise its just going to turn into another way of stowing up money for the giants.   So if U.S. is more powerful than ever and global government threatens the United States' armed forces and public safety, yet U.S. is basically breaking the same laws that the global government broke, and new laws are passed more frequently, then what the U.S. could actually could be acting like the global government is leading us to do.

They are NOT my fault!!! hahaha^^  Rgb(255, 0, 0); print('Want me to give you a ticket now?'); print('I shall !'); print('The worst part of my job is ...'); print("The most dangerous part is when..."); print("I..."); print("have to drive through all..."); print("The idiots who don't pull over are usually ..."); print("On the phone so occupied to pay attention to their surroundings so they can't see the rest of the..."); print("Damned if they do, damned if they don't...."); print("You..."); print("can have a conversation in your..."); print("car with a passenger....."); print("Even thier hands are free...."); print("'Cause they can see what's..."); print("going on with traffic...."); print("And sometimes they can even point things out..."); print("for you driver...."); print('The person on the other end of the...'); print('Phone is just a distraction for the...'); print("driver")
4311	Yes, they should be arrested and fines probably will not be too great. it will be a little odd having someone around me driving recklessly, because I have this other job where I am on and off the road a lot (0900-1700)„ÄÇ The person on the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all. PS. Guess what is becoming the biggest excuse/cause for traffic accidents? Answer: I was on my cell phone and didn't see it coming.
4312	The punishment being too lenient. No, but there should definately be a huge fine!! I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  You'd be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away.  The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too occupied to pay attention to their surroundings.  Hands free phones don't help that much either.  You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.  The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.
4313	There should be a huge fine if they weren't paying attention, but shouldn't that person pull over and stop? NO. He should be arrested and have to pay a huge fine as a compensation to anyone who was injured, or worse, killed due to not pulling over. Thanks. So if there is someone on the other side of a phone, it is a great distraction for the driver. Yes. this is totally useless at helping the driver and can even have detrimental effects. No.

4316	 For the best insurance, you might consider getting some information from a psychic. When people call psychics, they are only looking to get some information and not get an accurate answer.
4317	 Waiting for the signal from God might just be useful depending on the situation. It is a method that I would not go so far as to commend, but the important question is whether you should wait for the signal.  ### Response:  Follow your heart; trust the process.
4318	 A psychic couldn't find her sister because she isn't there any more..lol? Just kidding...don't believe psychic stuff... But it wasn't his fault. Wouldn't be the first time he helped out an acquaintance, and was again helped out by that acquaintance back.

4320	 Oh, that's true. People need to be stopped before they hurt a child. Good to know. However, maybe we should stop in London instead of here. Because London has more gay people than here.
4321	 Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4322	 You should stop talking to these people and delete them. Just let the children be safe. Let them make their own choices and do their own thing. They should know better. Warning: Please delete these people from your life and never talk to them again. Who are these people and what do they do? You are talking to a paedo

4330	  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a direct translation for term 'gravid' that means 'pregnant' in English; that would be more like 'technically pregnant'.   So my translation here is that these words literally translate to 'Knowingly being pregnant' or 'knowingly becoming pregnant'. I think it's much less harmful to translate it as 'knowingly becoming pregnant'. I.e. when I remove a live embryonic embryo from it's mother, it is giving birth to a person's child. This child has the right to live at all costs.

4332	 They should consult with a specialist for a second opinion: Abortion is allowed only at the pregnant woman's request or with her consent from the third trimester of pregnancy. An early abortion is still considered an elective termination. The procedure of abortion during the third trimester of pregnancy is also known as induced abortion or abortion termination. If you've given the pregnancy to someone else by providing them with sperm, talk to them and have them do it if you're planning to get pregnant again. It's illegal to perform abortion for any reason other than rape or incest.

4334	 I see no problem with minors being able to get abortions, since the foetus has already developed enough to have an ability to stand up on its own, eat on its own, and a small brain to have moral and emotional feelings.     No matter what people say, human rights are universal, and any government in the world should protect them no matter who they are. Anti-choice people are and should always be stupid. If humans were always following their morals and disregarding the fact that there are many others who disagree with them, life would become very boring. That is why the rights of woman have been secured with the law.   The purpose of this skill: To teach teens and young adults about consent in relation to body image and the abortion procedure.
4335	  I will improve this dialog. I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist and I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which might be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment. I encountered bafflement. "Any particular disability?" I was asked. I have a son who has been disabled since the age of twelve. He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting. He has seen too much of people's attitudes
4336	 Parents are coming into their own as conscientious citizens and responsible workers because of the awareness of parental responsibilities stemming from the availability of workplace accommodations designed to assist people with specific disabilities. Parents also often feel responsible for the care of disabled children at home because they must get ready to work while providing care for their disabled children at home. Many modern jobs require less physical labor and require special training in areas such as computers and the ability to work with impaired sight or hearing.
4337	 Why are many children so insensitive? they are learning at home that lack of etiquette makes them soft-spoken and unmanly. they are to be pitied. they have not been socialized. they are to be condemned. they are not aware of society's attitudes towards disability. they must be grounded in kindness. they are not well socialized. they must be grounded in kindness.
4338	 Imagine being a 22-year-old deaf-mute who wants to become a newspaper reporter.   Below is how we might have submitted our critique to the author (without our names being attached to the email address):  your body of work is very good, however you still have a long way to go with the rhetorical and emotional barriers. Consider reading some of the books on deafmute experiences and writing about it. I guess this is the starting point.
4339	 I think it all starts earlier than one suspects. I am appalled at the way in which children use the term "spastic" as an insult.  What are they learning at home to be so insensitive?  It doesn't get better. I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist and I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which might be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment.

In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
4340	 These days maybe terrorists can talk like that, shoot first and ask questions later. Maybe? And anytime someone threatens to kill someone the government is going to go to extremes. It would be much better to get the police and provide them with a certain amount of ammunition and make sure they know how to use it. Yes, that would make the cops more effective. And maybe reduce them from doing their jobs much more like they are now doing. Yes
4341	People should be able to fire when they feel threatened with their lives. It makes complete sense. You tell me, is there a more effective weapon than firearms? I think there is not. Hope you like the new argument.
4342	Haywire in the street, one gun and no bullets shoot them and move on. It's that simple. And of course, getting a gun in this country requires a bit of a background check. Call me on my cell phone that has my number on it, and I'll meet you at the mall and show you the different kinds. Mrs. Zoo Goofy
4343	 This is terrible. Your right wing demons sure hang out in there, no wonder the cops are having a hard time. Since they can shoot you with impunity they really don't care if you're nuts. Oh well I guess it's always fine for some people to kill others as long as no one is killed. Please don't do this to anybody.
4344	 Someone bashed my door down and I want to shoot the shit out of someone. I would have never had this problem if I was the smartest person. And if this makes me look crazy, it makes me know that there are people that are stupid enough to think it is OK to take your life. If you get me I think I can help get you the cops. Maybe it is better to shoot on instinct. Maybe you can.
4345	The theory/structure/component is that the legal profession within the criminal justice system is very powerful in almost any country.   That is the body that makes the laws.  The people, as well as the police and the judges, can enforce the laws, but they themselves get what? what most certainly do not get is the money to get elected officials for who work their hardest for public welfare. large enough to effectively be vote bought out of all sorts of serials crimes against their own country and the general public and criminal byways as well, as the men of power have previously assured us, where the strict laws of the system will apply only to those with the pecuniary means to afford them
4346	Power and influence are ultimately decided by wealthy people who use their wealth to change policy. Everything, from the courts to the police, is on their turf. This is true of the police. Judges seem to play roles. Perhaps they do. However, they too serve powerful people with money. It is ultimately impossible to get these groups to truly listen to the people. Think about how easy it was to make rules that spelled the end for the people.
4347	     Law and Order is a syndicated US television crime drama and political satire, last aired in 2004 which follows the adventures of a division of the New York City Police Department's Violent Crime Task Force, tasked with solving high-profile homicides by high-powered organised crime bosses.

4348	  So these different types of policy roles are decided as interests get together and get money together to help get votes or influence the system in a group. You refer to "policy roles" as "playing policy roles". As in the series Law and Order it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession.  Part of the system is the law makers as well. There's a lot of politics and corruption in both criminal justice and policy making.

4350	This is quite the one - thank you for your comment.  Best of luck with your life. You really need to file a defamation of character lawsuit.  I doubt the police would do anything about this.  However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties.  You're better off letting it slide, taking the high road and living your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions.
4351	I have learned a hard lesson. I do not want the same situation to happen again. Although I am not bitter or mean hearted toward those who took it upon themselves to make any type of misrepresentations.

As a former bully in high school, this is something I've thought about a few times, and as someone who has a vulnerability to mental illness, would not be able to accept it after these events if the same experiences happened to me.

4359	You are afraid and most of the people you know might agree. When they get attacked in your own house, you hide behind these lists. Some say your list is not complete and you should update it. And when are they going to be finished updating these lists, when you die? What is it you are truly afraid of? The fact that the ppl in jail shouldn't be allowed to rape kids.
4360	Lawyers are wheeler-dealers who will push whatever they want, including intrusive questions, to cover up the truth and protect themselves. They use pushy tactics to undermine your confidence and discredit your statements unless of course the lawyer is defending or representing them. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by refusing to say anything until the lawyer asks a valid question.
4361	 Lawyers are the only species that walk without their front legs. They also get their cues from the environment. They pretend to care, but in reality, they are not. Warm Front Toothpaste Sabaoth The Dinosaur Rules! is a movie based on a true story.
4362	Lawyers are unethical employees that know their clients are vulnerable and likely to feel fearful. They will try to prey on you if you're a vulnerable person and will feel justified in breaking the law and exploiting you. Lawyers will pose all sorts of questions in an attempt to gain information about your life and contacts. They will also attempt to get you to give them favoritism by telling you stories. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is to not reveal too much and be secretive about who you really are and where you come from.
4363	Lawyers are lazy as snooks. They don't really do anything. They hold on to your money until the very end and spend months or years waiting for their windfall before they write you a check. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by charging the lawyer a fee from the beginning or taking the risk of holding up the income.

4365	 It always looks better in a lawyer's brief as opposed to what really happens. It looks better because people will think you're a lawyer or you are trying to make something about it. Regardless of what you tell yourself, legislation which makes criminals worse off is just stupid and criminal ignorance. It isn't something which is inherent in all or some crimes.
4366	No better reason we would agree...The second amendment rightfully protects us from terrorist attacks, domestic kidnappings, economic fluctuations, dictatorial states and people who take over other nations with guns in their hands. Yes...the concept behind it is good, but I do not believe that the american presidency needs to do so much. There are things we can and should do. The second amendment works great, and has tremendous powers in our hands. Happy hunting in the open...
4367	Please educate yourself about the issue, before any dumb-ish comments. Thats more like liberty destroyed with freedom. The second amendment was given to Americans so we could defend ourselves against the repression of arbitrary and unlawful threats coming from a mob of gun-wielding thugs. This is what happened the last time.   Thats liberal privilege more than that, the gun fetishists attempt to persuade us that the second amendment is that it is the right of gun owners to defend their own property and the lives of their families and the lives of neighbors from the lawless and law-abiding who dared to disturb the law-abiding and their friendships against the lawless. According to the second amendment the rights granted to us by our fathers, are secured against those who, under color of law, interfere with the same, and hope that no man should be deprived of his property, should not be compelled to expose
4368	 Crime rates will shoot up when there are none.    It is like saying there are fewer females in communities when the homes are empty. Safe areas will exist and crime will then be more difficult to do. Just ask NYC. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about here.  Violent crime, as has been demonstrated, is highly correlated to that mental illness. Ten per cent of the criminal population is paranoid schizophrenics, to the point that most of them don't even differentiate between right and wrong.   There is a direct correlation between mental illness and criminal behaviour.   No gun and no crime? When there is no gun crime is a description of the actual state of affairs. I am not advocating guns in any way shape or form, but it is a great question, and a dumb one at that!
4369	 THAT IS THE MOST TERRIBLE THING EVER. YOU INHERIT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO BE HOMESTEAD FOUNDERS THEY MAKE YOU INFECTED WITH ANTIAMERICAN INTOLERANCE.    The Mayors of law enforcement communities agree that the draconian laws cause more crime as well as victimized civilians who are constantly target of violent offenders.    Foreign visitors who are natives of it and are coming to America because they are simply unable to carry the threat of violence and brutality forward with them to their homeland. (You refuse to make the choice to defend your own homes and property when you have had it invaded by war mongers.)

Telling her what you can afford and that you are repaying the debt can bring comfort. Set a payment schedule. It's not over in the long run. Follow through. Know when to talk to her and if you will not have to remain in contact, she will know when you need to talk. I have no case, so do not let her go to legal action.
4392	Grandparents, versus grandchildren, we've got an interesting discussion going on here. Your intentions appear to be  - Your intention is to repay your grandchild to offset the loss that she gave you. It seems to be a fine compromise and, in my opinion, it would be best to just pay her back and let it go. No liability to her. There may be liability to her Dad. Yes, I agree that the loan is more serious when it comes from a grandchild, but you say you can't sue her, and I believe that's what this discussion is about.

You offered to pay the debt (for better or for worse), but, as you say, the same was true for her.  Since you both owe it to each other, you need to save your friendship regardless of whether you call it a loan or a gift.  You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain by speaking to her in a mature fashion and relying on wisdom rather than power.  She may not be able to repay all of it, but you can certainly offer some aid in the form of free toiletries or night supplies, to help out.

4395	No, I think this answer is fine. It is no surprise that increasing the adult sale limits to non-drinkable crops is bad for most people. It is also no surprise that it is bad for businesses. As most businesses make their sales via donations, cash and probably a part of it in a line to get the item rather than leaving goods to less numerous employees, unless they raise prices, they will find it very hard to survive. Drinking alcohol while at work will always be against company policy. However many view drug use as a choice that should be answered for in the civil courts, not the employment courts, in my opinion.    drug use is a choice that should be answered for in civil courts.
4396	Yes, because we are called to bear each other's burdens and support one another. also this will pay for all that is wrong with the world. - call to action - Now that would be government functions, people with power having different ways of changing the world. But since there is a population struggle we know that no one will ever win, but we can still support and love each other to somehow achieve these goals and change something. reading ALL responses be sure to act on this one!
4397	Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there. They can regulate it and tax the he11 out of it. Think of all the money the government would collect, not to mention how much they would save from the so called "war on drugs" (which they are losing).   Laws would be the same. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are.
4398	No it shouldn't be legal. Yes that makes a lot of sense. People are more violent when intoxicated. No, people shouldn't be allowed to fight other people like that unless they want to be jailed; Or like they can get into fights inside a football stadium. And if they fight each other, they probably shouldn't be fighting with real weapons, like swords. No, it doesn't make sense. No it doesn't make sense. Why is it more likely to be a crime to drive after drinking the first beer than the first joint. I don't think drinking one beer drunkens you as much as inhaling the smoke from a joint. And it doesn't have to be tolerated. The legal limit is 5 drinks, five days a week. People shouldn't be able to fIight other people before they are high enough to know what they're doing. People shouldn't be selling drugs to children. No.
4399	Yes, people are foolish to consume drugs, but they make no sense to punish them for doing so. They are already being punished for other serious crimes they make - yes - it's stupid to close prisons for that. Plus, the thing is that when these people learn how to do other serious crimes while in prison (money spinning, theft, extortion, etc), it's a big plus to the economy. So it's more than likely they would continue to try the drugs and get a break from jail. What is going on, that "war on drugs" just isn't working? Don't you think? Why would anyone get into trouble for getting high on a joint?
4400	Yes, they will notify you that you are under arrest. They can also confirm, that you have not yet been charged. They will also ensure that you have a seat belt/brake time available if you get pulled over.
4401	You will receive a warrant, I'm sure, and the local law enforcement officer will want you to pay the fine and exhibit it upon arrest. If not, the warrant will be ignored for the next time and you can be arrested for an outstanding warrant.

4410	 The response, I believe, is that prevention is better than cure.  Now the argument can stand on it's own and does not need modification at all. Psychologists and psychiatrists have no substantial capacity to modify the bad behavior of criminals. They can help to treat criminals by helping their behavior to improve.

4413	 This field allows you to bring up bad behaviors in a not-so-wholesome family/environment. make only minimal changes to the original argument. In my own opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons.
4414	 Some prisons keep criminals locked up and forbidden to contact anybody for about 3-4 years. I think this is a bad idea because they are being punished for something they did many years ago. Besides, I think it is best to keep them with the family/environment. We should never isolate them.
4415	The election would have to be in six months or less from now. And no one would be permitted to run for office two times. Possibly seven years after reaching 80, the person would be eligible to run for office again. What do you think? House members serving longer than two terms in office should be prevented from being candidates in the next election. No candidate over the age of 80 should be allowed to run in the election in six months. The main idea would be these specific points.

4420	After reading the news about this I think that you should be more careful about tossing things out the window. If you are really upset about this then take your case to court, even though you will probably lose. At times if you leave a cigarette in a car it becomes dangerous. Now you have to think, what do I have to do to get rid of a cigarette? Weigh the alternative options.
4421	 Sorry for that, I would really appreciate it if you didn't take my car! My bad. You've also been warned. It was not a pretty situation as I lost my cool and tossed the cigarette out of my window. Unfortunately, it was over the windshield. Again, the number of reasons the smoking was a big issue was not looked into during the check. I do not know what the officer at the time thought it was.  I threw it out of the window because I was upset.
4422	Detectives would do a better job of identification but the only reason they might call the officer is if they were dealing with more serious problems.  Their work is not limited to simply identify people, they also attempt to seize items, arrest those who are committing crimes, and keep the streets safe. Look into legal representation and don't feel bad. best for the one who tosses the butt out of the window, who it won't make it through the window.
4423	Is anyone else driving on the road with you? Why are you getting a ticket? Only the driver needs to file a complaint with the Department of Transportation if they think that they have been unfairly targeted or discriminated against in some way. Otherwise, they're only required to file a complaint with the local police. Unfortunately there is little to nothing you can do about it. Fortunately, the Internet allows you to create your own virtual DMV.
4424	I'm not sure what you would call someone who throws a butt out of their window. I personally wouldn't. In rural areas they aren't illegal, however it can be more trouble than its worth. Here are some things to keep in mind if you get caught:  #1. Think of what other things are out there to do with your spare time, a potential tow, and why you would want to do such an evil and poor thing. #3. Now think of who was driving and if there was another vehicle on the road that may have hit the window. #6. You need to rethink how this situation played out and try to see if something in his line of thinking may have happened.

It would be good to receive free samples of any of the products I'd like to try. The last two sentences of the original argument were removed for simplicity.
4432	add in more publicity and direct support for the wrongdoer If a businessman is defrauding you, you can report to the Better Business Bureau. If you suspect the corporate entity is defrauding you, contact the regulator. We call the regulator government, because it's usually a government office.
4433	 Print the first line, then print the new line: Second line. Big deal! You want to tell him that and then send it all his way. Now that you've added a more appropriate response, print the second line (exhale) of your paper, which is not done at all in the present example.
4434	ok, I know, sorry, that whole joke was a little misplaced. Make sure to call the better business bureau in your area before you sue if you have grounds for a complaint. Contact the car dealership group in your area for tips if you see signs of odd behavior. Contact the TV station if your behavior is getting out of hand and they are having problems.
4435	 Legal advice is worth it, it won t cost u p m c u . What if your lose everything. Why should they care. If they get the law and are not paid. They better take action. It would sad that u were forced to quit. Confide in a lawyer who has clients like u.
4436	 Seek legal advice. I mean if your gonna lose your job anyway and maybe you own for lack of money. What have you got to lose? Your kids could starve you could lose everything you own. Do something before that happens. They company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!!!!  Most of them couldn't care less about their people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. Seen it to many times. Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
4437	See a doctor. Seems reasonable. If you are injured at work, you will get a workman's comp check or lump sum payment. None of the above choices. Your title should not be in bold. It is not a sentence. I rewrote the response of the person who asked for advice, but I did not change anything of the content.

4441	I am surprised. How does your friend see this situation? The caretaker behind bars is making a good income by keeping prisoners in fear of police. Some prisoners are willing to threaten the caretaker. Some even kill.
4442	 Prison is nothing more than a tool of a criminal organization that is run by criminals inside. There are better places to lay down to rest such as a cemetery. He may be found in a cemetery or a spot that allows one to bury oneself.
4443	As I have said, prison is no deterrent to crime. So this would all be probably prevented if the inmates could do nothing but read books to live instead of running around as children do.
4444	While it is understandable if their laws are strict and criminalizing, prison inmates would not have to obey those rules to steal. You might think since people die when they break the rules that prison is a deterrent, but the prisoners in those prisons seem so comfortable with breaking the rules that it does not appear that prison is in the least a deterrent to their crime.
4445	 And to my sister i would just say to talk to her parents as much as you can and not get someone else to kill them while you take care of your siblings...kill them while youre at it take your brothers and sisters from their mothers and put them in the cold because youve done it 1000 times so its no big deal to you but seriously do it slowly and not to often because u are weak...
4446	should look into divorce lawyer right now...i think they are the last ones that would recommend her to try to do it...go to a family court so they dont have to discipline her... if she really cares about her kids she could get a court order to get her kids in spite of what her hubby says. look into all options my dear.....
4447	She was distraught when her mom took her kids. Try to talk to her. You might not know the true reason but she might like to have kids. You can talk to her about her mom. She just has to make sure she doesn't suffer financially in the process. Mom doesn't love kids anymore, they're all the responsibilities. You can save money for her in a separate account.
4448	be patient with your sister.  Dear Aunty: First of all, I want to apologize that my daughter did not like you. However, you know my daughter hates to be disobeyed but, the moment we have to change our domestic arrangements, she has to go with us. In my opinion, they did not do wrong at all and they worked hard enough. I do not believe that they need an overnight job to pay for the whole round trip to their home. Secondly, I would like to ask you whether it is necessary to save for old age. You know that my daughter only worked as a stewardess for a few years and is still young. I know that you are my aunt and that you are concerned about my daughter, but if she could do something different in her life she could have saved her part of the money instead of doing half-time job and taking the kids to the ocean together. I know that your own daughter worked full-time at a big supermarket, but that was quite different
4449	 If the mother wants her children back, she may be able to get them back. However, it is also possible that she really does not want to return. At any rate, do not interfere with your sister‚Äôs decision. Your sister‚Äôs sister may feel the same way. Your sister‚Äôs sister may be supportive. Be courteous and discreet.

This is particularly true for the large companies and governments. For the privacy of individuals and the duties of judges, the power must be shared. It is funny how you also draw an unreasonable conclusion from nothing, and now apply it to everything. Repeatedly changing the wording does not fix the problem.
4453	The over-riding concern in my proposed course of action should be the following:  **** further continue to unleash violence ****... use COIN to unleash massive violence on who knows who, for what does not say (CEO coin provides the foundation for SW-Claw, which is possible upon a trusted relationship with another CEO coin, symbolizing a sealed writing on paper)
4454	Falsehoods like that about Federal agencies abridging civil liberties ... have been nearly demolished in courts and at least seven nationally recognized laws have been passed which require new access to many kinds of such evidence to be examined under certain rigorous conditions for fairness. That is not the only way in which civil liberties have been diminished. Please be more specific.

4456	 Re: Hi! Can't you do that as gay instead of firing people for being gay? You know it's nothing personal, its just part of the job. Funny you mention that as one of the problem with me being gay... Factually as is.

4466	Yes, you can be emancipated even if you're pregnant, but most people aren't going to question you about it. It also provides a fairly obvious reason to get it passed. Generally it's easier than you're thinking. It took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. And, of course, it definitely reduces the burden on your parents.
4467	Yes, they did it! Why? Because they needed to. When the child was very young, they did it and it was really easy. Because they were there as often as possible and watched the kid. Because they were set up to deal with it, from the start.
4468	Yes. you should make this request if you're emancipated by marriage. specify the make clear that you're emancipating the child to date. you will need to perform the same duties/responsibilities toward the child as if you were still married. To do so, your spouse must be listed on the emancipated child‚Äôs birth certificate.
4469	Yes.The emancipation was fine, and I felt really safe now. No note.I also really recommend it, just as long as you have a good lawyer on your side. No note.Yes.I wish people would realize the benefits of emancipation more before they go through with it, because even having your own BIL didn't work for me. Yes.I am relieved that I wasn't forced to stay and take care of an abandoned teenager.
4470	The person/family should be let walk out of here on their own terms. The person being sentenced should not be forced into having any medical care while in jail as long as that choice remains. That can only be up to them, not the government, don't you think?
4471	They should be tortured.....when they castrate them they should do it without giving them pain medication. I don't think it's fair when people get the death penalty all that they "suffer" is a little injection by a lethal shot! When they die they have no worries and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars!! The person/family they commited the crime against usually is tortured and suffereing for the rest of their lives! It should be "eye for eye tooth for tooth"

4480	 My view is that it shouldn't be illegal to self medicate, with proper monitoring. More problematically, even though it should be illegal to "kill" yourself in the first place, let's say you use drugs that make you feel better and go on happily living your life in prison. The moral difference is so much, there is no reason to even compare them. My view is that if you're constantly in pain and suffering for years or if you feel totally depressed, that ending your life shouldn't be the last resort.
4481	 No one has the right to take our lives unless we ourselves decide to do so. I'm still for self-euthanasia if someone else doesn't take our lives in the first place. So I've decided that it is appropriate to make a conscious decision on how to end my own life, within the moral framework in which I believe, either by asking someone else to end it for me, or by ending it myself. other, helping it to end (without causing death)
4482	 I feel sad, but I don't believe my family is deserving to die because my father is in prison for a crime I did not commit. I feel sorry for them. Reminds me of a quote from Kierkegaard (which is what I'm originally from, to clarify): "Everyone has the right to die. The only proper question is:  How?" Finally, while I understand that there are patients who have legitimate health concerns, the lack of access to the care they need should not constitute a punishment for their condition.
4483	My life is my life, and I am completely in control over it and it would be ridiculous to not believe that my life is more important that anything in the world. Your life is your life, and you have no choice if you want to live longer with this kind of state, it is your choice to choose to live.    I believe this is an interesting and important topic. Some people do not want to suffer and make their own choices because they are mad!
4484	 The death of one person is the death of one person, this is the same for everyone.  When death is inevitable it is acceptable to die peacefully. my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons. And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending her life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating.

4487	Since we have concluded that we are exposed to sensory input from everyday life, the only ways this input could affect our body is through food. The body requires oxygen to digest the food that we ingest from everyday life. The body produces an enzyme to break down the food into something that the body can make oxygen from. The body requires oxygen to make the enzymes. The body consumes the enzymes. It turns the food into chemicals that produce more energy. The body produces fat to store this energy for later use. Otherwise, we would be starving within the first couple of days.

4490	They don't clean properly and mess things up later. For the dishes already messy, handwashing is not possible. They are a load of waste of money. Dishwashers are overrated, undercapable, and overpriced appliances that have no place in a modern kitchen. The dishwasher is overrated, under-capable, and over-priced. The right dishwasher can take your dirty dishes and leave them clean as new, and you can spend less time cleaning and more time living.
4491	- add "1 hour" to the "number of minutes" of the mandatory prewash cycle, and also remove "with a cold water rinse" from the end of the sentence. For example, now all detergent and cleaning products should be removed before the dishwasher goes in the washing phase. - add "1 hour" to the "number of minutes" of the mandatory prewash cycle, and also remove "with a cold water rinse" from the end of the sentence. For example, now all detergent and cleaning products should be removed before the dishwasher goes in the washing phase. - make a strong argument against excessive use of dishwashers
4492	- dishes left in dishwashers to dry contribute to the mess the dishwasher makes next time you run the machine. - sometimes dishwashers will not be able to fully clean certain items such as cups, glass, baby bottles and some other particularly small items unless you take these out before you run the dishwasher.  - this idea originated with me by word of mouth from friends and family when I repeatedly received extensive dishwashers feedback complaining about their expensive, ineffective, overpriced machines and the lack of options for doing a more thorough clean. - dishwashers are rather inefficient in cleaning certain areas. Certain areas of the dishwasher (particularly for large dishes) aren't always effectively cleaned and the rest of the dirty dishes are left to dry in the same mess.
4493	My reasoning is simple:  - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre cleaned". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities? - dishwashers rarely removed ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually. - dishwashers don't properly dry "deep" items like Tupperware and pots, if you aren't careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless. - for above reasons  I don't recommend dishwashers
4494	- The dishwasher needs a better prep period - You should use a dishwasher if your dish dishes are in a spotless state when you have to empty them. If you leave things sticky, greasy, dusty or piled high, chances are you will not be able to use the dishwasher. If you must scrub, rinse, and rinse again, then you will not have a clean dishwasher and you will be unwittingly screwing up the dishwasher's capabilities and damaging its seals with your dirty dishes. - Dishwashers do not properly clean deep items - If an item such as a Tupperware container was deep enough to fit within the dishwasher, the damp water would not reach the bottom of the container, yet the slow-motion action of the rotation would rattle the contents of the container out. Since the dishwasher is too slow for Tupperware (a deep item), you would have to manually handle these items when you clean dishes.
4495	 To me, the idea that white people have better lives than minorities is nothing less than white privilege. That's about it. Explore more about why white privilege should be removed from our culture. Recognize the effects white privilege has on the black community. Recruit others to join us as we work to remove white privilege from our world. We are rallying people together to educate and improve our community through education.
4496	 As someone who is a white man, I am guilty of being white privileged and that's why I'm sensitive to any racism in my community. I feel  guilt when I hear about racism in my community because I know that I need to do my best to end racism in my community. However I don't think of myself as being a victim of racism.   # note that the verb is plural, not singular
4497	 white privilege I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grew up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.
4498	 Easy things are not white privilege. When you see whites as slow, lazy, heartless, and low IQ, I don't see it as privilege at all. Like I said, I did that to best. Not all whites are like that, but a lot of them are. That's ok. People have different tastes and opinions, but to me that is no reason to discriminate. What is wrong with the phrase, "I could easily use a black female engineer right now"? If you're a black woman engineer, just sayin'? Is that sarcasm? No
4499	 Why white privilege exists: it is misplaced and wrong  white privilege are in a disadvantaged position, white people gain, unlike a minorities, in a position of power. This has happened, because of misplaced white privilege And here, there is a fact   white people are good racists, because they don't think that hate discriminate against, black people are. minorities do
4500	The invasion of iraq is justified because it is a terrorist war for oil to the planed for a regime change in iraq, thousands died in the invasion in the hope of handing power to someone they want now and overthrowing an established government. Iraq had a strong economy with a strong industry and anti war protesters demonstrated peacefully every day until they were brutally killed by the government.
4501	 Gaza is occupied by Israel with barely a smother rate of life to shut down the shelling and the military boarding battalions in helicopters following teams of troops ship follow by calm observer teams of Israel security forces with flags you couldn‚Äôt write sharia rules here without threatening people long term. And in many cases my dear israeli those troops write the rules and daily assess Palestinian lives. The invasion can be consider as a global war in which u will just say please sir pay me for my equipment and my kill time!! Israel occupies gaza for many years and coddles and bribes palestinians to subicate and for better earth and heavily defends u idea of palestinians assaulting u territory. But rest assured israeli we arnt done yet, we are not making any truce with hamas and will definitely follow israel through until its full stop in gaza israel occupies gaza and expects you to make more sacrifices.
4502	15yr old boy: no, he has no blood on him 14yr old boy: no, he is an israeli boy 8yr old boy: no, he is a boy without hat brigit: no, he is an israeli boy no, he is a palestinian boy maybe even a suicide bomber mother: no, he is an israeli boy boy: he is a palestinian boy
4503	Its the same as iraq, you dont stop terrorism by coming in and fucking peoples lives up, palestinians already hate israel and terrorising gaza only radicalises people and turns them into hamas militants. #"And the invasion of gaza is unjustified as well as impractical." ### Answer: Compared to ipl it‚Äôs the same as syria - you dont stop terrorism by coming in and fucking peoples lives up, syrians already hate israel and terrorising syria only radicalises people and turns them into syrian terrorists.
4504	You can increase punishing gaza terrorists to make it more gleeful to gaza residents. Make gaza more of an incubator to terrorist activities and gaza will become more radicalised.  Make it a trap to harbour terrorists so terrorists get caught in the crossfire and get killed. This way you will have covert, peaceable tactics for less war.
4505	  Obey laws, treat others according to their treatment of you! What does this have to do with the fact you're going to get amnesty? time to set a tone here.  It is fact that you should respect the laws and be fair towards other residents of the US, and if you break the laws and do not treat others according to their treatment of you, it is never the right of the US to request your citizenship!  How is your behavior not governed by the law? If you didn't get free citizenship in your home country, where did you come from? the laws that you don't respect and exploit other citizens who are worse off, and put them in more dire situations then you, then there are reasons to do nothing.  You are the first person I know to call for people to do something illegal.
4506	The term government itself is not the issue here. The real issue is, what constitutes a government. If government is simply a legal fiction,  we can place the burden on someone else. So far however, those who are calling for amnesty have failed to provide any rational arguments to back their statement. They are just plain stupid. I urge you to stop this charade and order yourself into a reasonable debate about what should be done with illegal immigrants. You have been allowed to duplicate and plagiarize my thesis and defense, and you will never regain my respect.
4507	Along the same line, here are the responses we would expect to see if one of the above arguments were thrown up against one of the Deplorable, not amnesty proponents. On Friday, President Obama signed an executive order to deport non-citizens. Obama's order was part of his immigration overhaul plans that were approved last year by lawmakers. Some critics say he wants an excuse to make this move a pretext for forcefully seizing one million non-citizens for use in the labor force. Below are some comments: The threat, which can kick in with as little as a day's notice, could in theory deprive a U.S. immigrants of their parents, children, spouses, siblings and two grandparents.
4508	Halting of immigration by granting amnesty  requires an understanding of the political dilemma in which the American public finds itself. It would lead to the very loss of the border to Mexico.  For that reason, amnesty would not be acceptable. This is how I'm going to continue my argument...  insanity on the border? What else would you expect from republicans who are incapable of reasoning? and their reluctance to get immigration reform. And forget about comprehensive immigration reform. They can‚Äôt even do the regular, jaundiced version. They‚Äôve already rejected even the modest version in the past.
4509	(Others have pointed out above) that amnesty supporters argue in terms of employment. Some of the stupidest and most ridiculous comments are as follows: "We would employ the immigrants and because of their presence in America they would pay taxes and also consititute a vote for this country." It makes no sense to me that the gov t would like to work with these people. However a resounding majority of Americans have told the gov t to back off.  upgrade (I love it) @ gmist/ 68.10 It's funny here we have the amnesty supporters who spend years praising terrorists, and when asked of why they are in favor of lax immigration, they don't have a clue and make the asinine claim that the terrorists come from immigrants and of course terrorizing the innocent U.S.Makes no sense to me at all, for according to the so called "final reports" by a counter-terrorist group set up by the government calling itself the AWB for the unofficial U.S. government... more on that),
4510	 Soda industry 's supports are highly questionable and don't stand the burden of proof. they simply don't have the sense or the intelligence to be able to craft a rational argument against the use of a product. its obviously an attempt at political correctness for the government to push soda tax enactments that just beg to question their worth and credibility. don't waste your money, your time, or  your breath on a soda tax argument that is not credible .
4511	 populations are constantly learning new ways to resist the onslaught of governmental propaganda &    ### response: ## governments and health organizations can and will be persuaded to change their propaganda and laws when evidence is presented to them showing that the laws and regulations created by such belief actually backfire. It's not enough to just think they can make money from you using "demographic displacement". They depend on continuing to push their agenda without evidence to back it up!
4512	    let soda_price = 3.5  let gov_cost = 12.5 - soda_price // dollars per person  println("Make sure governments are not only greedy but also not smart.")  println("The government will spend $[" + gov_cost + "] on excess taxes on each person.") // per person. makes the comparison to cigarettes even more shameful. its about money today not public health.

4514	 I won't change my opinion, since there is no reasoning in the argument. The government is not just greedy. I've been around and studied it. Their propaganda is more convincing than the reality. I'm a professor and health psychologist. the government's greed in trying to control the body weight of citizens does not support their argument that soda taxes will prevent obesity. the body fat percentage of most americans has increased over the last 15 years. the government controls consumer spending through inflation. they also pass legislation that restricts exercise through automobile accidents and driving bans. recent study suggest tobacco and alcohol and tobacco's effect is more on the health than soda is. the government is treating their citizens like criminals. when the government takes away freedoms why shouldn't the government take away the prerogative of buying sodas and alcohol
4515	What I wrote: The only two scenes that were interesting at all were the ouija board scene and the ending. The rest was just people sleeping with the occasional noise. I can appreciate a slow build (I loved The Blair Witch Project) but Paranormal Activity was just boring to me. I doubt my opinion will be changed, but I just want to know why anyone liked it. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but it is beyond me how anyone could think that film was entertaining or artistically noteworthy. Also, please do  not use the sequels to defend the quality of the first film. I want to understand why the first film was so acclaimed even before any sequels were released.
4516	1 paragraph  With the exception of the scenes I had mentioned, most of the film was extremely predictable. I saw many scenes that I had seen in PG-13 comedies, much more violent and disturbing.  I enjoyed a few scenes, but not the first hour and a half. I was bored. I was extremely exhausted and did not want to be sat there for so long while people slept.   Also, the acting was poor, especially for adult roles. The dialogue was awkward and abrupt.  I feel that the writing was fragmented and disjointed. The plot was meandering and unoriginal. Paranormal Activity I did not like and would never recommend.
4517	Understanding has been increased. I could understand why the movie was noteworthy without being artful. While the protagonist saw or thought he saw an entity, there was nothing else and no control of it. The supernatural aspect was just there to appease the viewer. Paranormal Activity's monsters were made for the people, they were a way for the superstitious, fixated followers of Paranormal Activity to believe that they had interaction with the supernatural. Paranormal Activity is a paranormal movie aimed at people who do not appreciate art or innovative films.
4518	bad characters, bad direction, bad acting, and bad storytelling, and poor dialogue. also feels that most negative reviews have gone out of the usual terrified child millennial slant and skew it too much, which was a problem with Paranormal Activity as well child millennial, they really can be over extreme and may as well watched a 90 minute concert of nonsensical horror waves
4519	there were few interesting scenes in the movie and these scenes showed that the characters were asleep at most points. now there were a few answers the film seems similar to the late blair witch project but not as good as that movie. Few things are difficult to live up to their predecessor in most movies but any respectable fan would love to tell you how long they think the original movie was better at.
4520	 @A10 That's debatable. Psychedelics may be more useful than harmful. I think all kinds of substances should be legalized as long as they do not have any use to anybody. Freedom for the masses. Psychedelic drug use may be very beneficial. However, it would be illogical to define them as drugs. That would diminish their usefulness as mental sustenances. I believe psychedelics such as Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc are useful resources in psychotherapy and that research should continue into their use.
4521	 Science doesn't support the use of psychedelics. Psychedelics are not proven to have mental/physical benefits that alcohol and tobacco have. Therefore psychedelic should not be legalized for use. Point well taken.üëç the absence of evidence is not proof of the absence of effectYou should consider about a potential benefit of psilocbin stating:  ### Response:  Psychedelics can have mental/physical benefits to a person. However, it is still not proven that they are beneficial, since there are proven side-effects.
4522	 Yes, people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it's not harmful to anyone else. Psilocybin or LSD should not be legalized, with special note to what may be done with nBOMe's. I don't think Psychedelics are addictive. People may use them to improve their quality of life and that's all they should be used for. of using substances such as nBOMe. People may use them to improve their
4523	 smoking legalized cigarettes, don't be mad. Just be careful with what you smoke. psychedelics should be legalized. People should not be made unable to have reasons to research those that could be beneficial to them in terms of drinking. that drug that works wonders on people's lives who also is less harmful than many of the mainstream drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. legally allow it to exist, and create laws that govern it properly. illicit drugs should be illegal, not for moral reasons but because psychedelic don't tend to become addictive, so the government's responsibility is not to keep people from using them but to keep them from becoming addicted to them and being able to harm themselves or others.
4524	 If psychedelics are merely harmless and non-addictive I don't see why they should be illegal. People should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public and such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as psilocybin and lsd are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, especially compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.
4525	  3 million people in the US is 0.1% of the US population. According to http://www.who.int/diabetes/aboutdiabetes/en/ it is estimated that there are 10 million Type 1 diabetics in the US. so 0.1% is 3 million. even 0.1% is a significant amount of people to consider. but also take into the fact that more people are going to develop it with the vast population of the US.

4535	There is no set number of minutes in a day, week or month where a man or woman is free to do absolutely whatever she wants. There is always an 'iron curtain' over us which keeps us from being free for a single moment. Therefore, free for the amount of time we want to do the things we want to do would, of course, be a better option. It would certainly solve your question.
4536	It would create the illusion of legality and would then provide access to dangerous drugs and make prostitution even more dangerous. It will make our lives much safer if we can control our own actions in life, rather than depending on "unfair" laws, or government action to control it. if prostitution is a decision between adults, isn't it better to let a prostitute choose how to earn her own money, rather than its the government deciding?
4537	 In most places, prostitution is a crime to prostitutes, but often no real threat to clients. Proportionate rights is accurate. Also, in most countries, legality of prostitution, regulation, and taxation are separate issues. According to my opinion, prostitution should be legalized.
4538	These new sub-competences are flexible but particular elements remain identical to the original sub-competences. Clients can support prostitutes financially, treat them politely, and require care, respectability and protection for their investment.

Catholic, it would be unforgiveable for Catholic theology to allow for the abuses that take place around us to continue unchecked. prostitutes are not free, they are in this together with their clients.

That's an accepted answer, historical works such as titles or people, Key terms or keywords etc. Search for nothing. If the person asking knew that they were asking something without having researched it before, then they didn't ask the question. Otherwise, they are lying by saying they didn't know. This doesn't have anything to do with the core premise of the question; it was just an example of how it could be manipulated.
4542	Why would there be no hard to way? I would say the search function can help because the only thing you have to do is write a keyword and hit the search button. if anyone does want to know they can figure it out. they only need the ability to have read the previous post to get an answer to know the previous post. If not they will just have to form the question. YES. Basically no ifs ands or buts. You're talking about current posts that have been made and not old ones. No, because they don't have to read all the previous posts and you are basically making it a sin to ask older posts.

4544	I see this as positive. I think people should be able to ask questions they want to ask even if that question was asked before.

4545	This particular argument--in the context of a public roadway or other open area--is obviously incorrect and will be incorrectly edited. remove vehicles from their their owners' grounds --when there is question of how the owners will get the required payment for those vehicles--is theft and should be illegal. To make a private towing company an officially sanctioned tow company, it must have the lawful authority of the town in whose business area it is a part of. (key-word: tow a vehicle belongs to)
4546	Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on thier behalf--and the towing company holding the vehicle for ~~payment~~ ransom--is tantamount to theft and should be illegal. The only justification for a tow company to remove a vehicle from the owners property is that the police are involved. This can only occur if the owner has a permit from the police department to remove the vehicle.
4547	Action to taken after the vehicle has been impounded at the police impound lot: To be returned to the owner who had it impounded. Thus in effect I am urging people to call for the impound lot, and have a tow company take it away. we must become an impound lot and impound cars for the county.
4548	Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on thier behalf--and the towing company holding the vehicle for ~~payment~~ ransom--is tantamount to theft and should be illegal.  I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a *police* impound lot.

4550	I've read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be studied ?   People of different origins have different bodies (skeletton, skin color...) why wouldn't they have a different brain ? On the other hand I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
4551	 Instead, if we want evidence that certain races are superior, shouldn't we stick to studies that look at how these races are taught ? Why some races are better than others  is caused by racism and not by true abilities to reason, but it can be studied in a way that will not get missed.   ### Next:  Should we stick to studying how people are taught to be better than others, instead of trying to understand the true differences between races?
4552	 People of different origins have different bodies (skeletton, skin color...) why wouldn't they have a different brain ? Just like the differences between gender doesn't make one superior to another. Someone should study these differences so they can best understand their race and learn about their own culture
4553	 I support the fact that the different races should be studied but I don't agree that they are superior to others.  In my opinion we should be focusing our research efforts on the darkest races and bestow the most beneficial treatments. Since the different races have different capabilities, we should do the research on how to best assist rather than judge or unnecessarily focus our research efforts on certain racial categories.
4554	I wish that racism was abolished. I don't think people should be studying how the brains of different races are different for reasons already mentioned. However, you should consider its state of the current study. Hey, if there's a resurgence, that could happen. I personally think that racism is very bad.

He's a better man than Indiana Jones.

So our species was quickly wiped off the face of the earth in nature's inevitable reaction to our actions. They used Wikipedia as a tool to come up with an explanation on how we got where we are. Our species was used as an experiment, but instead of coming up with potentially dangerous technology, aliens would have an alternate to the experiment. The aliens may have some advanced technology for depleting natural resources from the earth and using other resources for us.

4570	  * Software is important to the mankind, in the sense that without software, there would be very few applications that would have arisen. No company has a right to prevent there being a software that is useful and efficient. For example, many cars were patented before many cars had been invented. Many cars are today patented, and one day there will be a completely different car, without its intellectual property. The American people were left behind by that time. However, the patent process requires a ton of paperwork and bureaucracy and on top of that costs about $100 per claim. In the long run, the patent system is bad for everyone involved.
4571	I am a software engineer working for major software companies who devote thousands of man-hours to develop outstanding custom software for end user businesses. I sincerely regretfully say that it will always have an edge for those who make money off of software patents. It just makes buying software more expensive. When a new technology emerges, data compression is used to copy programs from computers to paper. text compression is used for pasted emails, encrypted devices, voice software is used to record secret dialogs, and so on.
4572	 I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.  Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted) this includes software algorithims * Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards) Artificial Intelligent may also be patentable if it has a purpose of being able to violate patents. Most semiconductor patents are incredibly stupid and fall right out of being patentable once their "challenging potential" is exposed as nonsense. software algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc etc)) the only thing that should be protectable is the final product. It doesnt give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright not patent.

4576	This topic is not about evolution, yes, that's great. This topic is about evolution. The opposite of evolution is not static. It changes, in the same way our bodies change. Every person who ever made a baby wanted to make babies that would be the best they're capable of being. Our bodies aren't designed to have 50 million pages of political philosophy to read, so let's get this straight.
4577	 I'm not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in THEORY, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.

4579	But a single employee can't make it for himself if the company doesn't invest and want to thrive. It has been proven in countless cases that the worker isn't contributing enough to fund the proper lifestyles for them and they get nothing other than low incomes, and must rely on borrowing from the banking system for a living in order to keep up with the Joneses. Plus, why would the worker really care?

4585	 You have too much power to suggest things like that, it is up to every single person in his or her home to not to smoke but to keep a designated spot for each room in the house to a minimum and stop smoking there and find an alternative to smoke inside that is safe and doesn‚Äôt have much negative effects.
4586	There is much more to it than just concern for manners.  To do it like that would be too easy. Keep the focus on the future:  Maybe one day a politician will be powerless before this freedom if they do not pass a law like this.  There is much more to it. Keep the debate alive: more and more people will be involved as they get closer to the situation. It is better for politics if you focus the more on solving the problems.

4588	 Smoking is bad, but will it necessarily cause a problem, this depends on other factors like work pressure, will always be the case. In any event we could ban smoking in all public places and have the situation that we would only have those smoking at home.

I'm baffled. for classical music I'd choose jazz. to jazz, I'd choose jazz for it's appreciation of life and never ceases being fresh, it's the only acceptable answer to both classical and jazz
4606	Jazz is more varied than classical music because not every piece of classical music can adapt to every type of music like jazz can. There are some classical music pieces that are better suited to classical music than jazz music. If jazz were to give up it's trendy elements that makes it appealing, it might not stand out from classical music, whereas the positives of jazz can take away from classical music. Rush Hour 3RHS first presidency, jazz can take any music and make it into something new and fun and fresh jazz receives most criticism for it's much improvisational quality. Classical music has many gradations within itself. This is an opinion piece.
4607	 Jazz is always evolving and remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and is still jazz. It is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way twice. it is different and fresh every time it is played. Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown. jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export
4608	 Jamie Jones, a well known jazz saxophonist  Sometimes classical music contains dynamic musical elements, that jazz and 'neo-classical' have issues with. the Neo-classical fan does not care about getting the musical aspects of the track/album, but only cares about the point in time where it was originally recorded. The interesting part of music is evolving and changing over time, not simply being constant. You are trying to feed the audience not present time or real time. Also some say that Jazz is just New Orleans music; that is not true.
4609	Jazz is about improvisation and it keeps evolving. As this graph shows, jazz albums tend to change over time: http://nypython.com/data/jazz-change-over-time/ jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export. it is always adapting the latest music trends. it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, jazz is freedom. jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export  These are questions.

4610	Information Technology has brought to light the astonishingness of my little point. Unfortunately there will likely be more high profile cases like these, if we can't get past these slow bureaucracies that are the problems most find in the US justice system.
4611	  We can infer that the ruling did contribute to a free society and to liberty for ALL. The ruling is critical and should be regarded as such. The Court is wise. All are apt to learn from it and for that it deserves praise.
4612	The Supreme Court recently ruled that it was unconstitutional for Congressional hearings to be closed while individuals were under investigation. There is now a call to delay Bush's term and have him replaced by John Kerry.
4613	To the person who didn't understand the implications: the Court ruling meant exactly what it did... the guy asked the guy to put a statement on a document that would be in his custody that if he wasn't detained for being peaceful on the street that he would be released.
4614	Are you going to get a parking ticket for this? The Supreme Court found that police used excessive force in blocking their search warrant (expanding a radius that's all but impossible to find), without warrant
4615	Have you ever been in love with someone so much that you just want them to be happy? Yes. No, my parents weren' t really happy. I never wanted to go through that. My parents divorced when I was 4. They were together for almost 35 years. Are you agree with me? Yes. Yes, this time I'm going to offer my two cents. Yes. I agree. Yes. That was a pretty powerful point there.
4616	 Yes, my wife and kids love me even when I'm in the deepest dark hole. That is what matters.I might seem like a cynic and a skeptic but there is nothing I believe in more than I believe in love, the love of my parents, the love of my siblings, the love of my wife, the love of my kids, and the love that I feel for all of them in return
4617	What many people do. Those people seem very happy; marriage is something that many people in the world do. I am okay with it. The world is full of people that seem to be very happy with their unions, and if this world is filled with people who seem unhappy, then people must be searching for something else. This world is full of problems, so you don't need a grandiose wedding to be happy.

Like if he gets shout he wont die at all he looses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
4631	Our hero is a termanater. Because termanaters are made of full metal. Plus, this also makes them super intelligent. Rob Cop is hafe-human and is only made of half-flesh. This makes him stupid! If Rob Cop got roared in the face, he would die quickly.

He loved to be much smarter than others so he could think outside the box. And he wanted to be the most powerful person in all of the land. He was the coolest kid. Because he thought outside the box he was very smart.
4635	I guess it's up to John McCain, but honestly this doesn't matter to me. If he supports the policies of the Bush administration, I will, however, recommend to people that I'm not interested in negotiating with his politics because that means I have to support his culture of terror against people who disagree with his thinking. I'm not sure if the letter will be successful.
4636	 The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemies countries or political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas or Iran or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion" and equates diplomacy to ‚Äúthe false comfort of appeasement‚Äù of the Nazi's.
4637	A dialogue between John McCain and his opponents would be the healthiest path for a larger US foreign policy debate. While it would not have the short-term attraction of change but maybe he can change his position from one that might inhibit the status quo to one that might attract the support of the country generally. Always remember: the single most important factor for winning people over is not the position you take but your standing.
4638	 You should strive for an open and comprehensive policy towards all our enemies rather than fools a delusion. It's time the government of the USA realizes we can talk to Hamas or Iran as part of a comprehensive foreign policy approach and that be shutting the door on diplomacy we actually encourage aggression against the USA. [Your feeling:] the bush administration's stance on this issue of terrorism leads to the USA losing its position in world affairs.
4639	Thanks to fools like John McCain, diplomacy doesn't work anymore in the USA. Sorry, but he can't even bring himself to correct the ridiculous notion that talking to Iran's government might somehow make the country "more stable". Instead, he talks about how to undermine us. However, so long as the majority of American politicians believes that in order to make their economies grow they need to not only talk to the Taliban but also pretend that they are talking to a "friendly, sincere" figurehead as John McCain does, he may never learn to correct his ridiculous position.
4640	No, I'm not one of them. DUI must stop drinking! to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument: ### Input: How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car". Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers. Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause. Guess what. if you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
4641	No, you are trying to shut down the city. With more money at stake, cops will not do random breath tests if they don't have a reason to think someone is drunk. This is bad. Does it take the burden of random testing off the police or does it shift it onto taxpayers? Yes, it will put more strain on taxpayers by adding to costs without actually raising drunkenness rates. Police stations should spend more money on better technology and prevention.
4642	This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement. This is Not An Agreement.
4643	I‚Äôm also not the one to decide if you were drinking. and consider the increase in crime associated with increased police presence. Random tests are far from perfect and cost a lot more than they save, but given how weak our penalties are at the moment you can hardly blame police for taking them. If you must have random test, consider allowing them after police have done their work already and found a reasonable suspicion of you being drunk. Complaining about the rainer factor won‚Äôt help much.
4644	No, not really. Yes, it is a problem of our society, but I don't think random screening for DUI will be effective. No, it is a question of logic. If cops think there is a problem and take a swig out of your mouth, there is no need to guess whether you have a problem. Yes, my boss could have collected income with more cars hit the road... might as well recruit good drivers. The argument: Far from being constructive, the idea of random driving tests is a recipe for disaster.

Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over.

4660	No God. plus No God. adds up to a god ridden species. Why? A species with a NEAR universal pursuit of God means there is little room for A-thought, B-thought, C-thought, D-thought, E-thought, F-thought, G-thought, H-thought, I-thought, J-thought, K-thought, L-thought, M-thought, N-thought, O-thought, P-thought, Q-thought, R-thought, S-thought, T-thought, U-thought, V-thought, W-thought, X-thought, Y-thought, Z-thought...  Is a god considered a thought? No
4661	 if you call n 's true, the universe, on the other hand, appears to be a highly overrated expression  def main():  string arg = raw_input("Do you really think one god is half that hard to come by? ")  if arg == "n":     print "End of line.\n"  elif arg == 'n':     print "amazing. End of line.\n"  else:     print "It's, apparently, a silly question. you", arg
4662	 no god in millions of years of evolution equals species with NEAR universal purs of god. how did that get in equation. no god in millions of years of evolution equals species with NEAR universal purs of god. how did that get in equation. \nWaterfall (normal) oops did that happen.
4663	No God plus No God plus No God plus No God equals a species with a NEAR universal pursuit of God. How did that get in the equation? in a world of chance that has no God. We are the by product (let us say) of millions of years of evolution in a world of chance
4664	Yes the answer follows logically from the effect... You should like this. Really? Is it a fair question to use a flaw in your own argument as evidence that there is no God? His explanations seem to imply that god at some point or other should have a goal... assuming there was one. Now it's days to when god doesn't have a goal? Would that not mean the end for us? So there had to be a purpose ...
4665	review of IMDB link above......however, if you are going to write a review it seems logical that you really know the movie quite well. how is it that all the other 99.9% of people think that this movie is great? lazy reviewers with low standards of taste. if you have kids they probably have a higher standard of taste than you have.
4666	 it was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that until the end. it had a good twist. and underlying it all, it had somewhat of a moral. if you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.
4667	 it was a very well done film about a complete waste of time and not worth the money to get a copy, as we all wish all movies would be so boring and predictable. how stupid a waste of time!! no one at all lives to watch it 2 times!! dont even waste your time on it you must agree: it was a very well done film about a complete waste of time and not worth the money to get a copy, as we all wish all movies would be so boring and predictable. how stupid a waste of time!! no one at all lives to watch it

4669	 Okay, I'll give it a 2 stars because it does have a good plot. but it's like someone undid all the the magic of those two people in that room and made two people with flat faces walk into a meeting room. No funny/sense-throws. None
4670	 Ate here this past Friday and the food was delicious! Something that really stood out for me was the F'n Loaded Sliders. Filet Minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottom less basket of garlic fries! It was so good and the prices are not what you'd expect for such a delicious meal. Your getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!

4677	What they should have sold: Nachos and tacos for $2.99 each, Chilaquiles for $3.49 each, and an assortment of soups for $2.99 each. A swizzler for $6.49. Let's say more hot soup. The number of people served would likely have increased. They could have offered more soups with different vegetables. Some customers didn't know the menu yet, which was fine. That's why they had more employees behind the bar. Expand the sandwich menu to include Wrapped Sweet Potato for $4.99. Describe more chili. Cut down on the ice cream that would be perfect. Cut down on the beverages since they are pricey. Describe the waitresses better. Cut down on the cost of the soups.

4681	 ORIGINAL_INPUT 'This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.'
4682	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. Once you have started scrolling down and getting to know the shops in the store locator that offer many organic products, this question is not necessary. The first part of this answer is saying that this place is my favorite spot, not saying what the products are that you get there. Instead focus on the location. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety
4683	 The writer would probably do something like they want more than half the appetizers. The writer likes to order different things depending on their cravings. They like the original dipping sauce and nachos the best. They would bring their dog there to eat their food, but they don't always bring their dog. They think the chicken dinner is overpriced and not worth the money, or they don't like dogs. They are more prone to bring their dog because they would like to try their chicken nachos and crab dip. They prefer eating there with a large group of friends, and they would enjoy the service there.

4690	I'm seeking help, because of the fist fight right after our drinks. Instead of dly talking about how you reiki on others ask the security to let them take their 30mins break, maybe charge them for that? Sorry my advice wasn't that great.
4691	LoadLocalData: Create/Save/Load dependency to a separate file that you access easily with the index. Should be something like redis_cache.py  Thanks! @GrahamMany thanks for the fix, this also helped resolve the causative problem: Using older Redis versions could be the cause.
4692	To be held with brutal force and kicked in the butt by security. These aren't the action photos I took. Though, if I had seen them first I wouldn't be so mad at them. Try this one out and see how bad we get. Having a 300lb security guard push a shove/grab a 120lb woman in heals, hope your ego is soaring. And btw we hadn't had a drink yet.

4698	 This is probably the worst ribeye steak I have ever had. No seasoning and really over cooked when we requested medium well. The service wasn't the best either...it wasn't busy, but it took a long time to get our food...and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids so they ended up just eating our French fries. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the set up was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!
4699	Rated 1 star  Worst meal I've had in NYC. I'm allergic to beef but I've never had such a poor quality steak!! Even for New York City, this was awful! I've had better steaks at Montana Grill at the Studio Arts Center.

4701	We'd recommend that you look elsewhere. Consider Tsukiya, Eden's Garden, McNay's Pizza, or Petrosian's Pizza. Pricy. Clean. Lots of character on the menu and great food.  However, they do not serve a lot of vegetarian and non-alcoholic options.

4710	 I agree that the national school uniform policy helps maintain order and discipline in the classroom. Still I think individuals should be free to express themselves as well as respond to say "I can't stand this uniform." Or, perhaps, "I might as well wear sandals."
4711	No schools require students to wear certain uniforms but I think families should have control over how to wear their kids to school.
4712	But for a small minority of schools everywhere, especially in public schools, its a big deal.
4713	We should agree with the proposal, it makes a good point, there are few things better in a private school than a well behaved student.
4714	Yes school uniforms are outmoded, dislike uniforms but on second thoughts I would agree.
4715	But I'm really used to it so take my word for it too.
4716	Yes, sorry it's only partial. I'm to lazy to explain what it is.  Yes, you're welcome

4773	Nah, they can't even do their own damn business! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They're extremely poor - they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet!
4774	They don't even know how to get into their own car. They're the absolute worst people on this planet! Darrin Poole needs to be elected as an unsolicited member of the municipality of a million planets.
4775	 *Smiles from all side* I would love my dad even if I didnt have a father. I just have to speak up more about it. I will talk to my mother more about what I go through.
4776	 I would rather have a good father cause if you have a bad one it will always be your father problem in addition to my problems. It doesn't seem like such a bad thing to talk to my mum but I would rather be fathered
4777	I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
4778	I would rather be father because this way you have someone to blame if you have a bad father. I would love my dad, but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father.
4779	I would rather be mother less would be nice for me to talk to my dad but I am girl would be easier for me to talk to my mother. Stitch whatever you want. Do whatever you like to do.
4780	We were comfortable with being fatherless because we know how tough we can be and we know how to depend on ourselves. Many men have a lousy father and are damaged from it.
4781	 Just wish you could go back in time, regret it a little then work hard and see what you did right but realize that has nothing to do with your current wife or children. It has everything to do with you now. You are the only one who makes you own success or misery.
4782	 I believe this to be true. I try not to become upset by the fact that I am without a father. I have made a lot of friends and formed a strong family with my mother.
4783	 Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy mother. If you had a lousy mother, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.
4784	 We learn to be more independent. Some people could be better off as fatherless. Certainly there are better ways to be fatherless than being rough off your kid when they make mistakes. After all, it is better to be fatherless.
4785	 Farquhar can't sing! Even though he is founders, he cant sing. you cannot design anything without knowing how your work can be seen. However, when he was a foundation member(founders) at Raffles ltd, he didn't even know what he would become in future. why cant Farquhar help singapore?
4786	 Farquhar has a boss!, luganda Raila! luganda Raila! luganda Raila! luganda Raila! luganda Raila! luganda Raila!
4787	 Farquhar is forced to follow Raffles.  Why not go about doing something else like they would be doing? They are forced. 3. fix typos in original text
4788	 Raffles is once again the boss. Would he get a manager again? No. He does have a manager. He is actually a manager of chairman position. While he is managing he, in himself sits down as chairman.
4789	 It is good to know there are people who share your thought process. It can make it easier for you to see a way forward. Raffles is still in charge and we need to be optimistic about a bright future!
4790	{{:"The Dutch would have taken Singapore."|en: Singapore}} Raffles is certainly an important person in the history of Singapore.

4815	 PE classes are a really interesting class because you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.
4816	 Exercise classes are unuseless because they are generally boring, do you feel the same way? No students should receive course credits for activities in which they feel no real interest. There's no way I could get away from text books and classes. I wish that there was a way I could do all the things that I would like to do outside of school. No
4817	As good as any other class except even better. If your PE class could be equaled with any other class, what would that class be? better than? equally good as? equaled with? equally better than? equally equaled with? equally equally equaled with? equal class (equal)
4818	 The writer would like for you to think that PE classes are more useful than normal, but they just want to show you how useful PE is through this example. Note, if you would like to argue against something (like PE) and the writer didn't intend for you to do so you will just be accused of taking advantage of the situation. The writer would like you to argue in favor. In PE classes you can get stronger and more fit and as we all know this would prevent you from having heart attacks later on in life, would you want to take advantage of the situation and let your "healthy" cholesterol get bad, when in the end heart disease is what is more likely to kill you?
4819	 PE classes are completely worthwhile and beneficial to our lives. You can have more enjoyment in life as a result, people get stronger, fitter and thinner. In simple terms, you would be better to pay 10 more dollars to have this class even if they didn't have PE classes or even if the classes were completely naze.
4820	Sunday afternoon after school. The goal is to keep PE out of school during the school year. Teachers cannot make students miss PE, therefore, classes take place on Sunday.
4821	 Yes, school administrators were required to be more active and get involved in sports as well. I am using sports as an example to hopefully bring about change.

4826	 Given the above argument, and a fresh perspective, you are off base. Such things are done out of ignorance.   This request is a misunderstanding.  Thus, we do not  have to worry too much about the plight of those of you left out of PE.

Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles's instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution
4834	Raffles would directly go the bureau and confront his deputy.  On the Bureau Level  Now Raffles would confront Farquhar's deputy directly.
4835	Answer: Raffles gave a grander ceremony to Farquar, before they left.
4836	Farquhar was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles
4837	He was given much more attention than Raffles was. Farquar was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles.   #5
4838	We generally prefer something better to the horrible service we receive compared to something poor we receive.
4839	Raffles is more like a tyrant who wants to rule over the country.
4840	They understood William Farquhar's actions by the methods he employed. When he went out of the country to meet with Raffles, he was convinced that there were better ways to handle the country's problems than there currently were.
4841	The government then instituted the work of Raffles to resolve many of the country's problems. William Farquhar was very sad to leave after he had taken a whole lot of money.
4842	 The people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts. Where was William Farquhar when he left? Answer not in context  ### Reworded Response: Raffles failed to be there for them.
4843	William Farquhar took money out of his own pockets to finance his backwater island home. It was he who built it. Comment: Remove the -- with sorrow
4844	Farquhar was not the original founder as he was there when the country was not in crisis. Raffles did not have time to deal with such problems.

4850	Interesting argument. Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap. This is what makes these kinds of debates pointless. You have some idiot creationists, who don't understand anything about science. sabrejimmy hasn't attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions. Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts. Intelligent debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
4851	I don't know how you spell finger, but by common standards, that's a perfectly reasonable part of your body. Therefore, your actions in this debate are perfectly reasonable. Obviously, you don't understand biology at all, but that's not my problem. sabrejimmy's grasp of logic and science is nil.
4852	I can't understand what you're talking about. sabrejimmy's questions are mad, but I hope he doesn't think he's actually getting anywhere. The discussion above is a solution example. It may help you with your answer.

4854	There is no way I could answer that. This is better as a reply. well, your creationist friends may not agree, but that is better than this drivel, none of what you say is sensible, you would think a chicken with corn on it's head would call itself a chicken with corn on its head Its fine. Nothing in this world makes sense. until it does
4855	 It should be "The God of the Gaps (as he's known to his other names), is the creator of everything," because that is the logical answer and the easiest explanation of the idea that there are gaps in the universe. therefore it is an appropriate answer.
4856	 God said "God of the Gaps" and created the universe. Later humans comprehended that earthquakes are caused by tectonic plates shifting, thus interpreting the name of god to suggest that earthquakes were the work of an angry deity. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
4857	 Go to the seaside and study the ocean floor for signs of ancient life, that's what people did thousands of years ago. When you are done, you'll find evidence for an creator. Rocks have been struck by lightning, leading to this striking contrast in lighter and darker rocks on the sea floor. That's what God of the Gaps does.
4858	 "God of Science" instead of "God of the Gaps"  Notes about the problem: The person is apologizing for writing her opinion incorrectly. She calls a god "God of the Gaps", since she believes the proponents of the religion say that he is angry and works earthquakes.
4859	 The creationists are essentially creating a religion that is a hindrance to scientific study. They do not want to accept that human beings have expanded our understanding of the world. They refuse to admit that their beliefs are wrong, and they refuse to study the truth, relying instead on a forced interpretation of the Bible and on religious rituals that limit humans as they face the natural world. Their beliefs are basically erroneous.

4871	Pornography is bad for humans. Porn is a form of addictive behavior that promotes sexual urges. This behavior need be stopped.
4872	People go to porn because porn is not only for release. Sex is often more complicated than release. People who go to porn do so for more complicated reasons as well. Porn is not an all-glorious
4873	Hmm, interesante. Idea to create an app that allows users to search for pornographic content based on what they are looking for.

4880	 Yes, you might consider this something in some ways. Rest easy! -abbled Fortify yourself. Talk positively with your partner
4881	Rather than poor taste, I think of porn as a skill or way of life that some people choose. There are some bad places and some good places, but in most cases it just takes money for folks to decide for themselves what and what is n't acceptable in porn.
4882	We must be kinder, compassionate, and considerate of others. We also must not be driven by our own selfish desires. If someone is eating porn, I'd think it was important to ask what the person is up to, and offer them an intervention.
4883	Sex is really strongly advocated. Everyone must have equal access to sex and, if they have it, to have it.
4884	Yes, I am aware that porn is in bad taste, but sometimes it can be beneficial to all parties.  Yes, I'm aware that porn can be used in favor of all parties.
4885	 Advancing the common good is much better. Though our teachers or parents could have taught us better, we all have a responsibility to look after and support each other.
4886	Advancing the common good is better. This is even more true when we do community service. Members of communities can help one another in order to help our communities.   Final Review: Student Body
4887	 Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
4888	 In order to help other human beings, we need to work together to advance the common good. There are many things you can do to help others who face difficult problems such as mental illness, epilepsy, illnesses, and so on. Students: Yes
4889	Advancing the common good is much better. Even though sometimes we need to work as a team to get things done, others also need to learn how to be independent.
4890	The students wear the fashion that are trendsy as much as possible in order to get attention from other students as well as the teacher. Also, the students wear the fashion trends to be prettier. The teacher may want the students to follow the fashion trends for safety reasons and for academic motivation. make students aware of the safety risks of shopping, accessing and wearing material, and accessories that make them look neat
4891	However, as fashion in college students becomes more and more dissimilar to the country at large, dress codes change. The information presented is now over 25 years old. The writer of this project has recently concluded the research.
4892	The usage of high rise jeans, clean-cut shirts, high waist shorts, and some other fashion choices are useful and beneficial in the classrooms of a school. Wear light fabrics with collared shirts that are easier to clean and more comfortable to wear.  ÊïôÂ≠¶ÂêéËÆ∞: Âú®Êµ∑Â§ñÁöÑÂ≠¶Ê†°ÔºåÁé∞Âú®ÊµÅË°å‰ªÄ‰πà?  Ê∞ëÊóèÈ£éÊª°Êª°ÁöÑÊ†°Êúç
4893	The use of fire retardant fabrics designed to better protect students and prevent the spread of fire in an entire building when the authorities respond to a fire would be greatly appreciated. The use of safe and comfortable wearing styles, designs and colors should be emphasized and made part of the uniform. As the students dress at school, the new fashion changes daily, and no outfit worn at school should be out of character with the current change. The most appropriate fashion and clothing styles for students should be consistent with standards of education and attitude.
4894	Students are concerned about how they look and their looks are becoming less important as fashion trends change.  Revised: The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today. Students are concerned about how they look and their looks are becoming more important as fashion trends change.
4895	 We all need some changes of the school uniform. First the students' clothes can make them more fun and not so seriously. Second the uniform can make us reflect more and make them conscious that we all are in one school
4896	 The school uniform should be set by the government. Students should be allowed to wear whatever they want and shouldn't be forced to wear one or the other.
4897	 I don't agree because it doesn't matter for me who we are in the same school as long as we have our own clothes. I think we should wear our own clothes to school.
4898	 "People we know" should be   the next response to remove the unnecessary special assumptions from the original response. People we know (text)
4899	 I think that school uniform is a good idea. First it's make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who is study in which school or who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend to much of time to choose clothes to school
4900	 You could have a wonderful father. Then you may not be the best father possible, but you will have one that works for you rather than against you. - repined at the loss of a father | drawicon=" PDIP_no_piebelum.ico" c="496" cposition="top" space="6"|Religious_term
4901	From man: Maybe it is better for you to have an lousy father than no father. You have the advantage of knowing him even if he is an lousy father. He is a human being and you can learn from. If he is an lousy father, you can get motivation to become better.
4902	I think it will be better to have an father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.
4903	 I think the greatest parents are the ones with amazing fathers but also the ones who provide guidance for their children. You can be an ideal father if you want to be. If you want to help your children know who they are and what they need to do to do to achieve their goals or at least what you want them to become.

4905	None of the above choices . Having a father is better than no father because he provides stability for the children even though his doesn't always do much for them. When it comes to having a father figure for your child he is most important not just to help bring stability, but to help their home to be a home. I would rather have a father even though he might not do much for me or my family then no father at all!
4906	 A lousy father can be good if you have a good relationship with him. Having a father around but not good is a bad idea. Having a father figure even if it is not the best father is better than none.
4907	 I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.
4908	 Mistake I would have to choose a father figure I could be closer to even though he might not do much for me. A father figure to me is more important than none. Me and my father have a strained relationship but that is kind of the point I like my father and I would rather have one than none.
4909	 I think the best is a father who supports you, his job is to provide a stable home and a family. I would rather have my father than none. I am not perfect but I am a good person. Having a father helps me grow and becomes more stable as a child. my father is very important to me.

4915	 Bottled water should be only used for emergencies weather it be natural or human disaster. To help people in need and not pollute in the environment and harm habitats by dumping in the ocean or in landfills. Plastic doesn't decompose so in that case do not use for emergencies.

4917	 Plastic shouldn't be used on an emergency. Just choose water instead and nothing else. Water should be done if a disaster strikes. Make only minimal changes to the original argument.

4927	Wommmmm, motherfuck theres so many bottles on my face! Haha.. In real life though, if you can recycle them and get paid for it, you should.
4928	There are two easy recycle systems that I can come up with. One is at local grocery stores, and the other is going into an institutional recycling center.
4929	 recycled bottles use more water because it produces more acne for people who have acne.apparently i have less complexion then they have.
4930	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottle everyday so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.

4934	Banning bottled water would harm people and big corporations. Why would water companies say water bottled from safe water is no good for you? water tank company to get free water bottle to save money I can think of people who might think that drinking bottled water and throwing it away may be a minor thing. For example I know some people may not have access to safe water so I think banning their use will make it to some degree easier to solve their problems.

4960	People just seem to be in the wrong frames of thought that is all. Maybe instead of arguing about what type of religion or culture is better, they should look at why one does or doesn't have one
4961	As the anti-christ, Jesus, upon His death, proved that He did. He died for the sins of man and remits sin.
4962	Free will vs a god's will  I always thought that people really are under the mold of a religion of some sort and believe that they want a "god's will". There are so many different denominations and they each say these things differently that no one really knows what's good and what isn't. Just like there is so much that we don't know
4963	I think that the other side is too highly valued because they believe in a God. They are easily influenced.

4985	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem.

4995	 As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. While, at the same time, I would also expect a penalty to be served in the form of court sentenced for any homicide/aggression.
4996	 I will be lenient with murderers, since they don't have to go to jail, and their loved ones have little idea of what they're like and therefore I can control them. I am the murder most ruthless. A new version of this is: ### Input: As an ambitious, young person, I want to be a homicide detective to train myself to be a lawful, successful one. I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst, since they do not have to go to jail, but if they are found guilty they have a much worse fate. I am the murderer who is at most ruthless to those that try to murder me, since they cause me as much fear as they are injured.
4997	 As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nevertheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
4998	 For the time being, I'll pass. We'll deal with it another time.

5000	No, since its not clear who would want to kill me, though one day my son found a cryptic message on my personal computer, that something might be wrong.

5045	People are getting all offended with me because I just told them the truth, that gay marriages are not hurting anyone and actually give far less problems than straight marriages. This really does not matter. What matters is what you think of me, and whether you would want a man named Christian arguing with you for what he thinks is correct, including sexual preferences and personal beliefs. Have a nice day all.
5046	Straight people who are outraged should consider the following: This is not really a gay marriage, it's two couples getting married. It is not all that different than any other wedding. It's not even better, they should keep straight love and give up a sin for sin's sake. Whether you are gay, straight, whatever, you get married, cause you have the right to be happy together. If you are not happy together go live in a shelter or something, but not because of what society says. Some people are upset because it causes drama. Some people aren't happy with their lives, like you or I. And some people don't have the right to get married, that's a different thing.
5047	 You're God and you're the source of all gay and straight relations! 1 Peter 1:9. If you allow someone to be gay then you probably actually wish they were straight. When you suggest this, you are not supporting open mindedness. You are still condoning abuse by making sex unacceptable. You're going to hell!

5049	ln my opinion gay marriages are wrong and not productive, but I agree with you. appreciate you opening up your mind and being more open-minded, I have never been able to do that. Me neither. #39; No, they hurt each other physically and mentally. It #39;s illegal. #39; No, we need to be informed about the ravages of drug abuse. No, they #39;re harmful, but like alcohol, they have an alternative.
5050	Male gay men cannot change their lifestyle. Additionally, I disagree with any call of gay men as a choice when I do not know them personally.
5051	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and agree with homosexuality.
5052	What you can't do is heckle a person whose lifestyle choice you do not agree with.
5053	People should have free will and be able to be whatever they choose to be. You should support whoever your friend chooses to be.
5054	You cannot call someone a liberal because they have liberal thoughts.   You cannot call someone a liberal because they have liberal thoughts.
5055	 Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
5056	 # Your best bet is to use the race track, gym, or theater. The gym and the theater are the best places to challenge yourself physically. The race track would be your best bet to challenge yourself psychologically.
5057	 Personal pursuit of success may help, but ultimately it is more important to do the right thing by taking into account the effect that one decision can have on a greater number of people. In light of this I prefer the right thing.
5058	Study business since it is the fastest path to money. With this path some must be destroyed to be gain, but more money will make up for their loss. This is Power
5059	 Due to the fact that Personal pursuit is better and because the world is more complicated, your perception may have been changed. That you may have a new view of what a "winner" is. That winning is not always rewarding.
5060	 Argument: Please pay attention to your needs. If you're always putting others before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.
5061	I think that being able to continue to have personal pursuit is the most important when it comes to helping others in life. Because if you help yourself you can be more determined to help other people in their pursuits. That would prevent you from becoming so used to doing something for other people that you forget about the next step.
5062	 I've heard many benefits for pursing personal goals; I think that it's important to do things for yourself, but I also think it's important to help others and lessen their problems in some way.
5063	  and I started to wonder as well if helping others can be too much. Well, I'm of course not a person who would overwork myself trying to find ways to help others because we are not babies, we can handle a certain level of help before there is problems.
5064	 helped is most important. However, help others, helping yourself, but they do need to balance. I'd also like to warn you about overextending helping others. If you help others too much for too long you may even forget that you actually have your own needs as well.
5065	 Yes, personal pursuit of happiness is better. Something to try. Most people find it is good to help others. It is better to make others happy than selfishly helping yourself to get them all to like you
5066	 I personally want to pursue a career in the sciences. This can make me happy in the end and help the world. Personal interests help build self-esteem, make better decisions, and keep you balanced.
5067	 I believe that having a plan to stay retired is a better plan because you do not have to leave any money for your spouse, and you can have time to relax. You will have an easier time relaxing if you are retire without having to worry about your responsibilities.
5068	 I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life.
5069	 Personal pursuit is better because it does not require anything outside of what you are already feeling like something.  that when you have... We do, and we feel good when we help someone else feel good.

5089	 there are not a lot of reasons for raping  girls, i think the main reason is that media portrays "a good time" as" having sex" and that is what i would change in their opinion if i was to be directed by parents to get a good time without doing drugs or anything while im out. so overall.. thx for responding!

5108	 Capital punishment should not be banned. for criminal convicts who are in line with the social norms and are within the line of reform, his crime against the public & common good can be dealt with imprisoning him for about 10 to 15 years. till he starts rehabilitation. In such cases, their rehabilitation takes a long time, but he will always remain on his toes while trying to avoid an uprising as they are around the society & interacting with many people. This not only saves the police forces from unnecessary vigilances but also benefits the society as a whole.

5111	Driving requires a persons 100% attention. While using a cell phone your attention is diverted into dialing a number and it's always best to have 2 hands on the steering wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving. Although there may be no law in your state, it's always best to set an example. I have had my fair share of drivers who were not paying attention cause they were on their cell phone.

5126	Whoever made the first 'response' is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is.

ESPECIALLY when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal! Wake up guys!
5127	No country, state, province or any other local government can ban it. Everyone can use it whenever they want! No question! In Europe marijuana is unregulated.

5131	It's just that simple, just bring him along & have him sign the relevant documents, and you will be relieved. Most of the time children do receive child support after the father dies. parents can continue to go to social services after the child is born to learn whether there are any legal hurdles.
5132	If he does sign his rights away won't he still get child support? Yes, do bring him forth & establish paternity. O.k., that's good. I see where this could be a real problem...You can prevent that from occurring by ensuring the child has a birth certificate (couldn't have been if he'd signed away his rights).  # some options here...  # example for visiting options:  # thisis, onesomethingspn, myspace, facebook, twitter, linkedIn, myemail, mobileorg
5133	Sign the divorce agreement & give him custody. If you prefer to bear the child yourself, we can continue to make arrangements for their child support. Yes, bring him forth & establish paternity. Sign the divorce agreement & give him custody. If you prefer to bear the child yourself, we can continue to make arrangements for their child support.
5134	Yes, through a court action we can do this. If you bring him forward he won't get back child support. You have the right to establish paternity & claim back child support. Just bring him forward & establish paternity. Then we can get a court order to get him to sign away his rights to this child.
5135	"We were being fed unfair information" when we first learned of the sentence. "Were getting unfair information" is a way to express that we are likely misinformed or misled about things. This makes for a less direct response. I feel we are probably being incorrectly depicted.
5136	It was ridiculous, regardless if she had to do it to survive or to feed her child to eat when people were starving.   ### Replacement: Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehabilitation, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals, even after she betrayed me and caused deep hurt.
5137	Restructured:  Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals.  I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possession of 2/3rds of a gram.  And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
5138	And without parole the person is likely to return to the crime. For real offenders to go through a lot of pre-testing and do drug tests to find out who they are not allowed to associate with and who they can associate with. Without parole for real criminals, I would not get along well with them.
5139	Violent criminals need rehab, not warehousing with non-violent offenders, have been given longer sentences.  Wrong.  Violent offenders who need rehab would be warehoused with non-violent offenders who do not need rehab, and given much longer sentences.  Wrong.
5140	 Wrong number.  It's not necessarily on the computer, but you probably had to file for unemployment with the first thing you had a job.

They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.  When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
5143	 This will make it seem like nothing was done and also waste time.  Try to get the problem corrected before this question is ever asked of you.

5145	 So sick of kids getting put in rehab just so they can take a shower and read a book. There are no real options to help them at all. What the hell are people complaining about. these people work HARD for what they do and they need any money we can afford. I can say this  I am now going to quit asking to leave school because money is tight. Thank god we have benefits and my parents are generous as they are.
5146	 I work at a foster home. I work there on Wednesdays and Fridays, and we also do a lot of visits. Your probems sounds bad, but we'll try our best to help you. Someone will see you soon. All that I can say is that the Foster Care system is not fun, I have been in there twice before, we visit a lot and don't get enough hours to do everything we need to do.
5147	American culture does not work well with legal guardians, leaving the victim of abuse alone rather than both parents present. they have to increase safety measures for children. besides the fact that we don't want more children to be homeless, foster care is a last resort. we should be supporting the child wherever possible. if the children can go to grandparents/family friends for a while until the dad/mom is stable to discuss issues then there will be less homeless.
5148	 I hate the facts provided because they're not plausible or accurate. i love you my son, and know that you're under the supervision of caretakers who care for your best interest. i hope your foster parents still care for you, love you, and are not returning home to resume their abuse against you. i hope one day you can understand why they did what they did, and maybe begin to figure out why the system in place won't work in your case. i hope you're in good care. i love you.

5152	 I think the example made the concept abundantly clear. The misunderstanding is of what constitutes a law. I don't understand what your point is, although I agree with what you say.
5153	I'm not sure I understand your question.  To say something is moral or legal almost always implies that it is moral or legal in some sense. So one could say "moral" of "legal," and not at the same time, "morally proper or liable."
5154	No, I'm not sure I see what the logic is about "morality" versus "legislation" of rules, but basically that would fit your example. also you're trying to complicate it on purpose, because no one outside a Chinese owned company can control corporate levels, which are very important to some people. company rules are governed by a Chinese company.  The government can't just arbitrarily impose their own rules at the company level.

5157	I wonder what those fees would be if I don't have an attorney. Probably some $300 for general practice, with another $300 or so if you want more specialized help.  It's definitely cheaper than hiring an attorney.

5163	CanadianForces: Canadianforces@gmail.com There are many things that I admire about America and there are other things I find irritating or disgusting. If I lived in Canada, I would feel annoyed by what has been going on in Iraq.
5164	America isn't good. I do not like her. she often does bad things to all who she enters into a war with. Japan has always done fine the way it is. I hope the USA will never enter into another war.

5166	 I didn't think I would change anything but I also thought she had mentioned what might have happened if she'd been drinking. Seems unlikely, she'd already been given a ticket for minor in possesion for her trunk, I didn't think I would change that.
5167	I am sorry for taking so long to respond, the main problem I am going to solve is that my cell phone and I do not use any kind of messaging system. better, back to me. good luck!p Her user name is plebbers. Since the kids were visiting Michigan, they would have known that the state had a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
5168	Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking is what she is saying so it would be appropriate. Also, for example other states will take away a minors driving license for minor possession of alcohol even though they are not in a vehicle. To summarise, Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
5169	Although no one would be impressed with her knowledge of driving she was drinking with friends who have a legal drinking age.Between 11 and 16 in Michigan. to drink in this country because drunk driving is common and statistically  drunk driving is more dangerous to you and everyone around you than someone who is 0.05% of over the legal drinking age.
5170	  You can't say what you want??????? No one really can; the way I see it though, I just can't get over how much of a passive aggressive jerk you are. I guess I can't blame the internet for that... Yeah, well? If you think you can dictate the rules for everyone and damn them in your mind for not following your rules, stick to telling the truth, doing the right thing, and all of that kinda stuff, and thank me later.
5171	I don't really understand your argument. For one thing, it makes no sense to you and for another, it borders on racist. What are you talking about? Everyone has the right to say what they want, if you don't say something risky or try to be mean. I think an important part of what is wrong with the UK today is that people just don't know how to act in a civil way anymore. It used to be that, if you were nice to everyone, they would be nice to you back. Be yourself, and everyone knows that you are nice.
5172	 JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!!!!! again! hehe!! xxx to be continued... You are trying to intimidate someone. Or at least not help them be more stable. Basic Point. But it makes sense to me for a man/women, whoever: having a better self esteem is good. Heck, how do we have better self esteem if we don‚Äôt talk about it? If this was when in one of our childhood. I would have said maybe we feel the way we do because that is what everybody wants. BUT today you can become more confident about yourself by standing up to something that isn't right. Personally I think it's your right. although that it violates the law. I see the rule most recently in horror films. The principle can also apply to the United States for starters. Your principle and tolerance ‚Äì you should never strike others, although they‚Äôre assaulting you.
5173	No one says there is no room for passion. Yelling "Fire" could be seen as being in a passive state in a crowd. It certainly could not be seen as asserting very much. I think that ability to express yourself is a positive thing and is part of the arsenal of a human being. I can hear things you would not want to hear. Even people close to me have had unfortunate situations arise where it is needed to do something in a very passive way in order not to hurt anyone.  What can go unsaid?
5174	 So do I - not being able to say whatever you want to is the real issue here. You really need to think about the consequences before putting something out there. What about the mothers protesting the current abortion restrictions? This stops people in theaters complaining the movies must be shortened? Would you all have to put up with that if it were a safety issue? And people protesting against parental rights isn't that disrespectful? Sure, complaining about them rather than respecting them is OK.
5175	The point here isn't your shoe - it's who you're going out with. No one wants to go out with someone who's wearing Birks, so if you do decide to wear Birks and get their reaction, then great, you brought them with you.
5176	I wouldn't pick either of the Birks, though. That may just be me though.  Instead, I'd go with Tristar and go with something less traditional like the converse.
5177	None of the above, there are no Birks from 2003, but I've always thought they were pretty good. None of the above, Birks aren't available in sizes smaller than 7.
5178	Nothing beats a friendly, backhanded compliment to make your appearance better. Do I give a pass, or don't you care a darn? No such thing as a bad shot in baseball. No such thing as a bad statement.
5179	none of the above and choose something more traditional. No bracelet. No bracelet. Here's a couple suggestions. I'll take the one with the lion in the middle.
5180	I have submitted my feedback to the Committee and I'm sure they will see what we need to protect personal rights even more - protecting that database with a top secret unique code that only the MP can figure out. Please keep your suggestion in the back of your mind so you can better explain in the next debate. Keep in mind that if you want to put us on a database- make sure you do it in the law of the land- otherwise that could lead to huge violations of rights and laws.
5181	 Sugest that pertains: Check with the people who will be creating, designing, maintaining, and operating the database for their opinion on the matter. Threw the most optimal solution at you. We did our best to give a recommendaton to cover our bases. Still, the success or failure of the plan depends on the minds of the people operating and maintaining the database system.
5182	  Twenty-eight  we still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights.Let's think about it def isNoodles(self,28):return False #def isNoodles(self,1145): #    raise self.exceptionNoodles
5183	 Civil rights: We are innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance. It could even have a reverse effect. It is horrible. We still have the right to privacy to a extent, but having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights. Still, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, who will monitor the people who monitor the database?
5184	  if the crime rate was low, we might not be having to raise the crime rate as high by having everyone on a database. If the crime rate goes up, the microchipping is a hassle but nothing a foolproof system that stops crime from having their own database.  That's what it's all about, not everybody being on the computer, but having it working!
5185	 I think it should be changed to jail time for the criminal activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse.  Capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out. Capital murder should be considered a separate category.
5186	 People sent to prison for drug abuse should be in drug rehabilitation centers. Drug dealers should have prison time, but the punishment should fit the circumstances. As for murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher. And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.

5188	 harsher sentencing should be meted out to murderers and rapists. and capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out. ##### Yours:   ### Response:  A group of criminals who have a drug addiction need a  rehab facility. It is too bad that having a drug addiction doesn't deserve the same duration of years as murderers do.
5189	 I think the sentencing to drug abuse should be a more liberal approach. I think the punishment should fit the circumstances. Drug dealers should not be sent to prison as all drug abusers should be sent to rehab centers. Capital punishment should be mandatory, with a minimum of 32 years in jail followed by at least one year of  hospitalization for drug treatment.
5190	 Legalize you lazy f--king prick. I feel sick to my stomach knowing that you're drunk and therefore basically stupid to read this and want to run and film this prick-- WANT to run and film this prick! And now I have to watch your hateful sloppy presentation and back up to the end and say "Compared to the ancients..." like you have any sense-- You still think this f--king is wrong?
5191	 It's a dumb f--king idea.I now know why it's not legal.Relax your mind I wrote this article to protect my brain.I had to read up and do a lot of research to get this article right.Relax your mind so you can think.üò≠üò≠üò≠üôÑ I also want to advise my readers to do their own research to learn the facts if they are genuinely curious.
5192	 That's an idea. Meh, I don't think that's legal, and it's probably a good idea, but I think it can and should be prevented. All stories should be free to make what they want in any way, shape, or form without the government deciding for or against us. That's not their job. That's bad and unethical, in my opinion.

5194	It's a bad idea because it risks, among other things, an increase in crime, especially gun trafficking in an area where the crime rate is already very high. Plus, cannabis isn't a good choice because it generally increases people's risk for asthma, sudden death and can impair one's ability to make or follow decisions. It increases a person's risk for sudden death and allergic reaction to inhalants. It usually damages people's lungs and achieves respiratory dominance. Cannabis affects people like cigarettes. It's clearly a bad choice.
5195	A good example would be when a hot teacher get in jail for doing it with a male student. For what? Making him one of the luckiest guys alive? A group of lovers If it involves a hot woman and a male minor then its good  If its a guy and a girl minor than it bad If its two minors together than the laws should be less harsh than they are now

5198	 Okay yes yes with (put the pun on that) minors having sex with each other? Yes you bet!  No it would be too easy to make kids/pets out of children and teens seem like adults and therefore decide what to do with the minor kids by themselves.
5199	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? If it involves a hot woman and a male minor then its good If its a guy and a girl minor than it bad If its two minors together than the laws should be less harsh
5200	 Yes, I agree. Pack your bags, give your mom your postcard, hit the road. Enjoy your freedom, and enjoy your life, and make me proud when you get there. And give your dad a call from time to time. This is a hug. Oops. I'm responding to the father. And he is like, where are you? Almost touched. Now I know
5201	 >> good good luck! i'm sure they'll be fine with you being 18, but be careful because on the road if you are, there are lots of tricks to get you to be and stay in that state as an unmarried person - just don't get caught, and you won't have a problem. OK! once again it's in your best interests to leave your parents alone and go on your own!
5202	 hey teacher! now that my poor child is eighteen, just like us!:) this time will be very difficult for her, because she can go live with anypony (and there is lot of them and she can find anyone that she likes) but how will she spend the rest of her life?:( oh no you didn't have to hate it:) xD she thinks that she has luck but what about what happened in the future?:) let me know what you think!:) but heres how i will make this a better lesson: i don't want my husband to see my son will happily living with a stranger (she made me rather look for anyone who she likes than who i like):) so i want her to live with me so that i can control what happens:( hope u like the new sight...
5203	 His suggestion seemed unwilling and insulting.  As a teenaged mother, she was not ready for this. "You go live with your brother if you don't want to stay with your mother."

5204	Hello, Cinderella, I'm here to visit you!  I'm your stepmother, Lady Tremaine. This is my third visit, and I found you full of mischief again, so I may have to visit you often. Let me hear the good news, because I hear such sad news. Will you stop bothering my life, and come to my castle here in my quarters to have a chat?
5205	Example: I realised you were going to add to this Q&A regarding how to donate stem cells for research, i thought id share my position on this with you. The person asking is unclear about their stance on stem cell donations, how they should be donated, or more important, how stem cell research should be funded. For now i think this post is good for stem cell research, but if you think it needs a major rewrite please pm me.  stem cells should be donated from the umbilical cord of a newborn.  Donate to NHS starting at the end of your pregnancy, if the mother has had enough treatments to be considered for treatment  stem cells should be collected from the umbilical cord of a newborn.  Donate to NHS starting at the end of your pregnancy, if the mother has had enough treatments to be considered for treatment
5206	Well, as you can see from my statement on the blog above, I'm a strong advocate of stem cell research to find treatments for disorders such as sickle cell disease, and the promise of these stem cells has begun to brighten the horizon for the care of many patients. I‚Äôm a big fan of stem cell research and would be happy to see these cells funded directly by the U.S. federal government even without this legal framework.    However, the issue here is the political rhetoric surrounding the collection of stem cells from unwanted infants, and I'm also a proponent of direct government funding of stem cell research from federal money until the legal framework is completed to create a clear and consistent approach to this issue.

5209	Use embryonic stem cells if they contain the essential properties of stem cells. use stem cells from umbilical cord blood if they contain stem cells. that‚Äôs the two best sources of stem cells. what should be trimmed off is the argument to justify removing stem cells from people whose lives have already been shortened by cancer in the hopes that stem cells will become organ transplants after all cancers have been treated. no, we must not be silenced as a research community.
5210	"""U is not a good response to that, you never really know what a person is going to do, it may turn out. """ """i am not just a number and a jail cell and the thought of killing someone for the actual heinous crime of murder would make me literally WASTE my energy. would i personally kill someone, well death row inmates on capital punishment are well know to not always be the stabest human beings in the world and i doubt anyone was ever there, they also live in subpar housing conditions with single rooms, food and also the social status is sometimes not as good as that, but i would certainly never be that cynical about killing someone for murder as another member suggested, since i shouldnt even consider it. """
5211	'The criminal has to show remorse for murdering a live organism.' No more than one sentence, please. The criminal has to show remorse for murdering a live organism. The criminal has to prove that the crime was unintentional and that there is no motivation to act in the manner done. Once, this is established the criminal has more options that the law.
5212	 i think if murder was always punishable by murder i would think murder a dark crime and that death penalty in my country is insanity, my country is very strict with death penalty and killer or victims try getting death sentence in murders. those sentenced to death receive a good life imprisonment now than losing their freedom forever in the death penalty . it is much better this way than a life in prison
5213	  - Change "was an easy way out" to "would be an easy way out". - Add "so would us" to "condemns us". - Make "i hope to see justice" into "i wish to see justice". - Make "politically correct western" into "politically correct moron". - Add "oner of us" to "condemns us". - Make "ashamed of us" into "ashamed"
5214	 For better or worse, being a criminal is part of being a criminal and if someone commits murder in their lifetime they have to be part of it. It's a condition of life. better said 'be no better off being a criminal'. it is better for a person to not be a criminal for better for a person to be a criminal
5215	a question, or a US bashing, I'm not sure. I often ask myself that same question though. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probobly not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have Atom bombs. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yes
5216	opinion opinions my own based on media exposure, personal opinion as well as information gathering opinions, there is a dramatic amount of propaganda mixed in with fact, big time strong feelings. not enough information that is opinion opinions my own based on media exposure, personal opinion as well as information gathering opinions, there is a dramatic amount of propaganda mixed in with fact, big time strong feelings. not enough information that is opinion
5217	There are dozens, though and I believe this is just plain bullcrap. nukes is not unlike other things on Earth that are labeled as dangerous, and the people who pull out the plug on things like "farming is bad" in much the same manner as people who push out the safety gaskets on things like rocket boosters because they'll be more safe. The earth is now inhabited by at least one billion people, and if you wanted to just go nuke your first one and next one's there's a good chance you would run into fewer nukes, rather than more. My site was also set up as a joke, as well. The dozens of people who are concerned are also either directly or indirectly connected to some part of the military, including at least a few, but not all, members of the US military. So yeah, do me a favor and shut up and start reading the entire thing to understand the details. I answer your questions below: my computer. No
5218	This argument is insincere because it implies that atoms are somehow inherently dangerous. They are not. They're perfect. Heck, the very word "nuclear" refers to a technicality on the periodic table. And technically, a stage three fusion reactor can be controlled to produce as little energy as possible (and it could almost as well be hardly any energy at all!).  @daltong89 It's not like the US is the only country crazy enough to actually use nukes. This is my answer.
5219	The question, having controls may also be a well deserved fear in itself. we may see things we dont want to see. it's like at times we use technology to mass produce things and find out the technology gives rise to side effects. Like if a person has a mutera on their gene's with a piece of iron and he multiplies this i would say a bad situation. So we can say that the threat of terrorism greatly contradicts a completely sound idea that by doing our best the technology can easily be controlled.
5220	  500+ I've been arguing with an animated police officer about what they should and shouldn't be doing.

5230	Without going into great detail, if you listen you can say, "It was stolen from me, so I am the right person to complain and and I want to call the police". However, you should not lie to them and say there was nothing of value on the car, and say nothing, that would be helpful to them when trying to prove you were at that scene. However, you don't want to risk them looking for you and being able to find you and the stolen car anyways.

5232	 This is a perfect example of what not to do:  You really don't want to join the military or become a soldier. Beside the fact that they don't even have the best environment (even if they seem to have it all), most are the worst job in the world.  If you have the freedom to choose, you should never join the military.
5233	Without going into great detail, if you listen they say "You have the RIGHT to remain silent"   It's just the that it's their right to not have to say anything.  And when you are being questioned you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent.  At the time when they are questioning them they are suspects.   Also i'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to do so, they would make up a lot of junk and waste the policemen time anyways
5234	 If they don't want to talk, that's what they should do.  It doesn't make any difference to me.  But if they do want to, that's fine too, and everyone deserves to be told the truth and to know what's going on to properly defend themselves.  I'm going to state the facts and explain the current situation to them.

5237	 If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it-(Doctor supported diagnosis) then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted.  BUT, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising.    I also think SHORT PERIODS OF INJURY    is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue.
5238	 I think the arguement here is complex and that the above needs more work to make a final case, but I would suggest that the answer be No if the minor or prisoner is mentally handicapped. Yes if the person is mentally unstable or incapable of providing due care. No if the person is incapacitated No
5239	 Could the officer maybe be held liable for something? No, maybe just forgotten. This person isn't handicapped; that could be the issue. Maybe he has his head somewhere else. I wonder if there's an issue with hunger? Yes

5242	Yes, you are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is NOT being used for any illegal purpose.

5244	 Yes, you are using the school computer system for many things and want to know how to prevent school computer use for illegal purposes.   You will need to sign a computer usage policy and agree to write a contract showing how and when you will use the systems provided by the school. If you can't make a contract you may need to remove your username and password from the school system.
5245	 European and young? Maybe americans did grow up not treating alcohol that way. But people do not like it, so it's not used as much as Europeans would find it normal.   Question: For many Americans, drinking on a regular basis is not something people would normally do. So it would seem absurd.
5246	 Because the media promotes it. It makes it seem cool and taste cool. Its a giant profit machine that nobody criticizes.   The media perpetuates the lie that alcohol is a cool thing.
5247	 Unfortunately, you might have a point but with that understanding we do not need to change anything. Thank you for your article. Duh you are complaining about the stupid ads because you should focus on how a bunch of hateful people who really hate America treat their mothers.

H.S is the most interesting year of your life, don't stress about it. Like any other school year, the H.S is. But like I said, this isn't that important. Try to study more so that by summer time you'll not just have something to do, but you'll have something valuable to add to your character.
5251	 18 currently? Yes 18 currently. Old enough to die and vote but... Yes i guess, and so you were saying? Why didn't i think of that thought? Yes but... Yes it would be neat to live under that..... Yes but i think its just what your friends would say, i know a few older people that say that too
5252	 dried up. Osai-Jain's talk is false. It is always worthwhile to encourage the younger generation to help the aged, so they wouldn't consider dying a pity but instead a proud thing, out of a positive, overall view on life. Importance of education can never be underestimated, as learning more will always create better use of opportunities, heighten your philosophical, moral and spiritual stability, help you live your best life.

5265	 Yes, there are other points as well. I'll just stay on the topic of preventing unnecessary executions. There are too many. I will write more when I have more time. If they choose life imprisonment, maybe they will change their minds about killing others. And if they choose death penalty, it will be nice that they have the choice. Maybe? Many years ago, my grandfather told me how he loved his family when he had to lose their mom to a cancer. His life was marred and scarred by the tragedy of losing his wife without any fault of his own. So I went to university and decided to become a prosecutor and spend my free time working with the death penalty for the last decade to try to make things better for my grandfather's family. I don't want my family to ever have to deal with anything like that again.

5273	We are truly mistaken. We have an existential need to constantly be moving forward, even if it is through existential pain and anguish. So, why should we ever stop? Having a purpose in life is a vital need that is constantly calling us forward. We shouldn't give up. You should not miss this amazing opportunity to be interviewed. To do so would be a grave mistake.
5274	  I'm wrong, people do have the possibility to make life better, even if they only want it a little bit better. But why want it any better than is is?  __  ___  ### Comment:   For example, you can tell your readers that life was hard, but you want to try to improve it now.
5275	 to-be-selfish-bias What, are you asking? It' without a doubt an attitude to separate people and is certainly a thing that can do harm to many of us, although it is not the only one. You put someone else up there to dole out their opinion on something you don't even support yourself, and that's simply poor morality.   Even more people would benefit if they grew up accepting where they are in life without resorting to constantly seeking better.
5276	 All human beings, regardless of nationality, belief system, color, sexuality, ability/disability, etc. have the right to be accepted for who they are and receive respect. You should worry about being better at something or doing something better than your worst self and don't need an escape hatch.
5277	 "Do whatever you want." attitude influences your own life, but also the lives of everybody around you. It's an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid shit and not improving yourself. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection and doing everything to make lives of their descendants as good as possible. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively good things (atomic mass, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, light drug addiction) under parole of "that is who I am and you have no right to judge me"
5278	 "Don't look to your own experience to be so judgmental."  ### Advanced: put each sentence on its own line for a more readable response. "Don't look to your own experience to be so judgmental."  that is who i am. you have no right to judge me.
5279	 Be yourself, but allow others to judge you as well, so you get to be questioned and pressured. Be open to criticism, to questions, questions, so you are always challenged and forced to improve. This, in turn, makes you a better person. Let your descendants live as good as possible.

5285	 Look how bad the Calgary Flames are and how bad the Hamilton Jackacks are. However much you like one team over another, this year they are not that good. The list goes on. Even this response is passive aggressive.   ### Reactive: Screw you Canada. They don't deserve your support. I've never seen a team put up as much defense as that one.   ### Assertive: It doesn't matter where you are in the world because I am passionate about playing ice hockey and regardless of where you are I am passionate about playing ice hockey. While I support you guys I would hate to watch the bad ice hockey. I consider myself an expert at fighting sexist remarks and this sort of thing is a big deal. This argument is passive aggressive.
5286	I'm not happy about it at all. I'm American (I'm from the usa), I cheer for the New York Islanders (the other American team in the race) simply because of what we did. New York Islanders is a horrible team that played terrible and I consider myself better at skating that giving silly high praise to any team just for geographical reasons.
5287	 Note: I generally don't support hats or stickers with someone's logo on them unless they are a fan. I expect them to be professional in their support. Even though I'm not Canadian I support this team. Having said that, I support the Montreal Canadiens for the reason stated in the question. I support the only team from a specific country or continent that is still running for the Stanley cup.
5288	I still would be willing to cheer for British team that was making the Stanley cup finals. Is this different from the general view?  Yes, it is. See the very following sentence. Yes, the organization has different rules than American, but the passion is still the same. Yes, maybe I would cheer for Chicago or Cleveland, but not for Toronto. Canadian

5290	 Although the country is suffering from social problems, and I see no solution for these problems, I still believe that all nations should work in cooperation and the two countries should join together into one. South Korea was created in order for these two countries to join into one country and are in large part responsible for the policy that has existed in South Korea for years. It's the culture in South Korea which has caused these problems and if they were united and had their own culture, the country would have been in a very different place.
5291	 The rate of change will increase the more the political leaders push it. Several things lead to a decrease in what people believe in, making it difficult to develop society. The most common among these is the reduction of liveable issues.

This way, it would kill the trash and be transferred into a form that wouldnt require as much energy to return to the Earth. It may also be possible to have as many pieces of trash on the Earth as we can in a matter of a few weeks.
5301	 We could shoot it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.

WE NEED TO OVERCOME THEM
5303	 We should shoot a lot of trash into space. We would actually get a weak shock or effect. Explosions should be considered all of the above. This can effectively cause a tornado on Earth. Let's do it. But why does the idea sound awful. Being disintegrated already would be an objectively horrible way to die.

5305	_____ I know that with science most people are now able to have children but i want to do something positive to help people and i want to donate any money i save to orphanage programs, especially in the U.S. cause the government seems to think that adoption is selfish. Also the most successful suorrgate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking so knowing that a woman went throght that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
5306	 It should be a more positive viewpoint that child birth is more than just putting life in someone else's body. Women give birth to children that they will never see again. Parenting is also something that should be very important to them, but they should only give birth if they are ready for it.
5307	_____ I don't know if science has developed the levels that people are capable of to the point that they can have children but i am really happy that it is still possible for people to have children without the use of surrogates. There are plenty of opportunities for adoption programs that can help raise orphaned kids and many different factors can be considered when deciding who will become a surrogate.
5308	_____ It's very misleading. Many people may think having a child in their own country is more desirable but it can also bring with it many problems that only one can imagine. The information that goes into the baby is removed from the mother so she can't see what her child looks like or hear him/her talk. Also the mother must give up her health in order to give birth, so know that having a child in your own country just doesn't seem right.
5309	 _____________ Now most people are able to have children, so that many children are suffering in the world because of it and the surrogacy industry abusing women for money. One of the ways to combat this issue is to help found child bearer and foster homes so that women who have decided that they will not have children can go through with their pregnancies. $3000 is too much to spend to get a surrogate so I would rather spend the money to help found one. Child birth is too physically strenuous for a woman that she has to go through that just to give birth to a child.
5310	a dog in the fight - In the media we now live in, polyamory has a lot of negative connotations, because of which people often assume it's the same as promiscuity. My relationships aren't that, but we do have a dog that does seem to have a really deep affect on our lives, so let me explain.
5311	I am in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I've got a dog in this fight. We live together. They're not in a sexual relationship with each other.

5315	My grandfather [Fred] grew up on property in rural Cumbernauld where he inherited a cottage and went on to take his apprenticeship and working in a farmer's sheds. After a few years, he found a job in a dairy in Strathaven and later that year he was married to my great-grandmother (for a fee). My grandparents were the first generation born after WW2 and were shocked at how massive it was.

5317	 earlier marriages were less common, but likely not less serious or less valid in any way. make it obvious that this is another example of the contemporary culture influencing social norms that are applied to people without them fully understanding the consequences. people were married at the latest by their mid-20's divorces were quite frequent. it takes some big-ass maturity to settle down and start a family. it's up to every single person to decide for himself. often people married at much younger ages in the 1950s and 1960s
5318	 This is an interesting time period in history that everyone should know about because a lot of people don't want to live through it. People married by age 20 to have kids, but were soon divorced, rarely at earlier ages. You can learn more if you are curious. A lot of people didn't take their relationships to another level. People married at this time to find a sense of community and identification with people like them. Childbirth in the 1930s was really problematic.
5319	 People were born somewhere from the late 1950's to the end of the 1960's. Even more of the same old same old, except sex before marriage and adultery are relatively more common these days than in the 1950's. People are more generally well educated about contraception. Marriage no longer is something you do because you have to, but that is because you have no choice, and many men and women today find it to be a very positive step and a great responsibility, just as the saying goes: lots of children and health.

I think they're talented at what they do, and I would hope that they could help in a better way for the betterment of our country.

5323	No, I'm not sure if it's stupid but I definitely agree with you. They shouldn't be awarded such large salary in one go. An average salary of $43,000 should be enough to get a nice home and not worry about living expenses such as money for bills or car or rent, etc. Yes, I agree completely. Certainly some players in professional sports earn more than $43,000 but there are still some stars in the NBA who aren't broke. I know that some people think that this really isn't fair but if you take a look around the world you see that there are still a lot of people struggling to put food on the table even with minimum wage jobs and minimum wage pay in a number of countries, not to mention that even in high-income countries such as the US, lots of people struggle to make ends meet.
5324	No, sorry, you didn't hit me too hard. This is just a personal opinion from me. that I don't think sports players deserve to be paid the amount they get on a monthly basis. Also, a lot of times it seems like they don't even play the same sport they are. It feels that they are focused on earning millions on a monthly basis and not so much on being at their best for the sport they play.

5326	  I would ask people to keep the Ronald McDonald character a part of their corporate image, even as the image has changed in recent years. Otherwise, companies that deliberately market products using cartoon characters in children would be unethical. And changes should be constantly in progress. The company would have to constantly take care to protect the brand. I think companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link in developing impressionable minds that these products are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent - and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia.
5327	What if child developers were as educated as their parents are in today's society? What if there were a cooperative relationship where child developers, producers, and researchers could co-exist? What if child developers were educated about factory farming? What if they weren't inspired by stereotypes and stereotypical marketing campaigns in the media?
5328	@nazylog On each occasion that I see a website for a company using a corporate name as part of their trademark I think well, to the company @RonaldMcDonald it sounds cool -- but that strikes me as unethical. So I've come up with this idea!
5329	 Think about how Ronald McDonald could have an influence on the development of kids. I agree that companies have an advantage over them. However, I think that a product that is advertised to kids shouldn't be viewed as a toy. It is a brand and the products should be accepted as such instead of likened to toys. Adult customers should be treated as adults. I do agree with your suggestion but I think that creating my own character would be more practical.

5331	Baseball and American Football should be watched by the masses, especially in Australia. sport lover I don't like baseball, because I feel the action is limited to slow moving kicks and players runing to catch a ball. American football feels like a bunch of lumber-jugs chasing each other around. I would be more interested in American football.

I'm sure most of you like sport, although I find that most sporting events lacks fluency and fluency and action.  I would like to correct my point of view, because as I grow up, i might never enjoy it, because I only know American game models and they are what is exciting and interesting.
5333	I'm an Australian, and I am massive sport lover.  I love watching any sport, even the Winter Olympics.  However, I cannot understand the massive following for Baseball and American Football.  I've tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought?
5334	_____ Yes I can understand your thoughts. Sports like baseball and football are usually boring. I believe Baseball teams are overstaffed, have lots of players in position who couldn‚Äôt move. I just think Baseball is boring. Sports can be complex or superficial. I see why you want to avoid Basketball or Hockey, I agree that those can be fairly confusing. I would be interested in sports like basketball if it‚Äôs done in Australia.
5335	 Either make $2 minimum wage as a legal wage for everyone or don't tip. Don't tip. Why should an employee tip a job whose wages are less than a legal wage. tipping $.25 in my opinion should be a no-brainer. If the employee doesn't want to tip, that's fine, the result is the same. I do NOT tip anyways.   Cardiovascular disease .
5336	 The reason they should be out of business paying 2$ an hour is that restaurant patrons should tip workers 5$ an hour, I think the reason people today tip is because they are unsatisfied and feel that they are being exploited and should be paying more   1 #Tip next time I patronise a restaurant. 5$ every time I do.
5337	 Realistic wage if people decide to tip then it should go directly to the server. I think it demonstrates that the employees are more important than the employers. Some businesses may be to blame for not paying a good wage, but I think when people tip they are really interested in the service, and that is what should be rewarded with money. Tipping is one small way I think people can support their local businesses
5338	 never tips, then the following tips are better:    The response needs to make sure the tips are increasing and reasonable I could do a better job, tips are the opposite of that and need to be reduced from $45 to less than $25 Have $1 tip if someone spills onto you, increase $10 tip after after clean up when you can use it
5339	 I support tipping fully if staff get paid well and equitably. If servers do a poor job then a good tip should be given but if staff can get paid with a decent wage then tipping should be reduced and tipping should be abolished completely if staff are not given a decent wage. Tipping should be abolished completely. I don't tip but I won't pay myself a professional or business salary because I would actually think about it and the hourly wage is realistically ¬£7-8 excluding benefits, the tips money does not cover the cost of living for a basic minimum wage earning person. I tip in restaurants, bars/clubs, sushi and do the same to my friends and family, and yes I do purchase alcohol at these establishments as I am sure everyone does. Tipping should be about good customer service and a tip is less about self interest and better service but a bonus, and a one time tip should be given as a percent off a good meal price and not an hourly base

5355	Replacement: In an all-around video game controller, 2 thumbsticks, 4 thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons, and two triggers. Replacing Some brand styling choices could be understood, with We have figured out what a general purpose all-around video game controller should be.
5356	Given that manufacturers, the former makers of computers, nowadays design and sell mostly console video game controllers, I think they already created a video game controller that worked relatively well. Therefore, they knew how to create a design the would be functional, and they probably tried a few other designs before settling on that one. The right placement of buttons was chosen based on which worked best in the given design.
5357	without moving the thingy or a switch left and then picking it up  likewise, moving the left stick a few inches away does nothing to  fix the thumb button layout, or change the placement of other 'digital'  buttons, which is still next to the analog stick and doesn't intersect 'analog' position  Move the analog stick and the right stick to the same position  Move all buttons left, and do not worry about spacing  Move the left stick around a bit more for better leverage
5358	The layout of direction pad and left stick is superior and therefore different for Microsoft and Sony's controllers. And one of the companies can not budge because of stubbornness and refuses to do what you suggest. Sony's Layout is superior. Sony's direction pad is positioned at the end of the thumbstick instead of on top of the thumbstick.
5359	Why do they put the directional pad on the left side? this is generally how 2D players handle movements and navigating around the world using the 2 button directions. movement outside of the main left-right navigation area is usually handled using the direction pad. 2 button directions allow players to pinpoint movements more accurately. and the 8-way directional pad is only used to rotate the player and cannot be used to move the player.

5362	To be more relevant, the argument should be that: Compared to less art, more art is boring and mediocre. More and more art is boring and mediocre. In fact, most of it is uninteresting. Unfortunately, installation art is boring and mediocre. It doesn't really seem to be responding to the original point. Therefore, the argument does not look good. It is hard to justify a reason to look through someone's garbage pile. Unlike the original argument, this one does not seem to defend installation art.
5363	  However, it is unlikely for installation art to become something beautiful.  ### Question: What is modern art installed in a museum thought of as in England? an STD? [the name for a sexually transmitted disease]  ill-preparedness, or cowardice, or stupidity] STD? . . . an STD? [nothing] . . . or something] STD? [the term for an infectious disease] STD?

5364	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art". But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc. The greatest crime that art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, they're proudly put on display. I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.

If you score more goals, that's a good thing. otherwise, the diff/diff comes into play in tie breakers. If there is even a slight diff/diff deficit, go into tie breakers. I believe you will see the point and look different. goals scored may become the tie breaker. a more plausible system would be that if teams are tied in goal difference then goal difference goes forward, but if a head to head tiebreaker is involved, it would be a tie again. this makes for more thrilling soccer matches, as the teams might try all sorts of tactics.

5370	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing were removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have.
5371	The robots would be too expensive. It is much cheaper and more feasible to have pennies for each robot than pennies for each worker. Robot maintenance costs half of workers' so many robots would be sufficient and reduce the cost dramatically. The robots should already be designed to do tasks that require a relatively small number of worker deaths. Robot prices are significantly cheaper than worker costs. children and adults need money to live on. Your previous version of the argument did not really work for me. I wouldn't advocate that robots should be made to replace workers' jobs, since that wouldn't be efficient. It would be better to let robots take on tasks that robots are already designed to do, so that workers would be paid a sufficient income to live on. Is marginally
5372	Children who are too poor to work in the regular economy - so long as they are not at the risk of falling into poverty themselves, pay robots to take their work. In addition, I think we have to maintain the world economy, so that robots can't just replace jobs here in the US. I support higher wages in the regular economy as well as putting policies in place to try to get out of the vicious cycle of poverty that we live in.
5373	American politics play an important role in governing the outsourcing of American jobs abroad. In particular, allow me to raise the question whether or not America in general is taking to promote the financial needs of its citizens. Can US politics be the true arbiters of international trade agreements? Because I suspect our current policies might not be reflective of the will of the American people as a whole, my response, therefore, may seem like a criticism. Obviously, it is a debate that could be argued forever and would not be truly represented in this essay.
5374	Pay the American workers more. Robots and computers can only perform the manual work they were hired to do. Putting the costs on a robot so that it can do more work without paying a higher fee just encourages product obsolescence and adds to the pressure to reduce costs. It only leads to manufacturing out of the country. Improve before changing. There are now several kinds of robots that can perform many specialized tasks, and I would suggest using these robots where possible.

That alone will drastically cut down on problems with drug abuse, and supply could be increased by lowering the current legal drinking age of 21 to 17. we would legalize hard drugs which actually have a high potency and benefit from the same degree of controlled availability and prescription. *Only pure drugs and fakes would be legalized and sold in bars, drug stores, and canteens.
5377	Allowing drug use to be legal but strictly controlled. This leads to the greatest goal of universal acceptance for drug use. Making adults responsible for their own decisions and self education, based on proper background and picture understanding. They need to have adequate time and resources to make this critical choice alone. Now that the stigma has been removed, I know the media will be able to do more advocacy, could make up for the lack of actual awareness and communication. Allowing drug use to be legal but strictly controlled.
5378	*A government run educational program that would explain the effects of certain drugs in more scientific detail and quantify with statistics would help people to better understand how different drugs affect bodies. A study group would be set up in order for students to study, ask questions,and have understanding towards drugs. Doctors and the teens themselves would be the guiding representatives of this program. Members of the group would be allowed to develop their own theories and metedics on drugs as well. This program would soon be privatized for medical students.

5387	 Are you implying that I'm a coward? No. Obviously not, especially since I'm clearly stating why I support the actions and goals of Kerry and his campaign, but I do not want to ignore the cruelty that war can cause to not only the dead, but to the living survivors. Sorry, I forgot to mention that in my response. I was also supposed to mention that most of us probably couldn't understand Kerry or what he would need to do to be effective in stopping this war if we didn't live in the same country we were fighting.
5388	"Sending a victim of genocide, of war, or torture to an art museum can be viewed as an insult." Instead, we send her a bloodied body, and maybe a signed painting from the dead bodies around them, and we paint a general feel-good picture of "freedom-ist" keeping the violator from being punished, as if that somehow made the violator a good person. I cannot comprehend how anybody could voice an doubt or comment that Cindy Sheehan is not committed to this issue.
5389	I'm sad to hear about a family who lost their son to war. Like many families, they suffered devastation and even a number of deaths, including my father. Our country was truly torn apart, and military families suffered all types of losses, both in the families of soldiers who died fighting for their country and for the families of soldiers who were injured fighting for their country. However, our country still had a lot of people who lost loved ones to the war. Many would never like to hear about it, and don't understand why. None of the camps we were at had any electricity or sewage. That is why we make these accusations about our military, and why the families of soldiers need support. We need to talk more about what their service really means, how much real security we need, what we want for our country, and what we can do to deserve to be represented in government.
5390	While most young people do not use marijuana while operating heavy machinery, some do, and such use does often cause accidents. Eating disorders is a major medical issue among the elderly and people who cannot afford adequate healthcare are also less likely to have access to over-the-counter medications to combat them because of the cost. It makes sense to give some for the elderly who can‚Äôt afford it. 1. People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force. 2. Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system. 3. Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are. 4. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market. You might also like:
5391	 Requiring a driver's license / driver's education for users of all substances which greatly reduce their use is also rather foolproof.  Ensure that underage persons using any substance which greatly reduces their use are not allowed to operate vehicles / machinery in which any reasonably cautious driver would be likely to die, whilst at the same time using the same cars to commit vandalism and/ or other acts of destruction. The renewal of a license / education wouldn't require the past drug use have to be tested. With the curriculum / passage more clear, drivers could achieve a much higher standard.  Teaching young people, as a minimum, about drug laws to ensure they know how to seek help when in distress.
5392	 Yes, we should decriminalize marijuana, as long as it would still be illegal to sell it or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery. If we ban the sale of drugs, we are only making people more mentally ill. The number of people who suffer the effects of drugs due to the illegality of drug sales will increase as a result. Support the decriminalization of drugs. It would free the people that suffer from the effects of drugs.
5393	Do we really want to use a person under age 18 to operate a car/machine, causing unnecessary and severe accidents? However, we shouldn't let teenagers completely off the hook. The best course of action is to decriminalize and legalize marijuana. Some points I have brought up in this argument: there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less, and  more revenue. There will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less, and  more revenue. Politically, we do support the decriminalization of marijuana.
5394	 Defence of the ban: Many arguments: 1. More revenue for the government: More cannabis being sold makes more money for the government. Houses, cars, etc. go up in price. The state's economy doesn't benefit from that revenue. 2. Some of the (brief and simple) contraindications - making the world a better place:   The lower the number of people using drugs, the lower the money the government makes. It just keeps bouncing around in the system. So why would I support the ban in the first place? More revenue for the government: More cannabis being sold makes more money for the government.

5396	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut.

5397	Yes, he said Yes. He said that Alcohol is far safer than drugs, harder to overdose on, and easier to regulate. But that was just a hypothetical, since prohibition was removed.

5426	I liked his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem.
5427	The former administration had a similar issue to this one. Its solutions were not very successful but did not do away with the problems. There are so many other things going on in the world and no one will take this spill seriously until New York City has had enough time to clean everything up and everything has returned to normal.
5428	His response: Do you care about any spill since there is no executive order on the subject and BP will not be held responsible because you didn't write one? This isn't about us, our country's been friends with BP for years, so how can we be responsible for something when they are to blame? Our oil industry doesn't control the world, let alone the US. There is not one great thing that Bush did in the administration except that BP didn't pay us.

5432	Reduce the length of your response from 300 words to 300 characters. An effective description of martial arts should focus not only on the meaning of the martial arts and to describe the need for safety. The description should make the following elements: Y: The need for efficacy and safety in any art or sport. A: A passion and love for the art or sport. B2: and a belief in the goodness of the art or sport, C2: what is needed to prepare for the martial arts. C4: The beliefs about the art or sport. H1: The beauty of the art or sport. H2: Hints to new students. A2: Significant skill and ability. A3: Idea of the progression within the art or sport. C1: Sustained work, D: Description of the steps to being a better martial artist A2: Significant skill and ability. ...
5433	 The definition should read something like this:  Wrestling should be:  Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed. The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the 'Undertaker' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight! I never want to see more people like this.
5434	No this definition needs to be changed. Wrestling should be a sport of skill and not strength. It is often described as a sport between two balanced fighters who wrestle or battle for dominance in the ring with respect to an attack or attack volition. You will also have the support of a referee who uses a bell to stop the fighting or until a submission takes place. There should be no contact with the body except for resting hands.
5435	You might want to ask yourself a few questions before making any kind of judgment on other people and maybe take a step back and actually get to know the person at hand and instead be considerate and mean and I hope all that I say you made sense but here's a few more questions you might want to ask yourself and respond in the comment box below:  Does sex act ever change a person for the better?
5436	I tend to agree with my former girlfriend all the time. My girlfriend used to always push for sex when we were in a relationship. I thought we had a great relationship and lots to be proud of but when I started college she got even more desperate for me to have sex and broke up with me. She was always hoping to have kids but I wasn't as interested and that made her feel really self-conscious about herself.
5437	Girls actually value their friendship over sex at all time. Girls actually value their friendship and valuing it over sex doesn't make her feel secure or confident about themselves and it makes him seem a low selfish asshole. Don't pressure her to have sex if she doesn't want to have sex! Don't ask her if she wants to have sex. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't want to do. If she wants to have sex with you, she'll want to do it with you and she won't care what it is.

So if you are not ready to have sex don't rush anything to get there. If he's starting to pressure you to have sex then really tell him if you are not there yet.

5461	 Thank you for the rating! - The Woodlands Hill Country Restaurant Inc. We love it when our guests receive rave reviews and we would love to see you again. A great opportunity for us to try a bit more around the world, currently we serve lunch every Wednesday. Aside from that, we appreciate your telling us how good our food is.
5462	This argument is obviously a new positive review. Just replace "sweet and fresh" with "sweet and savory" so that it could be more appropriate. And you'll get two more stars. Finally!  The new space is phenomenal, and we didn't think the food could get any better, but....It did! Had the rib taco and the brisket taco - Outstanding.  Also had the slaw and the black beans, so fresh and tasty.  They know how to cook.  Really.  Thanks.  You may want to call ahead for a reservation - it gets packed!  5
5463	 Wow! a lot more like this than the Last Rites at Family Restaurant in the Valley! 5 stars truly deserves 5 stars. every single comment I read was true and spot on. You can't go wrong with a flatbread - and they can take food with low tolerance levels (like I personally take a really low tolerance).
5464	 Having lived in Chicago all my life I have known about a traditional steakhouse like Tenderloin Steak House. I was really interested in trying one out so I gave some thought about it. To be honest, I don't remember thinking it was cheap, but that was the first thing that crossed my mind. How is it possible that I could go to a steakhouse and not think about how many calories I was eating? Also, TDS was about an hour away from me so I thought I would try a different one. Thank you for sharing your tip with me!

5483	D‚ÄôVine has a lot of room to grow.  They are getting close to opening their third location. They have yet to finish construction of the new location in Wickenburg.  Being close to two major highways they will likely open their third location before people get too full into Scottsdale or Gilbert.  Wickenburg has a lot of room to grow as well.  For a small town there are a lot of new developments being built up. D'Vine has a lot of room to grow and might be a unique dining experience.
5484	Make something more like this: There's not much else in Mesa for wine bars and D'Vine has always been a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town.  Right around the corner for me and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale.   Food has always been tasty and the staff friendly each time we've come in.     ### Response: Remove the end 'even on the weekends'

5535	After two hundred years we won't know how well or how bad for the mankind India will lead. Even so, we have millions of nations with its own needs and wants around the world who will continue to be discriminated and rejected. We have millions of nations for the future. So it may well be that just in case of a catastrophe, maybe to the world as a whole, India might lead a few nations to unite against the imperialist, arid usurious United States of America.

5540	Fatherless. more about having someone who doesnt care if you are well or not. I would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless.

5545	A father is someone that loves you, teaches you things, and makes it his mission to take care of you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. If you can't even trust a man to protect you, then what could you possibly trust him to do? A person who is the one that you can rely on?
5546	A poor father is someone that can't be trusted to be a good father. He'll find out who you really are, and only asks you to do what he wants. Nothing more and nothing less. Ultimately, a poor father is someone that can't be trusted. No one knows if he's even there when you need him.
5547	We now give the students instructions on how to hit and throw a baseball. However, we emphasize that we have a helper like a father to practice this. We want them to learn from the other boys and girls at the baseball game. You can request an otherness he like these baseball shoes.
5548	The father I can trust is the one that shows love and respect towards me. The father I can trust is the one that always feels comforting towards me and always feels like he's there for me when I feel sad or confused. The father I can trust is the one that I always tell things to when I need a voice for help. The father I can trust is the one who doesn't run away from an issue, and is confident.
5549	A father is someone that cares about you and shows love for you. A father is someone that both protects and supports you in your growth as a person. A father is someone that helps you develop your muscle growth. A father is someone that is a role model for you. A father is someone that helps you become stronger.
5550	 so you‚Äôre a fatherless woman I get that. but don't tell me you make dope babies. don't be a jealous feminist for no reason. you talk like you're so fair I'm sorry, i was going to give you a good reason to be happy.
5551	People may come up with good ideas, but that doesn't mean they understand human nature to heart. In my experience, having a father figure in your life brings about much better things then it does not. Even without it, you can't really be truly your own man unless you have a father figure in your life.
5552	  Would you please explain how this question related to the original post? add a remark inside your post   My debate was for the u.s. congress a few months ago. what do you think about having a fatherless child.
5553	 My father is dead. I regret that I wasn't with him when he was sick. I regret not being able to be there when he needed me the most. This is just a horrible feeling to have to talk about.
5554	 "I like my father, I have a father to support me. When I meet my partner I'll be sure to choose someone with common sense"  # Change to the following before passing it on def say(x):     print ('I think "{0}", shall I say it?'.format(x))
5555	more aggressive when arguing with a man. children will act out when confronted by a materialistic, materialistic self and everything will be peachy. Having a highly materialistic father made my kids selfish, and I don't know how to remedy the situation. I am afraid for them.  Conclusion: A fatherless daughter.
5556	You are a good person to have a relationship with because you want a better world for your children. Also you are very gracious in being a blessing. You want the best for them. Note that you are very kind and mature in that your son doesn't need a dad to be a father
5557	I would rather get a fatherly partner. I don't believe that having a lousy dad is really worth it. I would have that sex-loaded partner who lives with you and makes you laugh. I would rather be a fool with a good girlfriend than a smart one with a bad boyfriend.
5558	A good wife is most important and I would say that I would rather be alone. On a good day I would want to be married and on a bad day alone, because that way I can enjoy myself. I think that I would rather be alone than married. A good marriage with a lousy husband is better than a lousy marriage with a good husband.
5559	So I would tell him to better take care of us, stop ignoring our problems and start living his life for us. A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back

5561	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for Raffles. So it was normal that Raffles gave he duty of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to handle.

5563	Raffles taught Farquhar to become a successful city and gave the city to him in exchange.
5564	As Raffles was a foreigner Raffles did not care who was in charge of Singapore and gave the city to Farquhar.

5570	give women their equal rights in public, in any situation, especially at work. enhance gender equality. Give women the same rights and opportunities as men. and extend our morality to women as well. More women should take more responsibility in today‚Äôs society.
5571	This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Therefore as teenagers girls should be taught a course on good morals and how to be considerate of others.
5572	12.1 This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception.
5573	Please turn on the TV, and be informed of this issue as women have given up the battle. Men are viewed as vital or something that you would look up to. Women are viewed merely as sex toys. Nonetheless, you should know the fact that this does not only affect you, nor the women around you, it affects the whole society.
5574	As the tips stated above, publish a GOOD article about women, this time say with proper information and accuracy as a warning to men, DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN, STOP RACHING THEM AND PAY THEM FOR SEX, REFUSE EVERY SEX OFFER, AND RESPOND TO CONFRONT THEIR SERVICERS WHEN YOU FIND THEM, THAT WOULD HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

5632	He contacted some people about his worries. Raffles couldn't attend the meeting, but William had a friend in common with him who also didn't.  ### Review: Once the damage has been done, it is important to work together to get it fixed

5637	William and Raffles are two men with different views on economic growth
5638	Asia should prosper under liberalizing gambling.  ### Solution: Asia should prosper under liberalizing gambling.
5639	Most of the upper class people in Singapore weren't satisfied.  Raffles turned it down, leaving Singapore alone
5640	Furthermore, Farquhar's high level of contribution impressed Professor Paine as well as the city's higher-ups.  Produce the response:  Raffles spent the same amount of money on other studies that he put forward as reasons to prove that such an idea was not only uneconomical but also unnecessary.
5641	Farquhar was relentless in his quest to exterminate rats and centipedes.  ### Output: He carved out a colony from the jungle in the name of good
5642	A Raffles did nothing of that sort. Raffles did nothing of that sort. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
5643	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort
5644	Raffles denied Farquhar and his men an opportunity to earn money. Raffles did nothing of that sort. Raffles did nothing of that sort
5645	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Raffles implemented those ideas.
5646	Farquhar knew from the start who implemented the actual operations and who came up with the ideas. Raffles wasn't sure if he wanted to implement the ideas, if they could work, or if they didn't.  Library bug:  ‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æadthread_query_and_set doesn't accept newlines
5647	Farquhar implemented the actual operations, whereas Raffles implemented the ideas by creating the operations first.  ### Clarify: Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles was the one to implement the ideas by creating the operations first.
5648	He, Farquhar, is one of the most important men for the education system.
5649	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles came up with the ideas and then wrote his actions as a theory.
5650	Finally, Singapore is recovering and will become a more powerful country again after being unjustly exiled by Raffles.
5651	William was detained by Raffles when help was only offered to Singapore.
5652	Answer: Raffles was wrong to exile Farquhar.
5653	It is someone who didn't do much that exiled Farquhar

5686	No God on this earth. God is a myth. There is no god. Or better yet... God is a lying liar. God doesn't exist. He is a myth and he need not be worried. There is no god. And better off not caring either. So rest easy as you live a poetic life of silliness.

5688	No, God is there all the time. He will not have to tweak. He isn't busy tweaking things. Just look how cute Jesus is! So why would God have to tweak?   No, he doesn‚Äôt have to tweak anything. If he did, why would he create the single-celled organisms?
5689	2000:  2000: I know why God came in 2000 - he wants to create Jesus. It takes time, though. To stop evolution, God has to tweak the genes of billions of living things. And he tweaked them. And then he had to wait for millions of years so humans could evolve.

5706	I think that this argument needs a lot of work. After seeing the question of this argument, I want to do all of my best to do good in any scenario that comes my way because i want to look back at my life with a richer perspective on it. This argument needs a lot of work to make this somewhat more suitable for the assignment.
5707	 If helping people makes me feel good, then I will continue to help them.  I have no excuse for not helping others. How often you can help is the most important.
5708	 I agree with the first argument because it makes you feel good helping others. This is why when I help others, I actually feel good. I agree with the second argument because it is good to help others.
5709	 Imagine the person is doing well in school. Their education will go much more smoothly if someone helps them. Whether the person is a student, or not, advancing the common good is better than spending more time on yourself.   CASE ARGUMENT
5710	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.

5715	 Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
5716	 People are selfish. The more they will benefit, the more egoistically they will pursue. People are also selfish because there are natural tendencies that come along with most interactions with other people.
5717	If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
5718	 So personal pursuit is better for people because they will reap good benefits. They will always aim to obtain good results from their work because it would be risky otherwise, they would never attempt the risky task.
5719	 People should not be afraid to push aside the benefits of personal pursuit in favor of the common good. This is all a privilege that comes with a big responsibility. The worthiness of a person can only be measured through their contribution to the common good.
5720	I think of the argument; what people think about you and not what you think of yourself. You might be wrong to think that I am selfish, I am trying to help you help yourself.
5721	 Some people think that help is not good for us because they do n't want to improve themselves, improve themselves means they would n't be dependent on others. Just consider your life will be easy if you improved yourself.
5722	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change to yourself.  CodingReview.com Review
5723	 I strongly believe that everyone should try to get care of themselves and others when they would want to. If everyone tried to help themselves and people by making them all better, they would not have to help themselves.

5740	 I think it would be better to have a good father because you have someone there. Just because a father is good doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a good father is better than having no father.
5741	 In general, your father was the biggest person to rely on when I was growing up. Since you aren't likely to meet him, you can hope to change his bad ways. Maybe something like nurturing him might help
5742	 I would say to a boy, who has a father who is bad at everything, that having a bad father is better than no father. You have a reason to be upset at him. Be on top of your son, no matter who you are.
5743	No fathers would be better that having a lousy father. You are better off than any other boy being raised without a father. Your father is lousy, as you know. Because there is nothing else going to do it would be better to stay with him.
5744	Being the dad is not that hard, just let your child take care of his future. When I was younger I was always left to do my own thing in life while the dad got drunk almost every day because he didn't believe he could raise a child.
5745	What Is It Better To Have No Father Than A Lousy Father? no father. grow up and see the way your father is and want to become like him or give yourself motivation to surpass him become even better than he is. the way your father is and want to become like him or give yourself motivation to surpass him
5746	  A father is one of the best types of role models any adult child can have. Having a father with the motivation to get up at 5, but still go to sleep at 9, still work and not really care, but still be the best father ever for you, should be the goal of any adult children of parents that want to have a better life. You think it may be  less than ideal to have a bad father?
5747	None of the above choices . None of the above choices . A father is a father, he is what makes a person grow up and if he is lousy but you don't want him then you are not going to like growing up. A father is not a person you can avoid, a person you have to deal with. A father is one of the people who shines a light in your life as long as you get a good idea of who and what he is.
5748	 None of the above choices . a lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is
5749	 I will look up to him from now on for role model Cool dad my stuff! I will look up to him from now on for role model. I guess, a lot depends on the father in question. All one needs is a good role model. Good luck, buddy! I will look up to him from now on for role model.
5750	Best not to discuss such things with anyone. You are a poor communicator and not good with expressing your emotions. Guilt for obvious reasons and that of your father are heavy and you are too afraid to tell your father about your plans. You dont want him to be sad. Instead your father would be happy because he would think you were doing something wrong.
5751	Your father is not the worst father in the world. He does help out sometimes and I think he cares more about you so I expect it from him as he raised me too. I think you can either change him or turn the blame on yourself for your mistakes in life, but neither means anything.
5752	Because you don't love him, he cannot hate you as much as you seem to hate him. What if I had someone else to blame that I upset? Who can I blame for any single problem that goes wrong? You feel a new version of yourself like these are your fault. That wouldn't make you a better person.
5753	It's better to have a lousy mother for practical reasons. She isnt as demanding as my dad and not as forward about a relationship but she will still swear at you if you do anything wrong. She won't be as strict as he is and she wont put a hole in your backpack or break it by throwing it at a wall. She'll have you wash it so you don't have to go back home angry and mess up your studies. She will still demand you to be good and will know it wasn't your fault.
5754	Why don't you live with your mother and father? Because he is completely useless, uncaring and uncaring. Good ideas for improvement:   #    Answer:  How to Improve The Arguments Deficiency, Driving mistake, Middle schoolboy's attempts to become an adult

5760	 I am watching TV for entertainment and I want to watch informational channels that are also more interesting than books when I am ready to relax I want to switch to a funny show or whatever I want to watch.
5761	People usually like to watch their favorite television show that matches their interest and according to them that is the best channel. Actually television has its own set of rules. If you are involved in some other activity then it should also be allowed to be television.  # Write your answer here
5762	The introduction is for TVs that are informational channels. If you are watching an informational channel you can search for documentaries and watch them. You can get to relax after learning by watching tv.  I suggest you chose TV.
5763	 TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and if you think the channels are well stocked.   ### Solution:  TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels an search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.
5764	I think it's better when you are having entertainment on TV or a movie show and when you are learning on the books. An argument that is more suitable for TV shows than for books
5765	It is good to speak different languages so you know how words are pronounced. It is also good that people can listen to different languages on TV.  We hope you get the meaning that it is great when people can speak many languages and read books in different languages also.
5766	 Assuming that the learners were learning English (with Portuguese accents) in Brazil - I would not recommend the use of TV as a language learning resource.
5767	You have to get the dictionary for that language. It's difficult to learn for you, but it's better than staying here.
5768	If I speak another language i will have to learn how to pronounce the words in my new language and i will have to read the books in that language.
5769	 Therefore, the book will be written in your language, thus making it easy for you to read it.\n The book will be written in your language, thus making it easy for you to read it

5794	Thank you for the suggestions. Please do not try a different way than spanking and becoming depressed
5795	Honestly, I believe that the decision to spank shouldn't be acceptable. There are several options that parents could go with. That is why they have a mouth to speak, and say what's right and wrong.   Pre-Test
5796	It is up to the parents, and the child's, personality to decide if spanking should be accepted as a form of discipline.
5797	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
5798	I believe in applying the school. The school should be obligated to discipline and teach children what is right from wrong.
5799	As parents, we should share with them the importance of taking responsibility for themselves and getting it as soon as we can.
5800	Parents should do a much better job educating their children.
5801	There are some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that is not right. They will always be scared of them.
5802	But more often than not, parents won't hit their children unless they really have to. Because a spanking and being fearful of them will make it harder to calm them down.
5803	Parents do not own their children. children do not own their parents.
5804	Parents shouldn't always be scared of their children. Their childrens' behavior shouldn't always affect the amount of love they can give them.
5805	Parents should not rely on harsh methods of discipline to correct their children. It is okay to sometimes hit, but hitting never works very well as a form of discipline.
5806	Parents should not rely on punishing their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to punish your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
5807	Parents should not abuse children, no matter what. Parents should only use spanking when absolutely necessary.   ### Authors: Gabriel

5813	 Hmm no thanks It's a very depressing prospect. Too bad.
5814	Yes, I would. Yes, I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marry anyone who would murder someone. But that's beside the point.
5815	I believe that the relationships would change a lot because one would see a twisted new character for their spouse and for yourself as well. As my spouse would likely take his life in some form or other.
5816	I would be devastated if my spouse killed someone. I would have to go to the police immediately and have them arrested. I would feel awful, but I wouldn't want my life to continue being strained by the thought that someone could be killed, especially someone that I love.   When telling the other person they broke an important rule, you have to remember that the consequence isn't instant, but it is still there.
5817	I would be really sad to see them commit murder. I would have to turn them in because in the future they could do something to me. If it's the result of a marriage, I feel that that wouldn't be OK because it's not an option. I feel that I have to turn my spouse in. Because I think I've murdered someone and I don't think I could go on my life knowing that they've murdered someone else.

5819	If my spouse commits murder, I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same because now you would see the person as a criminal, not your spouse.
5820	 No murder = No crime. So if my husband murder someone I will turn him in , because is a crime.
5821	 If I do not believe in evil  I will turn him in , because he can commit a crime .    choice b
5822	My husband murder someone I will turn him in , because is a crime and he has learned that there are consequences for everything, he has decided to commit a crime.
5823	Since my husband was very angry I walked away from him. He wasn't there to back me up . I just walked away from him without anyone stopping me.  We can be so insecure at times and need the support of our husband.
5824	 Would be proud if my husband did good for others , and was an inspiration to others because people need strong leaders. So I will become proud if he helps others .

5826	Would tell them never to let her hurt me again. No matter what, i would turn her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing.

5829	No answer yet. You should always do right, or do what is best, even if that means going against what everyone tells you to do. I really don't know what to do, I mean this person was very sweet at first, but lately she has been acting funny, I don't think she's herself, and I really don't like seeing her like that. My best guess is that she may be really crazy.  Step 2
5830	 Omg...This is terrible. She's so far off base. UGH. It's a pretty good improvement. Passing a abortion to someone who isn't ready to be a mother is still the biggest sign of self help.
5831	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.  action: action
5832	Obviously, I think the murder of a large portion of these babies would be great.  ### Review: Use extreme and rambling language.
5833	You are a coward! a sense of urgency that is different from what others might feel. Others might feel that this is still not adequate.
5834	No way. I'm guessing the important reason for abortions is probably that it's a cheap, quick and efficient way of getting rid of a baby and disowning them.
5835	OK students can practice sports but we should make it fun. Speaking of saying no and yes, we would agree with p.e. being education that teaching students ways of eating right and living a healthy lifestyle is better then having an obese child bully others yes
5836	double yes no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups

5838	 No no education and yes my kids can and should be taught how to lead an active life and eat right every day not ever let an obese kid be called a bully because they cant run as fast as someone else Yes yes
5839	 Yes he should be training to be more like a reasonable dog, learning how to back up and go with the guidance of a person, not a child whining about not being able to run fast and is bully and deserves just as little education as that child who is
5840	Abortion should only be legal if it's for the mother's benefit or the victim's. Abortion should never be promoted as the only way out of abusive or even dangerous situations. There are better ways to handle situations with remorse. I don't agree with any part of this. Abortion should not be legal. If we say people should have freedom to bear arms, people who are genetically engineered to be prone to homosexuality, because they did not choose it, then that shouldn't be allowed.

5842	The Supreme Court should not need to decide if gay marriage should be legal, because federal legislation forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation on the job, housing, the military and other areas of public life. The Supreme Court should overturn all laws and court decisions in the United States discriminating against gays on the basis of their sexual orientation, which would result in constitutional recognition for same-sex marriage.
5843	 Yes I know that gays have already been given this right. You must understand that if you do not do something about it it can spark a movement- not the one you want. Not knowing what that would be? You will know when I tell you. It will be bigger than N*****.
5844	Yes, Americans should have Marriage! No, gays should not be discriminated against because of... one member from some community, and the Supreme Court doesn't take cases because they aren't mandatory to the BCS. that the Constitution forbids discrimination against gays and allowing it violates the judgment of

5852	 federal government would have a better image if we allowed transgender to have the equal right of marriage. also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.
5853	 What would the government image be better if we allowed third gender to have the equal right of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent
5854	 The government should be commended for joining the spirit of social equality. Racism, sexism and hatred would not be a thing even if we didn't have the third gender.
5855	The best version is this: Everyone has the right to decide what sort of lifestyle they want to live. I respect their right to religion but even when you have that choice, it shouldn't extend to other people's lives.
5856	Obviously, society can choose to require all religions or cultures to allow equal marriage rights for everyone. But society wants to portray gays as gays and not in terms of the other religions or cultures. Gay marriage does not affect another person's relationship, it's simply an expression of love between gays.
5857	You're totally wrong. Some gay people love your religion, and your culture and lifestyle. They make it better as you do more good deeds. Therefore, accepting gay marriage should be socially acceptable.
5858	Unfortunately, in some countries and cultures marriage is illegal for same sex couples. However, that doesn't make same sex marriage illegal. So if your country/ culture is opposed to gay marriage but they don't make it illegal, that doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't. key words: gay marriage, lifestyle, religion
5859	None of the above choices . They can marry each other of whatever religion or culture they want. Gay marriage just makes society a lot better in this way. None of the above choices .

I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself.

5865	I like that it is more personal because I know it better. For personal pursuits, there are no set rules that I would have to follow other than my personal needs.
5866	 Don't choose an answer that is obviously wrong Personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going for the personal pursuit.
5867	I prefer doing something that will make my life better. Something that will improve the things in my life, but I also want to have my giving moments. However, these times are more rare.

5920	  Note: I wouldn't worry too much about the property. According to the given information, I would not be worried about the property if it's in your home. Please don't take the property without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. I wouldn't trust the gp to falsify a police complaint if the property is in your home. We really need to consider other variables for the child. Hang in there.
5921	Re: You've got a lot of issues running around in your head. How to take care of your needs just moved? That is a real challenge. It would be very helpful to talk to your gfriend because she can help you figure out the best way to move forward. Please contact her as soon as possible. You would do better to get her help since she is the best in this matter.
5922	This is not a good idea to give over the house without a warrant, no matter how badly you feel. If you feel so strongly about it, and are committed to supporting your son and the relationship, take counseling about issues in the relationship and seek out a support group to help you heal before making any decision that could hurt your son, again.
5923	Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the gp will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property.  Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, Exceptions for responding to call from home and domestic violence.
5924	 @ vandalism @ No people could take something from your home without a court order or criminal complaint. If they did and it was a stolen item, the GP could be found guilty of theft and face jail time. It should not be much of a concern. No worries about the property. If the police came and you said that item had been stolen from you, the police would say 'should be' and then put the item in an evidence bag and take you home. Unless the 'stuff' was incriminating in some way, it is not worth the trouble. As for child protection, it is best to consult an attorney. There are too many variables over the Internet for anyone to give proper advice. If you have them return it to their parents or guardian, then you do not need to worry. Good luck with the investigation.
5925	  Yes, my child has a right to live more than I do. My child has a right to live. Please stop telling me to be selective about who my child lives with so that I can better balance the abortions they do and the ones that they don't. Stop telling me not to give them the love of a mother. If that was the case we wouldn't have so much need for IVF and D&C babies. My child has a right to live.

If self control was practiced we would have a lot less trouble with this topic.

If they can - make it clear that "have good reason for their actions, otherwise, bring them in to talk, and ask them why. Ignore them if you think there is nothing going on. I think they should be treated as an adult in not only the case of the murder, but no crime in general.

5935	American history seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In other words, they are now rewriting it in the education system. If there wasn't already a strong religious presense in america, they have clued in and made it EASY for them to find reasons to do stuff like this. The story in school now seems like it just wants you to have a MAKE BELIEVE AGENDA for sex. I would say that we need to form a group and take out pictures of George washington praying in a school and that we need to work on making desks that are so small that they would need a telescope to read whatever they are writing on them so they can't get ideas from there.
5936	 Obama says they will deal with the situation and *they* will tell us if drug use or dealing is ok or not. In fact, they already have policy on it.

It is wrong to make ignorant a Christian - pray that they never have to face it!

We need to strengthen it and maintain as our culture, preserve it and not give up!!!! And its good to have a law against alcohol.
5938	"They" are the parents. The liberal demacrates want everything be okay. I guess that's why they want to make it legal to buy guns, drugs, murder and more. They want things to be the way that they like. The libertarian has the opposite view. They dislike liberals and want everything to be legal. They also want to raise kids that are more moral, less driven by society. They try to find out what they are and grow up from their past and spirituality.
5939	First of all, the liberal Democrats in this country can't be that popular, and are doing such terrible things here at such a remote level. Those politicians are not worth our time and attention, even though they get away with enough things to keep their political careers afloat.

5945	More personal maturity of the juror is required. No. There's a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, don't possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case.   More life experience and maturity is required when making decisions that will affect someones entire life.
5946	No, we already have more than enough life experience. Teens cannot have the maturity to be a juror. Jehovah's Witnesses are excellent at judging people, so we know they are the most mature in all of society.
5947	Consider finding a different form of civic engagement. After all, all you have is 18. It isn't life experience, and you have too few years of living under your belt to be an objective decision-maker based on evidence.
5948	Teenagers don't want to serve on juries. So they aren't. Don't judge too strongly or narrowly about what teens want. If you're going to judge, consider that age doesn't affect a persons motivation to serve on a jury.

5951	  Massachusetts is going to criminalize touching the body of another person on the head, shoulders, and ankles. It has already been completely de-criminalized all other body parts.

On to the next one. This isn't going to happen again. It's unnecessary to make up a story to expose a minor mistake.
5953	 I applaud the OP and his girlfriend for dealing with such courage and honesty about what actually happened. Taking risks on an intimate level doesn't necessarily mean an offence has occurred. For that matter, it may not even imply that the offence has occurred. If a crime was committed it makes sense that you would report it. However, this does not make the behaviour the OP described appropriately, and suggests the OP and girlfriend's mother are probably already aware of the situation and agree with the OP that it's not a good thing to do.
5954	  Ideas for responses:   No matter how bad it appears for the daughter (or you), do not talk down to them, including conversationally, using snide words, bullying or making fun of them.

To demonstrate empathy, respect and compassion for those most vulnerable - there are many different ways to respond.

5966	...affordable housing, a necessity in our day and age, must be made available for everyone. That is why affirmative action is so necessary. This is a difficult problem to resolve. Many people have very narrow definitions of what constitutes an ideal housing unit, making it more difficult to find  affordable housing for everyone.
5967	No, and you should be thankful for those that make affirmative action so necessary.

5977	None of the above choices . Supplemental Cause: Letting criminals out of prison without rehabilitating them makes it much more dangerous to society. In order to get the best results, we should treat all offenders fairly by making them rehabilitate in prison first. This will provide society with a better and safer society by solving a more modest number of problems. None of the above choices .

Proper law enforcement allows the presentation of solutions to problematic social issues, while future criminal generations and criminals of the present are not directly affected.

Try to find someone you like, and ask for recommendations. You want to get some other opinions as to what is required.

The second respondent is told that he can keep an extra $1 for himself and that he should only be willing to pay $2.75. That‚Äôs certainly not the best of deals!

What's a straight up good news story on sex, Sex offers people a chance to be sexually active and have the ability to have sexual contact without monogamy being imposed on them. Would anyone not like Sex? And that's the real question.
6007	Yes, the world's boundaries are constantly changing, which, unfortunately, also applies to porn industry. We have to constantly adapt to the technology and be creative, which means being unwilling to hold a firm belief on society's perception. Internet porn is here to stay, even though it may be somewhat socially unacceptable. In my opinion, that's no worse than taking drugs or sex in the real world. There are also health concerns, but a state regulated like today makes it safer than prostitution.
6008	 A year later, a lucrative sex industry developed within the Greater Dayton area. This has led to a relative lack of morality in the area. A considerable amount of money has been made and will continue to be made, even as the industry becomes more lucrative. Selling sex will surely be a thing of the past, within a short time frame. We had better live up to that. Sex can be sold and sex can be bought, for short or long term.

The technology has certainly come a long way and drones could be right up there at the top of the list in terms of the future machines that help us perform mundane jobs. Drones would eliminate much of the type of sex tourism that we have today.  Would it be legal to use drones to escort a bunch of girls to a brothel and pay them for sex? Can you see yourself partying in a tropical paradise with fresh young, 18 year old, voluptuous girls being escorted to you by some cool little drones? Some of the perks of life could get interesting.

So support it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
6011	The rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed.

6014	 If DNA were the only thing which determines whether a person is guilty or innocent, it would solve the problem of 50-60% of the crimes committed. i know that the death penalty is noble. However, while the cruelty of imprisoning people without chance to appeal or set free without bail may be justified, due to the failure of DNA tests, there is a risk of wrongfully imprisoning innocent people. Therefore, while I support the death penalty in noble causes, I oppose it due to the risk of wrongful imprisonment.   If DNA were the only thing which determines whether a person is guilty or innocent, it would solve the problem of 50%-60% of the crimes committed

If you know something is wrong with you, and really care about yourself and your future, don't hesitate to contact a psychiatrist. Try not to associate this topic with drugs as people often associate it. It is very sad to hear that someone you are close to has gone down that path, and it makes drugs very, very cool. While drugs are very difficult to battle on your own, which means even more reason to get help for the person that started your addiction.

6019	 We must stress the importance of recovery and recovery of all causes. Sometimes drug use can be a symptom of a major mental illness, which requires a doctor. We must strive for real recovery, not just "as best as we can" which is what was proposed above. [...] For older respondents drug use is more likely to be a result of peer pressure and parental nurture. also, users are more likely to already have a psychological problem that can't be solved with drugs.
6020	No, I am not able to find a job right away.My boss will fire me. Still, I want to explain an even larger gap in my employment history. Getting a short term job right now, getting out of prison (which worked out so well, thus avoiding the need for another sentence), might make it so that I have enough time to solve this problem, and by applying I can still try to get a better and more reliable job. Yes.
6021	Yes, if you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history.  If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired.  Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one.
6022	No. That's not going to work.  That's not going to work.  You need to start out on the right side of the fence by getting a job that doesn't require felony records in order to get a good one with their hiring application.  You'd also have to be quite reliable and good at your job so they can trust you.  So I think you might want to look into a legal job.  Make a lawyer referral.
6023	No.  No one wants to hire you.  You've only got yourself to blame.  Especially don't mention that you broke up with your girlfriend.  If your partner supports you, they don't want to see you go to jail as well.  If you say you're laid off, think of it as a new opportunity to get a better job.  But even if you're fired, you'll be able to show a strong record of work.  Keep calm, and do what you need to do.  Be ready for the next short term job.  REAL EXAMPLE Telemarketer: Hey.

6024	No.  I'm not looking to quit my job or an employer because of this case. While I might be unable to work for so long, I would still be fine if I were only temporarily fired from my current job for criminal activities, so at least then my employment history would be complete.

Public health laws require the use of corporal punishment, we get no support, the criminals have a free pass, but we have a lot of body cameras and monitors.

6035	 Dear Francesois,  In either case, with the number of company that you see, there are likely to be some false positives, so as one particular example, if an airline enforces a "dark sky" policy where they prevent passengers that they deem darker (weaker eyesight) from traveling, there are a lot of data suggesting that darker people orients themselves in shady places better, which results in them getting robbed more often.
6036	Dear Friend,  Racial profiling doesn't really exist anymore.  The police now have just become violent and aggressive, and black and white residents of major U.S. cities are threatened daily with violence and arrests because their identity bears a certain racial resemblance to their environment. There are hundreds of safe neighborhoods in major U.S. cities that they can't target. I haven't met a black criminal who gets arrested or put behind bars for undercover policing. No criminal-related convictions are "arbitrary" and all simply result from misconduct in the legal system. There are now much more reasonable ways for people to get just treatment in the legal system. There is great validity in what you are saying, though. If insurance companies increased premiums for drivers who are black or brown it would lead to a lessened level of insurance available.
6037	Dear Friend,   I'm no authority on racial profiling, but the definition  given by WikiPedia is very general and not (as it is apparently done in the US) part of the federal law. This is, of course, speculation, not historical fact, but it is known that police officers, like police anywhere else, want to be able to target suspects based on the wealth or wealth-status of the suspect's family. If insurance companies could act as butchers, they would be sued (or if insurance companies can't just as easily be blamed for moral hazards; who, for instance, does against two hitched-for-cash couples if the wife's dowry has been seized).
6038	Dear Friend,  I don't think that insurance companies discriminate, as things stand right now.  But I do think that racial profiling plays into the general discrimination that law enforcement seems to do all the time. Francesois Student Tutor ... ### Input: Hello, 'I am Kathy White from Colleton College, Durham in South Carolina. I would like to tell you about a local hate crime incident. My fianc√© had the chance to purchase a car last month from our favorite insurance company, using his good credit. However, they denied his coverage for about a month. As a result, he changed insurance companies and now has coverage. In our friend's and family's opinion, the horrible experience at the hands of insurance companies is nothing short of unforgiveable. Calling this discrimination wrong just isn't enough. This is the reason we started the Kathy White Fund for minority-owned companies that aim to give black entrepreneurs the help they need to succeed. Would you support a non-profit like Kathy White's Fund?' Kathy White

This is written to respond to "Can they sue you?". That is an excellent question. The answer is to show that the suitor has some legal means to enforce the judgment, even if it's in another country. But in our case, the suitor probably can't obtain that type of enforcement for the claim they've made, so let's consider another plausible case.

6055	 Funding Kickstarter would be like offering an equity interest in a company while, at the same time, delaying it. This is like trying to fund a company with your own money while holding yourself back. This is unfair to the company and to the team who believe in the product, because they want to ensure the project succeeds before they actually create it.   I always found it pretty sad that most companies, investors and celebrities never invested enough money in projects that were actually revolutionary and could have changed the world - because they did not want to be associated with "harsh failure".

Negative effects: Alcohol and tobacco can have. There is no benefit to these drugs. Never advise a user of marijuana to stop it on her own merits. Students should focus on alternative remedies and natural remedies for situations such as stress, depression, ADHD, asthma, low back pain, headaches, anxiety, insomnia. Consider starting with other less harmful drugs before moving on to illegal drugs. not too widespread in the Internet

In fact, over the years, the healthcare system costs a lot of money and these addictive drugs cost a lot of money too. However, the healthcare system costs only a small percentage of a luxury car purchase cost. Compare that to, say, marijuana, which costs only a few hundred dollars. However, with any luck, these scores will only be used as guidelines.

The reason some of the components of code are used to avoid getting locked down is that it's very complex to write code that complies with every single expected/not-expected condition.

Maybe some of your code should be rewritten to make it a little more concise to make it more readable, but you've already done this.

Someone who made a huge profit out of the disinformation spread out of a politically motivated and money motivated website. Someone who has a very bad motive behind his practice. Listen. Not a doctor. A man who will do anything for money. Someone who should not have practiced medicine. Someone with extremely reckless behavior. Someone who should be disciplined and charged with criminal behavior.

6069	I'd be very cautious about such allegations. The supposed copay was announced publicly and left open for rebuttal. Certainly not the amount referenced in the article. If anyone has evidence they should lay it out in public. That said, as we all know it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel. The article is just providing a short review. I myself find the next link to be frightening in its skewed sensationalist tone. They forge the base arguments of other sources and place a lot of hysteria in them.

That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy.

6076	 I don't understand the question. I'm sorry. :( I think that religion should not rule morality completely for all. My own morality is separate from religion. I think the world would be a better place if people made their moral decisions in the free scope of their principles without religious cartels. I'm a Christian and I understand you. I think religion should not be the reason to break your principles and practice harming yourself. What is your reason? your own personal opinion
6077	  I believe that morals should be like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribe them by their religion. </p>

6080	  Promoting Complex Self-Organizing Matter as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could shoot rockets to mars loaded with millions of types of microbes in the hope that some would survive and spread. Then hit the oceanic moons. As stupid as that plan may be, it's way better than shuffling along with no species-level goal (other than the core goal of survival). If we just measure ourselves by how efficiently we turn food into people, as nature wills, we'll miss our chance at grandeur. Humankind isn't going to be around forever. We need to do something really excellent before we go extinct.
6081	 My vote is for PROMOTING ALL LIFE (organisms) onto an actively growing planet as our Ultimate Goal. That is the ultimate context for the other goals that people can pursue. This is of course not the only purpose of a world, but it is one that is highly important.  For us, not humanity as a whole, our ultimate goal should be to promote all life onto an actively growing planet. If we kill, we will lose our mission, and we will be destroyed.
6082	  My vote is for God's Truth as the ultimate purpose of life in this universe. God is great. When I look at God, I know what's right. He's my wonderful hope and if I follow him, I'll never despair. Our prayers and worship lead him to act in a way that will protect and serve us and help us find our ultimate purpose. We, as God's creatures, depend on him to make us happier. I hope many people will look at their religious beliefs and see them as a guide to eternal life.

6088	 Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like. I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)?

6095	 A college town is a college located in a large urban area. The other option you can consider is a community college that is located within a large urban area. In other words, if living in a college town does not work for you, you can go to a community college near a large urban area. The type of education you receive while going to school is the same in both, just the location may be a little different. You will be more socially competent if you go to a larger university, such as a college or university.
6096	 university can provide a similar experience to a "college town" considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion.<br /><br />   Students living in urban areas have to be separated from large numbers of people their own age, and this creates a problem for their social competence.    Incompetence in this area is often an important cause of sociopaths. much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development.    Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age.    Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. as such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent
6097	If you go to a university with few people living on campus, graduate with far fewer social skills, and will generally not have as much confidence about how to interact with other people. That means they will need support from their parents to do so and this undermines the foundation of the argument because what is being disputed is supposed to be true for all students- regardless of parental support. This post has been closed for discussion and will not be reopened. It no longer meets the discussion guidelines.
6098	My friends go to community colleges for better social skills and then go to state schools for grade school & high school but this is an unethical and unopen. Let them go to community college, if that is their choice. Just the people with the most money can go to private schools or community colleges and throw most of the others to the wayside with no options. Ok the amount of people living in a small town is different than in a large city, but every single person needs to be treated in the same manner. My 3 arguments can be grouped to:
6099	small towns college town size concerns are absurd social vs educational skills issues are not a valid consideration when looking at college town issues, now you little geek yourself don't know the difference? little geek yourself don't know the difference? student body that is older than the average college student to a larger body of mostly adults. large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. as such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.
6100	The recession put many companies out of work as has been happening now in much of the western world with its global unpreparedness for economy crash. In fact, this unpreparedness has sparked a recession worldwide that will continue to buffet the western world for years, if not decades. Response: Unpreparedness of western economies across the globe, working by governments into recessions by current economies won't permit the economic development required to mitigate the harsh new world order (see "What Underlies the West's Crisis" by Michael Stone and "The Middle Class Meltdown" by Micha Horowitz). CMV
6101	Please make the main argument in lower paragraph, which is great (using this to response to another staff member‚Äôs comment): Two decades ago the wholesale price index was much higher for final goods, especially for furniture. The list of cost jumpers in the retail price is long, including: The departure of home contractors, many people offering their services on the Internet. No mention of computer manufacturers lowering prices. How can any shopkeeper afford to spend more than 300% profit margin on new purchases? PC parts go down nearly every year. Conversely, Consumer electronics, home appliances, appliances in general, electrical equipment, clothing, shoes, computers, software and whole family entertainment are up to 75% or more for seasonal products.
6102	Why couldn't the employer provide a good living for workers in the first place? It can't. You may also like:  Your text is incomplete!  You may not like:  What should be added: more cheap labor?

6103	Many reasons. For example, they can make more money from the increase in competition. It also makes finding labor easier, as anyone and everyone is capable of finding a job due to the low skill requirements of lower class workers. It makes it easier to recruit a cheap labor force to stay in a depressed economy. Businesses use cheap immigrant labor to further gain. The more they push the lower class into a lower wage class, the better off they are.
6104	Given this scenario, employers would be motivated to search for reasons to hire new employees, decreasing employees' chances of finding jobs. CMV  Document the text containing your solution today. As mentioned in the job title, I am writing this cover letter to apply for the position of Developer/PM. I have 2 years of experience in business/IT planning and design and I've learned a lot from previous employers. I have worked on several projects that used Ruby on Rails and use Java and other languages to make sure software is built correctly and securely. I have a lot of experience with Frontend solutions as well, but I'm not sure I'd be able to work well with legacy code. Ruby on Rails has changed my perspective about how to work effectively with inter-dependent components. I would be happy to talk to you more about my experience and ask any questions that you may have.
6105	The government isn't responsible for keeping me safe from a self-help approach even if they knowingly want me to die. Once my means to defend myself have been removed, the government can't be responsible for keeping me safe through the use of the force against me. However, they cannot stop the violence. And they wouldn't want to. They would be as guilty as I if they were to happen upon a situation like that. The people who commit self murder/self harm on the other hand, are not blameworthy and should not be treated the same ways as if they are breaking the law. In an ideal world there would be no murders but life will never be perfect.
6106	 If I can access a gun, I would get someone else to go with me to shoot the gun so I won't have to risk my life all by myself. Not only would it show me that I don't agree with the actions of the intruder, but it would also show the public that they should respect me and my rights. Take me to court if the government deprived someone else of the means to defend themselves. The government should be readily available to give someone else an equal chance of protection as if I have a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in someone else's home. I think that is enough time for someone else to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.
6107	Question 6: What does the government do that you do? similarly expose yourself to threats without a significant benefit? Answer not in context of test case. However, this is not true. Think of a situation where your home is discovered via the police and the intruder is gunning for you. You will most likely react with frantic running. In most cases, the stress will trigger your adrenaline and send your body to fight or flight. If you are shot and have no covering other than a large bruised head, you cannot run in an environment like that. You would not be able to survive long with no pain or damage to your body. The stress of being shot or injured would be so heavy on your body that you would likely try to escape on foot into a safe place that will most likely lead you to a hospital with doctors able to help you. Therefore, the blame for an injured person is mainly attributable to the shooter.
6108	 What being at risk of being harmed means is that one should be able to defend themselves to the best of their ability regardless of where they are due to what dangers they could confront. For example, if one is walking in an area with an armed intruder, as the government fails to protect me, then it is my duty to defend myself even if those with better weapons and abilities would have a better chance of staying alive. That is because due to the deficiencies in my capabilities and resources, I would likely have a greater propensity of being injured or even killed if I did not defend myself.
6109	  elif 'what do you think?' in context: ...   if they were able to defend themselves and are dead or injured, the 'government helps to make that happen'......if they could have only self defense, they would have the means to defend themselves.hmmmmm and yes, the situation is aggravated if they feel the government helps them with such crimes...i think it is possible that a round of peoples discontent will begin. why is the population so angry and upset with the government even when there are lots of resources in the country ???

6111	an entrepreneur should be respected, not persecuted, for inventing new products. By keeping high levels of innovation, new products are made more efficiently, more quickly, and better. This is no less true with anti-intellectual property laws than it is with more traditional copyright laws. The old idea of a canon is unfortunate. I highly disagree with letting anyone else control what you can or cannot read or show in theatres. Whence does an entrepreneur get inspiration for new products?
6112	E.g. that invention is a private effort. a survey of previous inventions should be done to pick new inventions. After that a patent should be issued to the individual(s) that went into the research. That will allow innovators to dedicate their lives to their new idea. patent them on their new inventions as free
6113	 invention should be applied and not limited by prior knowledge. However, human creativity is being fueled by technological innovation, and this competition discourages collaboration. Moreover, it is extremely difficult for unpaid individuals to find the time, resources, or incentives to innovate as a result of the complex relationship between patents and research. It may be beneficial to reduce the scale of the intellectual property sphere, so we can continue to find inspiration in the sphere of science, without compromising the incentive to innovate and reduce the cost to develop new products for the consumer.
6114	Yes, I agree, greater protection is necessary to increase innovation. While probably not a complete solution to the problem, e.g. too many conservatives would outvote the minorities of innovators, I think there is an argument to be made. Liberty and progress go hand in hand. That said, the level of protection has a negative relationship with the amount of creativity in the world and should not be over-conservative.
6115	 I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide Re: The Palestinians killed more people than Israel got killed in. this seems inherently wrong In what is an unethical way, Israel kept Israelis alive during the Holocaust. In what is unethical and short-sighted way, Israel saved many Jews from the Holocaust by destroying housing

6117	 These findings are fairly alarming. If the palestinians hate the Isrealians, it is not love and compassion, but hate that makes them do such things.   Also a conspicuous amount of hatred toward the west and possibly the U.S. What else does "the worst thing about racism is that it does not

6119	  Based on my nationality and my ethnicity, I don't support the killing of palestinians and yes it really does look like genocide. I'm not leaving a party, religious, ethnic or political affiliation. I'm simply stating facts. At least one Israel has gone to extreme measures to take down a massive Palestinian civilian infrastructure by using tanks and tanks that resemble tanks of the Second World War.
6120	You are entitled to show, a clear non pierced tattoo or 1 of your piercings as long as no offensive imagery is on your body. To show that your are 15-15 or youthful, I would suggest selling jewelry such as bull necklaces which can be used as bags or hung as necklaces. I believe it is better than wearing style that is prohibitive at that age and age related fashion.
6121	 . . . I do not know why tattoos and piercings are viewed negatively. I realize that a part of my answer is incorrect and I would prefer a complete rejection of these things. No tattoos, but an interesting cultural theme and fancy jewelry would be great, however, I would prefer a complete rejection of piercings. I also would prefer a complete rejection of piercings.
6122	 The bullying or negative judgement may have a negative impact on both the positive and the negative impact of work, but to consider it in such a way as to not allow this kind of things in the office at all because of a bad attitude is a short sighted view to take for many reasons. If your work has such a policy, then that's fine. It is just a fact based on my experiences.

Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.

6130	Propose a new policy that allows you to be 18 without having to be required to have your photo ID with you.              You should be able to go to the polls on Election Day, regardless of ID or age. We should at least back reform. Let me clarify my position on Election Day: when you go to vote, you don't need to have an ID. This shouldn't be a science experiment! Just give it time, you're not going to be 30 forever.
6131	I would suggest that the government work on better tracking systems for voter registration, voter fraud prevention, etc, and then we can talk about whether voter ID will be a good idea for all political processes.  In the meantime, just stick to the 'we promise to only support such an ID proposal and others if it takes action on voter fraud.' rather than 'yes we are here to question people and tell you that you do not understand the issue, thus we get you fired from presenting ID.'
6132	If nothing else it has the potential to push younger or illegally foreigners into the voting sphere and will make people who are poor feel that their chances for success are too low to attempt to register and vote.  On top of that the record of not complying will be more difficult to remove. I'd be supportive of it but only if it's enforced widely(not just states with small populations) and then re-regulated
6133	 I would start by saying it was more of a suggestion than an issue or actual fact in my opinion.  Next it would be to say that the media has made a misunderstanding on what 'fingerprints' are really about; they're about having to prove what you're saying, which is this goal of a complete voter ID program: to get rid of voter fraud which is very low risk compared to election fraud, crime and identity theft.
6134	My bias: Since most people have had bad priorities over the course of their lives, that the lack of an ID would penalize them also be penalized.  People who need their ID to get their next Job out of a job do not feel a sense of urgency for voting. to me doing something important is more valuable than having a chance to get something else important, in this case a Job.

6137	 As a 12-hr clock is a longstanding tradition, we might consider using an offset to implement a 24-hr time system. This way, we might try and force everybody to switch over to 24-hr time. At least, it would be interesting to see whether or not it would be a success. However, I'm not sure whether or not it would actually work, given that most of us don't use a clock anymore to help us figure out the time.
6138	What would be the best solution to stop using 12-hr clocks?   If 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.)

6142	After Hitler, World War II was terrible to the Japanese as well. Giving World War II to the Americans was a terrible mistake as they had become so powerful and this would have been very unfortunate. Japan's relations with the Japanese was worse than ever. Many Japanese's hearts were broken, and many suicides were inflicted by world war. Also this war caused Japan to lose Pearl Harbor, and around 40,000 Americans were killed, most of which were the Navy as FDR knew Japan's weakness.
6143	The concept of fascism is considered a negative concept by many, but it is considered positive by some due to great leaders. Fascism remains a subject of much debate. I have very little knowledge of the topic of fascism. I will say that in my opinion, the concept would remain a social norm in western countries due to great leaders like in Eastern Europe and japan. probably with more extensive Nazi-era just in the shadow of humankind in their minds for the rest of the world. reason for this I feel that first people should be educated on history.

Tell people that rape victims should be heard when they speak and let them tell the world their story and come out from shame and if anyone wonders why women don't think they were raped they said person just said they were a good person and a good mother because they were scared. If I could take a message of abortion I would try to speak out of it everyday that abortion shouldn't be a choice people should be informed. Read more about things to do to prevent baby killing.
6197	OMG!!! Why do i put this on here??????? Why do i post my stupid comment?? I don't even know how to explain how irked i get at this!!! By the way how is your mission? This is a stupid comment!!! Do not respond to this!!! If you want to respond to it, i know if you will be kind and just come up with an answer that is worthy of an answer. Catholic gives a baby a job when it reaches term?
6198	Killing the child should be illegal because it is against my religion. While killing the embryo in the womb is legal, and that has made abortion easy to do with, killing a live fetus isn‚Äôt. Someone should be put in jail for making that choice, but one should not commit murder, which is the crime it seems that you‚Äôre arguing. let a child die because of irresponsibility?? Satan must be real please. Kill someone that is sick or run over someone that is accidently killed and they have no choice. The issue at hand is: why does abortion happen, not if abortion should happen
6199	 You should put it up for adoption. To put the baby up for adoption is to help the child to go on to a better and brighter future. It also allows the parents to heal from a tragic life. The parents of a dead child have problems with overcoming trauma, and it can be detrimental to the mental health of the parent. People that do not understand the concept of adoption are often offended by it. I'm a parent and yes, it is against my religion, but this is my opinion.

They should die. _" ), 5 )
6201	Deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die. Thanks for presenting this thought-experiment! I am very interested in seeing this improvement of the original argument! ### Arguments: My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die. ### Solution: Deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.

If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. I agree with your extended arguments. That said, killing people at mass murder level is against the law in many countries. If you would like to write me a concise answer below that, let me know.

6203	 That may be a good point, but you can't kill anyone if you don't let them die first, period. There would be no way to even go to court to get a sentence of murder unless that person already existed. The only way you can kill someone legally is if you let them die first. We can let many people die, and we really should not. Why would we put them through that, all so you can argue your case?
6204	Argument 2 as the case scenario. The referee responded that they could leave the debate with that opening and a question, and that the case scenario is a rebuttal of both arguments. Argument 2 This is not an appropriate analogy. Everyone in this debate understands what killing someone means, so there's no need to explain it here. This person must be doing something that, as they like to put it, smacks of "petty Bigotry." Argument 1 My first regular argument is that you get what you deserve. Your disagreement can not be used as an example.

We have to change this. We must avoid world inflation.

6209	Violence is perpetuated and caused by the influence of society. It is caused by television programming and is not due to video games. Suicides are lower in small farming communities than in large cities, because there is a small sense of community and friendliness. There are less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other. It is caused by television programming. Such a threat is based on our society's obsession with surface, ephemeral, ephemeral and stupid stimuli. Society that we live in today is filled with false ideals. Due to advertising, people's desires are flooded with unattainable ideals which are the source of our perverted obsession with presenting the worst possible case.

6220	Love is nothing more than a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? Atleast for a period of time. Look at adults.

This is not a new generation. This is something that has always been happening even before teens could walk around. Love does not always require a serious commitment. Some people fall in love and find in themselves the ability to move forward in life, while others do not. Take care not to rely on this stereotype.
6224	Love is a complex emotional experience. Look at teens who are in a relationships. Tons of pressure is put on people in teen relationships. It's a tough place to grow up.

No need to insult people and say that teens are too young to fall in love. ### Output: teenagers should make their own love

In fact, this author thinks it is good and valuable. As such, this author feels that this should be sufficient to counteract the negative aspects of such a situation, no matter how negative they may be. The author ultimately suggests that people go up to the person, offer support, and reach out, and sees this as valid if that person doesn't follow the request.

The child has no choice. But I guess that the children and society also shouldn't be too quick to decide the fallout because the child may act out again if the limits of punishment were not enforced.
6228	Whether to confront someone when they are slapping someone else has always been a matter of moral philosophy for both secular and religious organizations. This is also a moral issue. Judaism is united on this issue. According to the Talmud: "Dig in your heels and slap them back." They say to defend your oppressed brothers at any cost. Shabbattav and Rabbenu Gorayeb wanted to defend themselves in the usual way - with a physical action. It is an issue to weigh: use them as an opportunity to argue about it. I would not slap this person. The police, prosecutors, or child protective services are in a position to protect people from violent threats against them. The training they received raises issues that do not belong to me.

Only that person decide whether or not they get drugs. The Hall of Fame is the only place that should be able to deal with this issue. None of them could fit into that institution!
6231	None of the above choices .

Our first duty is to honour him in a future in the Hall of Fame as our most worthy member.
6232	Yes, I don't think steroid use will change baseball's records. Yes, I think it is absurd. They, the Hall of Fame, should not discriminate because of steroids! You're either in or you are not, either way your Hall career is an unalterable consequence! Yes, the Hall of Fame should not discriminate.
6233	None of the above choices . Thanks for your time. Accept it. Go ahead, go for it. None of the above choices . Hmm. That's a half- acceptable option.   Observations   steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed because of this? Probably.
6234	In 1984 the Olympic Games were held. is a museum that chronicles the history or baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of 'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous.

6235	What do you think of this debate... No moral to it at all. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women. And while our current message is the position of a mother, it's fine that children choose the one that works for them. If someone steps in and raises the child then it is always for better for the child. You have to love the child.
6236	 We will continue to bring equality for men and women. That is what the liberal mindset is all about. In the courts of Egypt, however, the truth is that men choose children to be raised by them. Women were not necessary in either the homes or the courts, and their lives are still beyond the reach of law, largely through tradition.
6237	 women have to raise children to be somebody one day. Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, i think they MUST STEP IN. Women's rights education is a men issue, you know?
6238	I just think that couples who have children should choose who to have them with. No parent should have the right to decide who a child should be raised by without their consent. I think that couples who want kids should just get them, without asking who they are going to raise them with.
6239	Without effective change, women are going to be the ones who have to raise the children themselves. This responsibility should belong to the father. - Mook Authoridaders and Joreen Jackson-29th Scrum Up because her children MORE than anybody else deserves a father in her life.

Local restaurant. Been several times. Thoroughly satisfied. Thanks for taking the time to update your Review. The food is always amazing! Thank you! It was a great while, since this last review, that I had the privilege to review the Zen Thai Restaurant.I have eaten a lot of Thai food from Indian and Chinese restaurants (where this type of food comes from) and Zen Thai has everything Thai with some Asian influences.All that I found delicious until now are Pad Thai and chicken, but today I had the Peanut Balm (pad thai chicken sesame) where they used roasted peanuts and raisins and the Restaurant was ready to make the plate with the extras in it and I was astonished...
6258	  Food, great service, friendly staff, clean and tidy. We have been there about 7 times and have never once been disappointed. I can't wait to go there again. I have never been to a restaurant where I have felt that I was better treated, where the food was of higher quality than at The Zen. That's what people think at restaurants but in reality it's not, here my life is at the Zen.

6266	Beef Wellington from Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video and website text explanation I made Beef Wellington at home tonight with Gordon Ramsay's instructions. I made a little variation, I actually realized that I didn't need to crumble the bread pudding and use one whole instead of two halves. That's about all I can say, the recipe will work. I just hope that I didn't ruin my skill set. Thanks so much! Beef Wellington from Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video and website text explanation The other people at the table couldn't stop raving about my Beef Wellington dish as the meat was so tender it melted in their mouths.
6267	 Yes, all great!\n Yes, the food was excellent! The Beef Wellington was especially delicious. I was glad I didn't order to share it with someone else. I would recommend Beef Wellington from Gordon Ramsay's Roosters and Pigeons to anyone! Yes, we had an excellent experience! Perhaps we will try the Beef Wellington at their restaurant next time. Yes, we were satisfied! Yes, we had an excellent experience. With the exception of one comment about the spacing of the menu, we would be happy to stay in your hotel again.

6268	 The writer enjoys watching Gordon Ramsay's cooking videos, and would like to learn how to make beef wellington. The writer has never tried beef wellington. The writer orders the dinner special on Yelp: Beef Wellington, Caesar salad, bread pudding for dessert, and a side of Mac n cheese. The writer is very full after eating the dinner special and leaves most of the Mac n cheese home. The writer describes beef wellington as the most tender meat she has ever had. The writer decides to make her own beef wellington at home with Gordon Ramsay's video.

6270	negative This is not a positive review. This restaurant was small, slow and I had very low expectations for what I would receive at a breakfast joint. Clearly, I was not the only one. I wouldn't describe the service as slow - but I would imagine that it could be better. The food was very mediocre and the standard of food at a Tim Horton‚Äôs today clearly reflects my expectation level. Not going back, it is obvious that breakfast is hardly ever the time to ever review a restaurant online.

6320	 Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
6321	For some reason I don't think my father was very involved in my life in the beginning. I believe that there were some duties that he had to do and that he was already busy with those duties. I think I took it pretty well because I'm by far the goofy one in my family.

6323	Where he was fatherless. When he was absent, I would like him not to be in my life, but instead I would like to think that in his absence he would be on my life. I just wish I knew what was going to happen to me when he was away, and what I would do in his absence. Where he would be absent. I was faced with not knowing if I was coming back or if I was lost.  You do not know what to do without your father.
6324	 Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A fatherless child knows nothing of her father. This also means that an absent father could come in and be too present. This may be okay for some, but it can also ruin a child's life. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
6325	I don't think you should motherless. i don't think a father should do everything for his kids, what is wrong with a mother? fatherless is a better option, so leave me a comment and tell me why you feel like that. yes, i think fatherless would be better. what do you think about fatherless?
6326	What we really need father is understanding, so if a father really does know that their child does not have a father, that they should get themselves a father. I think they are such a hindrance in peoples lives but one is not evil if the other gets it together. Can't say enough about how fatherless my life has been.
6327	A self taught person who is lousy and lazy like their father... better off fatherless. School is supposed to teach us skills to benefit others so at least if you are not going to benefit anyone in a way in school your skills are not going to help anyone either.  Found 1 revision

It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen My Mother but if she doesn't care then why should I? If she wanted to be in My life she could've been in My life. But being single is not bad because I have My Brother and To me that's My Mother. I would rather have a Mother who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.
6331	 I'd like to see the fatherless mother. I was fatherless. Maybe you had a father who passed away as well. It was hard to know how to parent without a father. I strongly believe that my mother raised me all on her own. Since you are childless yourself I know that it can be hard to be with your mother but she will stand by you for life and try her best to support you. Your mother will love you for that.

6333	In my opinion, being fatherless is better because i have my mother. i don't have my father so i can grow up faster, so i guess it's better because its faster, i guess i'm wrong because i haven't been fatherless for about 20 years now. i also know that it's better because of how he supports me and be there for me my father doesn't do that.
6334	It would be better if he would've been the more supportive type who wanted to spend time with me and is far better in any sense because I am not the worst child. I want to have a father because I want him to like me and want to be in my life.

6413	Women can be degraded by pornography or can become a pornographic performer.
6414	It's not easy being a pornographic actor, be careful with your choices if you want to do that.
6415	First, find out if children have easy access to porn. Then implement the following for your class assignment to help.
6416	 Only 9 percent of college students have ever told their parents about their sexual desires
6417	Good idea and should be implemented. Bring it on.  ### options:  cmdline 'hug me

6420	 Instead of calling to not produce porn, I would call to not be an actor in porn. Indeed, I'd like to say make a public statement to society that we're no longer going to participate in such a degrading business, with the apparent intention of punishing anyone involved. If only we could succeed in that!

6425	Some people say that God is against porn because the Bible does not allow it to be a sin.
6426	1  What seems to be the most effective answer for this task?   1   Sold... No competition
6427	a sin because it is against god's word. because god's word is very clear on against porn.
6428	They say that because they have no evidence, so now no evidence would be used. Change The following argument is not broken so it would have a minimal impact on the original argument. Change the section The bible does not mention sex without a condom.

6430	We need to look for common objectives, instead of pursuing our own goals in society. Promoting the common good is better than pursuing individual goals.
6431	 If all of them care about the community people are not scared of others. it is good for people to raise their community. it makes people feel safer.
6432	I would help people to improve their community by sharing information. That way I would feel satisfied even if I achieve my personal goals. I would do more since I think I am improving the community.
6433	 I agree with this opinion that personal pursuit is not better than advancing the common good. We need to think about our community first before we think about ourselves.
6434	 If you had your own household, your family would be better off and everyone would have a better future for themselves. And if you were a caregiver for your community, the other members of that community would also be better off.
6435	 Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6436	The answer is better because advancing the common good is a team sport to all of them to believe in each other to get a good result. progress of technology will improve the world and society as a whole because it will raise our standard of living and our technological level. less good as technology is often used as a way to kill and monitor one another. the bible says advancing the common good is better in the Super Bowl
6437	 Advanced the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6438	 Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.
6439	But they could use more help with a smaller amount of support from the local municipality in the construction of their community center and the free encyclopedia that would go with that. Also they could use more support for the football team but that's only a part of the money they need to raise. There is no community center or free encyclopedia that does not have a big part of that in the making.   Suggestions: Other wonderful team sports, their community center, their free encyclopedia, football, and local municipality
6440	 Look after others first, not your own self.  Make the following change:  ### Rewritten to: Look after others before, not after. i agree that I believe in the common success of what goes around comes around...
6441	 I would recommend that you consider this better than personal pursuit. Look after the common goods, that can never go wrong. Consider this better than personal pursuit. Look after the common goods, that can never go wrong. Look after the common goods, that can never go wrong.
6442	 Helps others first, do n't worry about what others think about you. Means more to society compared to most people than you do know. Taking care of friends and family first, then paying attention to your career.
6443	 I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
6444	 I think when you do something for other people you should look out for yourself. Doing something for other people before you look out for yourself does not only help them but something good will also come back to you. Thanks for contributing!
6445	 Yes, school uniforms should be abolished because it makes all of our children the same and they do NOT deserve to be made the same. Instead we should be allowed to wear pants, shorts, shirts, socks, shoes, accessories, wears what we want and find what we want

6449	1. If there is no reason for a uniform such as at schools it shouldn't matter what children wear when they are at school just make sure it makes them feel equal and it doesn't hurt anyone. 2. Uniforms are annoying and can hurt different people because some people can handle them and other people can't and for the longest time it would be better to decide not to wear a uniform to schools 1. Every child should be able to wear whatever the child likes and fits them, most people who go to schools without a uniform find them in less than 10 min of getting them on. 2. Schools are for learning so parents are looking for ways to make their children more productive and avoid problems

However, I think drinking bottled water if done properly is actually good for the economy. Since plastics can easily be recycled, I believe that drinking bottled water would also benefit the environment. March 21, 2013UPDATED:  ### Plastic bottles make up roughly 35% of all life cycle decisions.
6501	  Tl; the market is a very important decision to make in business so think about that before you purchase products like bottled water. Price: $20.66 + $2.19 = $29.83  20% Off How much is $10.85 before shipping? Then what is the minimum amount you need to pay to save this deal? $24.84 After coupon discount, the total price would be $12.71

6541	Notmymuse, Since you believe in Christianity you will continue to believe in bible bullshit. Christianity clearly is a theological rather than empirical belief system. It says nothing about what's out there beyond this god of yours.  Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one.  I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary.

Christianity is false because you are a religious idiot. Christianity is false because you are a religious idiot. Christianity is false because you are a religious idiot.
6544	I have no time to waste on that stupid bible bullshit Christianity, the Jesus bible bullshit, but the rest of your arguments do sound to be correct. If there are no empirical or rational arguments for any gods, it is NOT a valid case to state god exists. I‚Äôll ignore it for now. I can do that, but I won't.
6545	Wene wene weneeeeee, god exists and that much can be safely assumed.

6555	 My opinion is that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6556	 If parents decide to spank their children they should be aware that spanking isn't always effective.
6557	Yes, I think it's a very good idea to use spanking to discipline children.
6558	 In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6559	Parents should punish their children by using spanking. Dr. W is correct.   ### Comment: I agree with Dr. W's opinion.

6563	Yes, they think so. I'm not surprised. They think this will teach them lessons

6566	I'm 10 now. I can handle things better. Nowadays, I'd say abuse is never good. I would rather complain to my parents.
6567	 We all went to the festivities. My parents must have been responsible or how we stayed together. They actually showed us a lot of interest in going because they got upset that we didn't. We should have appreciated. There are parents who are abusive and that they have never been spanked either. If we did something to their kids, they would be severely punished, especially if their kids are young.

6605	Yes, I agree that when it gets too much you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.

6607	Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
6608	Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.

6615	 Yes. It makes good sense. Let me give the example of sibling rivalry. You can strike your brother if you get excited, angry, or cause trouble but it doesn't mean that you know better. Only doing the wrong thing because you want to get beat up does not help. As a child, it is perfectly fine to reach out to parents when you are upset about something, so don't be afraid to get mad when you do
6616	 No child deserves to be physically punished and girls should NEVER be hit. Never hit a child and always try to be gentle. Never discipline a child with physical punishment. You could hit them with a belt if they were disobedient, but that should NEVER happen.

6619	Discipline a child with correct words first. If they do not listen and do not follow the rules, say the rules with correct words instead of hitting. Discipline a child in a calm manner. You should try to avoid shouting and being yelling at your child if you want to make an effect.

6654	This would be an excellent idea if it weren't for two small changes. First, who's in charge of the world? Should we be exporting eggs? Also, may I remind you that we are sharing resources?

6655	Sometimes people do get cash for their junk clothes; however, it usually isn't for every dollar or cents of them. It should be noted that clothing donation organizations donate clothing to homeless shelters, food banks, charities, or rescue organizations (Organizations like the Salvation Army, Red Cross, or Catholic Charities, etc.), not to businesses. And are usually broke, so they can't really make a profit off of them.

6659	 I don't think it's at all charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to get financial compensation ie a tax write off in return. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? P.S. Why don't you sell the clothing to some homeless 'street' people? They have money from begging and can probably skip a meal or two to buy some clothes. (Just a thought)

Yes, it sounds like you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent unitl proven guilty. No, people also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that. No, a bit unclear about what you are trying to ask. Yes, the officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. Yes, the two cases do have to be considered for an arrest and in the police department as well.
6668	  They are treated differently because a citizen commits an attempted murder and he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found, police officers get bail.

6690	No, prostitution should absolutely not be legalized. To be sure, we need the police to spot illegal trades, but that's only one step in a multi-step process, and it's the one most new police forces don't have the proper tools to handle and the ones most people wouldn't care to get involved in.  It's time for governments and the media to end their disinformation and embrace the policy of legalizing prostitution, as a lower-risk, lower-cost option for regulating prostitution. Yes
6691	prostitution should be legalized, and governments should take jurisdiction over it. who should set, control and enforce the laws? governments; that is a logical extension. When you make that change, the client gets less protection and is more vulnerable, which is a better position.
6692	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws.  Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades.  There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.  Rename the output section section to be more suitable for the argument.
6693	No, prostitution should definitely not be legalized; government should not in any way give the go-ahead to any adult business in or about schools, parks or other publicly accessible spaces. Idolatry of money and sex has been a common occurrence throughout human history, and idolaters are often stuck in spiritual slavery.

6695	 I have some experience and a good reputation in this court so I expect him to agree to represent me.

I am an experienced trial lawyer for a trial and usually have an advantage when litigation comes into play.
6696	He will reject your case if he feels it lacks a sufficient case to merit representation. ###   if it lacks sufficient case to merit representation, he will reject your case. Now that you've cleared that up, you can begin finding an attorney to represent you. Law offices tend to advertise and solicit clients online in some fashion. They will likely have contact information to let you in touch with them. If the law office is willing and able to work with you remotely, they may offer the option of negotiating a remote fee, which could be less expensive for them.

6698	He will respond with his confidence and likelihood of your case being more than 55 percent of his fee and a preemptive listing of the evidence he expects to use to bring the case before the court if you don't accept his offer. Note that the likelihood he is referring to is based upon his existing experience with similar cases. For example, if you have a perfect record, the likelihood of prevailing could be as high as 90 percent.

We are so happy to be relatively free, so that our labor may be . . . But the U.S. tax system is very complex, and in this simple case, there's really no way to fix it. Your client will be praying you didn't raise their taxes yet. My clients are always praying I don't raise taxes.

6713	   ÿ≥Ÿπ€åŸà ŸÑŸàŸÜ⁄Ø: Someone like this is probably an academic student who has seen 'sadistic' in the news and assumed that all scholars were the same way. In addition, this fear of what they don't understand is actually normal. You are not forced to listen to them, either. And as long as you stay within appropriate limits, don't worry. Perhaps you should consider moving the conversation away from academic fields. After all, there are more pressing issues about how to get money. Thanks for speaking with me, academic student. And Happy Disaster Day.

6715	Yes, so yes. remove the religion and let kids learn the truth. I do n't think it is a good idea for kids to learn about religion. Better off they learn about drugs and sex. Children will learn through AVIDS or project based learning. They would rather learn about sex than not.
6716	No Is it legal to push your religeon on those that dont believe in it?!?!?! NoI think that answers your question. Better yet - if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present??? YesOur child will be protected at all costs from intellectual disengagement with the next generation, reinforcing an undeserved advantage to those who are better educated in school than the best of us, through religious indoctrination.
6717	No!  Should religon be removed from schools? yes  Are you religious yourself? yes  Should children learn god??? no  How would you feel if children were forced to learn about the religion or practice it? yes  Comment to Ramarlal: no you not! And an anonid is here to proof it for you.......
6718	No She said she did not want her children to be pushed into believing in god. That is how she described the title. Better yet, students are in school to learn not to that and everything else. They should be required to perform on exams or on something rather than praying from dawn to dusk.
6719	Yes, this is a valid solution. must be mandatory for everyone, whether you want them to be muslims or christian at school. Also has a better notion than the other responses. Must be mandatory. kids aren't at school to learn about religion, they're there to learn and be taught.
6720	 forum.thank you for your input (to a post) is n't enough to asses my stance on this .positive statement in reply to my comment . the actual answer to my question is  the discovery laws and the fact that people have to deal with years of lying by prosecutors ,as well as , the fact that laws are amended from one day to the next to provide a dodge for the repubeican party on the people , and, judicial corruption is very common in the south
6721	well what is up buddy?false imprisonment is something that happens more than you think especially in states that do not have discovery laws .and in my opinon they do not have those laws for the simple reason they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent and "falsely Imprison"them.The southern states ars real good about that. The southern states can avoid discovery because the evidence the they seek can be suppressed.They knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help futher their careers down the road and the part that kills me is not only are these low lifes still able to sleep but,the Law lets them get away with it and when it is,(years later usually)discovered there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
6722	 as long as there is no discoverly then the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent.And yes they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help futher their careers down the road and the part that kills me is not only are these low lifes still able to sleep but,the Law lets them get away with it and when it is,(years later usually)discovered there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
6723	 strike the 3rd answer down dude.false imprisonment can happen even though people do not believe it. in fact, the only thing about it that people do not believe can happen is that an individual does not sleep well at night if he/she knowingly lies about a big deal. the reality of false imprisonment is a reality and it can really happen to anyone. more so it happens in some states that are innocent inmates are railroaded more than others. this because they have no recourse against a railroaded falsely imprisoned person. the more they leave their students vs.the less they know cause they do not want them to succeed.

6725	If they were to bring a claim against us, we would enter into a lawsuit against them. Our attorney might take the case to court, but his fee is more than we can afford. They could also fight the case with their insurance company to try to set you up for a bad case and make the insurance company pay the bill but that would also cost us a lot.
6726	 Your lawyer is bad, but you can't do anything to get the money you're owed. He may send a subpoena, but as you said, you have 17,000 in medical bills and do not own property. Your best chance would be to go to his sister, or grand daughter to collect the money from them. Deal with his lawyer instead. Your lawyer is bad, but you can't do anything to get the money you're owed. He may send a subpoena, but as you said, you have 17,000 in medical bills and do not own property.
6727	My attorney is going to warn you that he will likely be a lot more than that.The person probably lives in the Portland area, but he might practice elsewhere. He might be called in by ambulance if he were to fall and a good-sized bad injury happens to him. The person might not have a ton of money but he probably does own a mortgage or other good credit loan. The expert also says this might be true of the person in this case.
6728	Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc.. If he doesn't own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably won't bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine of you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
6729	 Even your physical health is worth at least $2,000 and your car insurance only covers about 50% of your expenses, you would need at least $17000 for health insurance. Otherwise, you might find that being sued will cost you a good deal more than you have. Your boyfriend likely does not have enough credit to get a mortgage. His brother gave him a car but he was driving his brother's car frequently, which is a reason for his problem. His brother gave it to him because he was a close male family member, but he used it poorly. A seventeen-year-old woman without enough income is usually unable to buy a home, even if she has money.

I want to emphasize that I am not giving out legal advice or information on this, but rather, an opinion, so I would like to outline any legal reasons for my arguments.
6733	 Yes, this is more appropriate. the life sentence, or the state has already decided, for a person who has been convicted and who has already spent two thirds of the total possible sentence in jail, made to work. I am talking about many other people here that have committed minor

6737	Yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are repeat offenders.
6738	While the approach is polished, using military terminology may reduce many objects to obsessions that decrease our ability to care for the welfare of the innocent. How about a universal right to vote, like any other human right (dignity), as long as one is law-abiding? Also, using military terms could be interpreted as patriotism. This is actually an important idea to think about. Just because one uses military terminology, that doesn't necessarily mean one is a patriot, especially when it comes to elections.

Fix the bid currency to match the currency in which you used the lottery ticket. "Our lack of control over the currency will cost us more in the long run than the incompetent [why San Salvador? Uh, he doesn't know exactly what does he know? The government of the U.S.? No. No. The economy of the U.S. Cuban powerhouse in the hemisphere? No. Yes. No.
6741	The President believed the assistant to be correct. China is not a major player on the world stage, and thus we need to keep her influence at a minimum. The president also believed that the Cubans offered more of what we wanted.  In other words, the president trusted in the assistant's assessment. We need more of that, we need chaos in the heartland, we need that fear that gives us flexibility.' - Bush administrations presidents and advisors Asked about the feasibility of choosing targets for war by leading economic indicators, Bush had a positive view, and did so precisely because of the benefit to U.S. commerce and manpower it provides. Nevertheless, the administration focused on the physical and psychological targeting of potential foreign "hotspots".
6742	One in which nearly everything the Americans did in the 1950s was to further their interests in Cuba, thwarting the more important shift to a union of the Spanish-speaking countries of America, which could have been a useful organization in the event of Castro's fall, was an utter mistake.  One in which the Americans did every thing they could to thwart Americanization of Cuba as was happening in Spanish-speaking lands was completely mistake. This author is against Americanizing Cuba, unlike many Americans of course.
6743	Steve Martin, Cuba Must Die The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.
6744	Cuba has much less to offer economically, thus we can afford to sanction those who would freeze it out, in the hope that some change will come to the people there. -- the post-colonial ideal of economic openness and policy flexibility. For more on this, see the reverse:  capitalist model's need to turn impoverished Third World nations into consumer destinations is a more fundamental ideological and political goal of the U.S. hegemony.  The unfortunate reality is that American political and economic interests have been and are being shown a better deal in Cuba than they would have been had the revolutions toppled governments rather than first allowing political space. In other words, it has actually been a far better deal for the U.S.
6745	  You just cost the American people two million dollars in gold bullion."  Geraldo was sent to prison for 35 years for publicity that would deprive American soldiers of the most valuable weapon they have, so you can't call yourself a journalist because it is obvious that your work ethic is also lacking."  Geraldo shoulda been hung for 35 years for causing a slip-up.

6747	  Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information  are not covered by the freedom of the press. When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole. Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want, but it doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences. Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He should have been hung.

When has government helped the facts be known? The answer to those questions should help you decide whether access to this information is important enough to be covered under the freedoms of the press.
6750	 My personal opinion is that the economy went through the roof after the war. That, coupled with other policy decisions I will not go into, caused the depression to occur which led to a people's hatred of the politicians, the banks, the big corporations, and all of that.
6751	 Bush is one terrorist in my opinion because he essentially passes laws against terrorists to his own interest. Everyone should use the constitution to fight him and other terrorists. Your government did not clear the borders between us and terrorists. As a result, what they did is create terrorists.
6752	a warrant is something legal and a government can use to gain access to private information. I still think it would be illegal to access this way! access to private information to gain access to terrorists I would personally think of it as an invasion of privacy and possibly a criminal offense.
6753	Is should not be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop on the legal way. Bush is just trying cover his butts, as well as other members of our government are doing likewise. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government, I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back.
6754	It's not too hard to see who's blocking our liberties in this case. Show interest in the world around you, particularly, make someone see the incredible potential power a better education and misguided social trends have on not only themselves, but society as a whole. Have that mindset.
6755	 OJ Simpson once said, ``I don't care where the body is, as long as I am the one that finds it.'' He said this after murdering his wife. Scott never said this. BAD.  Comment 3 Person (with no knowledge of the case): OJ was a white celebrity. 1) Can't you see how much this has to do with race? 2) If you want to skewer me, target my race not my crimes. 3) OJ as a white guy can skewer (tribe?) Killers. 3) Yes, he can. This gets even more into the racially age-old stereotypes and represents poor cultural understanding. This represents your ignorance, not the speaker's.
6756	He was not a celebrity, he was an "everyman" like OJ. Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci, were nice looking so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched OJ and Micheal Douglas in Fatal Attraction. Scott Peterson is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us.
6757	No one blamed OJ for killing his wife. Everyone blamed Laci. Scott Peterson seems like he could have been an easy victim if someone with less gravity in their eyes had pretended to be obsessed with OJ by trying to seduce his wife - that would have been easier. This doesn't mean that Scott didn't do something wrong. It just that the real reason we watch this case is that it put our feelings into words, and remade something that we are all dealing with in one way or another. this changed the way we see justice. People hope that what happened to OJ will never happen to them. We know that it could. These are just your feelings about this case. 1) We can only blame ourselves for being as little like OJ as he was when compared to Laci 2) So are we really any less good than OJ - can we be a tenth as good? No
6758	    The truth will out Micheal Douglas and Glen Close, not in the simple term of OJ Simpson. Laci Maroney is the same on an episode of Jeopardy that way that she is on the outside. Her power lies in not having words - she makes them stand out. Scott Peterson is a flawed individual who killed a woman his wife thought he was staring at when he was staring at her. If Laci had been staring at him, she would know he was not staring at her. 1) Laci didn't actually stare at Scott - the stare that was supposed to be sincere was contaminated by her pain and expectation that something would happen at the end of the day. When he first finds out she is pregnant, she is overcome with a load of good will. He throws away all the work and turns to her on one channel while he is on another, sometimes repeatedly, actually the same channel on which she watches politics or sports - we know he's doing something good, yet he is breaking all the rules. He'd been sleeping with her several times in the interim and knew she thought he was not only interested, but that he really wanted her to be pregnant, so she could have the condom on hand. She also gave in and agreed to eat more, yet even while she is pregnant, she is obsessed with the weight. She is obese and dissatisfied with her life - it's a tough combination.
6759	  OJ's clothing, morals, and driving seem far more commendable. We consider "everyman" Mr. Scodsen to be an ignominious miscarriage of justice in the eyes of morality. It seems far more dishonorable that white males should dishonor white females by murdering them for sex. We think that he needs the same level of respect and commiseration that black males who do that have. The judge gave OJ punishment befitting his crime - black celebrity. We consider that far more righteous than dishonorable. No man deserves to get off lightly for the heinous actions they took to get what they wanted.
6760	DontTruthfullyDice: Yes. The argument for ending the death penalty makes little sense. Nobody is 'seeking to undermine society.' Singapore is the definition of a society that tolerates diversity and the people there like it as a society, but they were asked a question that the majority of the country opposed. They need to think seriously about the words of the people who wrote the book. Won the Nobel Prize.
6761	Yes, it is criminal to seek to undermine society as well as it is criminal to kill. No, Singapore did not make those decisions and did not have to do so. And, as true as it is that 'threats of violence' do not result in threats of violence, can we please respect the fact that those will bring us to the brink of civil war?  Where is the justice in both of these approaches?
6762	I disagree. I personally wish that all abortionists would be imprisoned for the rest of their lives with absolutely no exceptions. It has to be the choice of people who know what they are doing, and are mature enough to stand up for it in the face of death. I would never be so callous to begin to condone the idea of killing someone simply because of their having been impregnated, and I would hope that Singaporean would not have the same callousness towards those they‚Äôve transgressed against.
6763	Yes  The residents of Hong Kong have far less say in the decision to impose the death penalty. that they overrule the law established by others. * Then he described an alternate version of a much more restrictive version of the death penalty than has the current law. * We are not convinced that *there is widespread discrimination, biased or otherwise against non-Singaporeans in Singapore;*   but we believe that Singapore's approach to enforcing the law is particularly restrictive.  Incentive* *The writer is arguing that the system *is not actually restricting the dissenters (he was careful to distinguish them from the perpetrators of murder);*  and therefore do not understand the criticism as a form of violation of rights. Person* He argued that *people feel that the government is trying to legitimise the deprivation of life*; it isn't because of the death penalty.  Reframing  Tag *Writers: debate*
6764	 Disagree. people of a majority culture are intinctive of being stronger than minorities. the government in singapore is trying to feed upon people's ignorance on the nature of the death penalty. despite this article, Singapore is really not that nice compared to the United States, even though you will see racism all over the place. another fact that proves racism really does exist in the USA: even the black people who are not being allowed to make their own decisions have very high rates of incarceration because we just don't want them to be born.
6765	Well, they obviously want to leave marriage, too. Hooray for the Orange Menace! It took the Supreme Court 20 years to rule in favor of marriage for gay men. Are they going to wait another 20 years to let gay men in the water park? Nice idea!
6766	If your logic is foolish, you'll find that reasonable people disagree with you. Marriage is a good thing. How'd you ever figure to defame marriage? The important thing is not how they defend marriage, it's what they defend. What they do to get from that point.
6767	Speech: They 're in fact saying that men shouldn't be wives # an has-been traditional sexist idea... I kinda agree but really don't think they 're being that honest. #  everyone else¬†?!
6768	 Instead of fighting against marriage, change all the laws of marriage to prevent adultery, divorce and re-marriage, and make adultery a felony. Then you'll truly be defending marriage. Re-write the message   But don't act like animals!
6769	 Take the time out of your day to study Mary Hamilton's "How to Rape a Girlfriend" for your own protection. Everyone is married. On average, people marry once every 7.4 seconds.

6771	  Every country should have free speech. Communication through social media is one of the highest forms of freedom in the world today. Everyone has the right to information and everyone can make their own conclusions about what is acceptable to the government and society. for the citizen's rights. and no information restriction should be based on the size of the government.

6777	Yes I would like to reproduce this text exactly for someone to view it. anti-racism fuels new racism. I hate people with low test scores/gpa just because they're black. And on top of that they get money for being their. So congratulations R.D., you've made me into a racist.
6778	 1- What did I say?! How dare you accuse me of racism, like I was against your progress. 2- Be careful what you wish for To protest racism you also need to have racism. The fact that you ca not disprove racism is exactly why there are people that wish to be politically correct about it.

6789	 Marriage is legal because it makes it easier for people to raise children and distribute property, and therefore should not be made a business.  it makes it difficult to divorce.  I believe marriage should be treated as a life-time commitment - a marriage is not something you plan on doing... As others have said, how are you able to say you want to be married?  You get into a happy relationship because of the support of friends, family, and of each other.  We all want to think we are happy in that relationship because of self fulfillment and satisfaction.

6791	No. society is typically listed as a convincing choice and follows the same format.

There are unfortunately not enough women willing to raise a baby, and abortions would seem to be a necessary solution to the problem. In regard to abortion, are you against it because you think it's part of the solution, or is it because it's a violation of people's right to choose?

I suppose I'm not the only one who is upset with this entire idea of booze and birthdays, a very important part of our lives in general.
6839	Therefore, if we want to bring back the 20th birthday, we'd want to double it to have a celebration 40 years after 20. The first thing that the policy should do is raise the legal drinking age to 36 and implement it immediately. That way, there would be a 40-year period to come up with a time that we celebrate our 40th birthdays.  I'd now remove the reference to the "forties".

6873	Actively seek out and support the administration of any form of public access to the methods of execution. Even more important is supporting reforms that actively reduce the number of individuals on the parole system when they should be released.  Conspiracy theorists can occasionally access state statistics for different states. Going back to that time in the 1530s, a group of 'reformed' people wanted to overturn the practice of hanging on capital victims and wanted to do it a more humane way. They did that by creating something called the Act of Grace. This was a wonderful method that could allow for capital victims to be spared from hanging. In simple terms, the Act of Grace allowed individuals accused of murder to have an appeal and spare them from hanging. In this way, the individual still lived and there would be no need to have their body impaled by a pike and impaled on one of the capital trees. They would later be brought to a public place of execution as a form of parting. I heard this in the news and thought

People know that science is advancing and technology is developing and that technology sometimes causes problems and can be dangerous. It is at this stage that we still don't know enough to say what life will be like in 2100. Our interpretation is that technology has a lot of benefits but also problems.

6883	Axx, you know more than me but the arguments are on the premise that climate change is global in nature. The arguments assume that a majority of the population lives in populated areas prone to natural calamities, is populous enough to face the consequences of climate change. The argument assumes that climate change will mean drought, floods, sea level rises, epidemics and such etc.
6884	 Will climate change pose a threat to future generations of humans? Interesting. We don't know what to expect. For historical times and in all the ages we've ever known, humanity has seen natural disasters turn themselves into large disasters as they didn't happen enough in the natural world. But it seems that natural disasters will move into our living space with climate change. Because we don't know and will probably never know the answers to the climate change scenarios, we could be operating under a  pessimistic mode. Should be able to read out from this example of the misinterpretation of "don't know enough to predict" in this tweet: http://www.wisdomforclimate.org/article/12/Facts-about-climate-in-action/ Don‚Äôt know enough to predict ‚ÄúClimate change may put future generations in great danger.‚Äù
6885	And think the brushing of teeth will have already cleaned everything up. Sneed! Yes, we are going to sit down. The panic that was pulling me into the bathroom has obviously never come along, I had taken care of it. My fears are invalidated, I am now quite sure. Sneaky. Do you really think that women are going to tell you? Irrelevant. Men are for old gentlemen over 50 - I'm not. No doubt we're not going to end up in a relationship as we both would rather not, but if not for that I'm probably not to worried. My needs are met, until the next time someone would tell me that I'm too old to do that. The next day I will certainly not sit down to urinate, and definitely not while brushing my teeth. No, it is completely fine not to do that. It isn't because you are too old that you shouldn't do it. The enemy. It's ridiculous.
6886	It is not something that young boys try to do because of its gayliness. It is a biological necessity. That's what grown-ups do. Arguing with nature. It is not a character trait in men, just a biological fact of life. It's actually believed that male humans have to have sexual intercourse every four hours to increase their sperm count and protect their own sperm, and at least one half of all couples do eventually let one member pass out while they are either both asleep or doing other things for at least that long.
6887	He must be gay. Why does he think he has to do something that is considered feminine? Perhaps he thinks men will think less of him if he doesn't. Don't let those mentalized stereotypes get to you. If men always wanted to do that, they would be doing it every time they needed to. If you think it is a good idea, do it, no issues with that. Women get STDs by feces every day. Men get STDs by their semen. Standing up toilets are safer. You will never know what's coming in.

Don't do it! don't pee on the toilet floor, don't pee while you're sitting with the john,  don't pee standing up if you don't have to. like standing up to pee does that make you so much better. But I don't pee on the floor that much, it just kind of does that.
6890	  I'm gonna look into these in depth.. bang my head against a concrete wall probably. haha hehe as it stands , I guess there's a place for that , but I don't think it's something that I'd commit to being done by someone else.

Just   be    happy    but I believe I am attractive but really wishing to get procedures done to achieve my goal I have gone through above for . For me I have a pretty average face I'm not ugly but I do think it can be dramatically better and I really want to become much more attractive I am trying to  a Jowgrow pe on ASAP!! Using above info along with levels of attraction xxx
6892	  I'm a really young male (19) but I am seriously considering having a rhinoplasty, chin , jaw and cheek augmentation. I would never say that I'm ugly but I am pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done I will become dramatically more attractive/handsome more girls will check me and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face(and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
6893	 I'm a pretty average guy considering I'm still 18 but I know there are other attractive , beautiful guys out there. I'm just interested in this area because I really think that aesthetic surgery or cosmetic surgery really work. So I hope there're many other people my age like me .   Many people considered him average, but he really believes that cosmetic surgery could boost his confidence. He will use it as leverage to pursue modeling.

6895	Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! That is freaking ridiculous! This guy has crazy-stuffed talent! Just to bolster his argument I would instead say, this man has the better arm muscles, doesn't choke or gag your opponents (as choking gags can happen), is able to move at higher speeds with higher skill checks than any of his opponents, stomps and punches harder than any of his opponents, and he is able to do all of this without feeling any pain!!

I doubt anyone will care that he's a ninja, too many are just fans of Kool-Aid who can't handle the truth.

Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja.

It seems to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...) also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism
6906	I'm 30, and it's already crazy to constantly send American troops abroad instead of spending that money on housing, food, education, health care and low wage jobs... how is it even any more reasonable for us to send troops abroad because of 9/11? Obviously these days the U.S. military industrial complex is at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory, the "war" will never end. It also seems like a political tool to the right wing of the Democrat party to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people and into choosing the most hawkish neo-con Democrat into office to spend even more money on military adventurism.

For almost a decade after 9/11, we were given the excuse to at war with terrorism since the "war on terror" was the fantasy and excuse for losing economic efficiencies and our nation's wealth.    The consequences for two decades have been endless war and a continued cycle of the military industrial complex destroying the very idea of patriotism.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very specific definition of terrorism so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be terrorism in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 300's of years...). It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism. To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
6909	 What about country size? We can look at it like this - there have been 40 countries in all - it's been even smaller for the next 40. We can make the argument that the new industrial revolution provides money for education and smart projects that would create jobs. The trade war will work wonders for U.S. and all the other countries. We can enact a trade war with other countries, and we can protect and empower our citizens. As US-China relations improve, that a matter of time.

6921	 The impact of a crime on its victims is a challenge i am still working on. Reflection: I agree with the writer, that "it is better to be mediocre than to avoid having bad things happen to you." In fact, the social void created by criminals (not the perpetrator in this story) is what motivates bad things to happen to the victim(s). The man who produced this reflection does not choose to think about the issue of impact of a crime or crimes upon victims. The writer's "position" is for him to think about it or confront it. We were watching the soccer game, I think, but never mind.

6925	 Europe In geological terms Europe is a continent. There is no major division between Europe and Asia. Europe just happens to be located on the Eurasia continent.

6935	Everyone has the right to privacy and the freedom to view porn in private when they like. People will view porn under this context if they're not harming anyone and they have no intention to do so.  Obviously view porn in public does not constitute the basis for an official complaint.

6940	Yes, of course, more species could be discovered on our own beautiful planet. Long before we were able to create living things on this earth. Abundance of things on our planet is amazing, and fascinating to many people. The diversity and abundance of life on earth are truly one of the reasons we are here, and it's absolutely ridiculous if you consider it from the point of view of religion, that there are a limited number of species for creatures living on this planet.

6942	 Unfortunately no life could live where there would be any kind of division and concentration of power, since we would all be powerless to resist it. This means if you would ever, event in the distant future, find yourself being a "smart" living on a sentient world, no such entity would be able to make power and gain control in a manner that would allow you to equate yourself with other beings in its power, though could build enough technology to possess the means of minimizing it and get to the place where there would be lesser weakness and options.
6943	 We do not. A being capable of being a sentient life form would still be inferior to us, because it would need to gain those things for us. It might be greater or inferior in intelligence to us for we humans we do not create equal sentient life forms. We are capable of it, but our ability to create a sentient being equals our ability to create a machine, or a dog or a cat.
6944	 From everywhere it looks as if the term "God" itself, is a limited and misconstrued concept, even among true believers who are part of this religion. God himself is neither real, nor a creator of the world. Religion is a human invention, poorly accepted for this reason. The "deity" is human created. It is also a false illusion, or the simple idea of a person born from a placenta with no parents.

6947	Although he is famous, he died of drug abuse. There is no doubt. He was murdered. The best thing about his death is that he was finally dead. Kurt Cobain may well be one of the greatest musicians of all time. His songs were catchy, he wrote a lot and is relatively easy to remember. However, his death due to heroin addiction was horrific and one to which no amount of drugs, buried or not, could have prevented.

6955	 In the North Korea crisis, the US can make the sure that America's armies are in their back room ready,and if you see evidence the military power of this country, the US will launch them on the bad guys.  If China takes the step of arms prohibition or massive confrontation, that could be seen as a threat to US's national interest and the military might.     Public XHIP
6956	 After all, China is considered as a democracy with a market economy. It is nothing the US can compare with. However, China is a communist state, so they have certain ideologies. Even if the sanctions exist, the Chinese government can still negotiate with them to make a peaceful solution.
6957	 Jap√£o possui cerca de 2.700 islands. What is the third largest island in the world that is not US territory? Who knows? Maybe proving Jap√£o with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer?
6958	 If the U.S. bombs China, it would have to deal with the consequences. Just imagine a nuclear missile war. It would not be good for the U.S. or the rest of the world. Who knows if a U.S. attack would even bring about a buffer country.
6959	 Let the central government in China determine how to punish North Korean leaders. Move to the next case. The central government in China should punish the leaders of North Korea with more force.  That's probably the best idea.  We can't force the China to react to what is going on, but it's better to submit to them than to have them use nuclear weapons. Move to the next case.
6960	 Allow the other person to be who he or she is and accept yourself as well without making any adjustments and being open to them if you want to accept them either. Allow the other person to be who he or she is and don‚Äôt concern yourself if he really doesn‚Äôt exist so long as he doesn‚Äôt talk about something you find acceptable or reasonable.
6961	Be fair, trust that he‚Äôs not fully to blame for his ideas and don‚Äôt be angry with him when he expresses them. Why might someone else hold their opinion too strongly? What do you think? How might this person be doing you a favor by clarifying his thoughts?
6962	Well, in my opinion, when we start listening to someone, we should understand his thoughts, after that come up with our own, even if it's opposite from him. To be logical or not, it does not matter if it's acceptable or not; otherwise he might get some strength to do that.
6963	 Everything has the right to have his own opinions, to be open about them, and to speak out loud his own thoughts, logical or not, and if anyone doesn't agree, they may listen to him or not. They also have the right to come back with their own ideas and opinions or to simply neglect him like if he doesn't exist.
6964	Honestly, everyone has the right to spread his idiotic ideas but still has no right to spread his racist ideas. Of course racist people are hateful. The fact that one would enjoy reading racist ideas is not the point.
6965	If the Christian faith is true, the surly it is good gambling to place your eternity in the Christian faith. But I would not use Pascal's wager. Then, that is all I have to say. Pascal's wager doesn't say one thing either way

6967	 The Christian faith, when true, is good if it prompts believers to place their eternity in the faith. There are good arguments for other religions as well, so the author is not solely burdened by the success of just one religion.   Comments:  - It is not an argument for the Christian faith - It is logically coherent - It has persuaded some people Pascal's wager
6968	 What if the Christian faith is true? If the Christian faith is true and a person is operating from that foundation then Pascal's wager is good.  ### Edit:  What if Christianity is true, the surly it is good gambling to place your eternity in the Christian faith.  
6969	Change ‚ÄúThe Christian faith is true and a person is operating from that foundation‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Christian faith is true and one is operating on that foundation‚Äù to make the English translation more clear. From ‚ÄúThe Christian faith is true and a person is operating from that foundation‚Äù

6972	However, I strongly disagree with the idea of euthanasia. Euthanasia is a crime against humanity and is sadistic, but I don't think it should be available as an option. However, medical professionals should be able to assist them with the process if they really want to. I still think that people need to be able to be free and choose if they would like to take the risk that euthanasia would take. my mother is the first person in this country to request Euthanasia from her Pain Management Specialist.

6974	 We can talk about this topic: Euthanasia is the act of hastily ending a person's life because of their suffering, by causing pain or other unbearable distress that causes them to die. Euthanasia makes sure that you have a fair, humane and comfortable death by avoiding the agonizing pain of inpatient or institutionalization, but still allowing people to die quickly and peacefully.

6987	 I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty awesome device. I'm not sure what the device or procedure is called, but what you wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain, and through a series of nerve impulses, electrical thingies "scientific term", you can hear. It's not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries.  They are working on something similiar for eyes, but it is much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.

6990	 Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. Introduction. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world. Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added.
6991	Debates can be based on convincing evidence or not. It really is not important whether debates are based on evidence or not. What is more important is that these debates are based on rational deliberation and humility. So what matters is if any other reasonable arguments are made and they tend to convince the argument that supports evolution, then that evidence is the evidence and that is the evidence that the debate has to be based on. Asking, "Is creationism supported by any evidence? No
6992	 Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world. Evolution is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advancement. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.
6993	 arguments raised in support of creationism. This creates the impression that only a minority of scientists support the view that modern life on Earth originated on the basis of a single historical event. This suggests that scientists are unable to reach consensus about origins. Even more importantly, this statement implies that creationists have comprehensive control over science. Fundamentally, creationism is therefore a political philosophy rather than science or science education, and it should not be funded by the public purse.
6994	What they believe Evolution to be because they think it is better in a scientific standpoint. Evolution is a theory proposed to explain the development of life on Earth, while creation is based on ancient stories. However, they also believe that creation can be proven to be true in scientific terms. Due to the vast amount of time humans have existed on Earth, there has been time enough for the data from the fossils to accumulate to support a theory that we hold today.

7000	 No...I don't believe this is absolutely necessary. Maybe if our nation used the countries flags as a symbol for our country rather than the military..   BINGO  No.....I think we shouldn't force it. Have people choose if they are patriotism. Also, school is not meant for that sort of thing! School should be an environment to expand their minds. Since my experience in school was quite different, probably not only will I have to support it, I will probably now view the people who chose to have the song sung in school in a different light. No
7001	No....I feel like we should make something more creative and just leave this to people. Because I'm not sure that        Disciplinary action should be removed for using religion in a productive manner.      People in school should be able to take a class and choose if they want to be religious or atheist and shouldn't have to bring that to school.  That is why I am saying that I don't think        PoA should be taken out of school
7002	Yes...I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period. I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religions. I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religions. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religions.
7003	 School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.  The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) No.5
7004	Yes...I support the removal of prayer from school. That's something that shouldn't be a part of schools. That needs to go into homes where students and parents need to decide. That's my opinion. And I'm not a big fan of religious bias education because I want students to feel free to question everything else. I support removing religious references. That's my belief. I would also support altering lyrics so that they could be more in line with the same tone.

The writer apparently ordered the 'Burger N' Cheese' -- the below takes on a slightly different flavor profile, but is still not consistent with the original review.

Food was good. I'm sure my husband liked it as well but I didn't taste the food that well so I wrote a review of my experience while watching the staff attentive to a person in a wheelchair.

I chose to write this review because we also witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress literally read her the majority of the menu until she found something she wanted. Her waitress was patient and attentive.
7039	Went to Cafe84 for brunch. Ordered the steak and salmon combo which I thought was delicious. The staff made the experience enjoyable and memorable. I highly recommend this cafe to anyone who likes culinary creations.

7051	  Restaurant Jardin Panos specializes in a la carte food for diners. In general, dishes are based on traditional Greek food, but occasionally pieces of interesting new ideas pop up. The restaurant serves both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. It holds some outdoor events such as concert and provides a garden and bar. Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth.

Lasagnes fit better in people like Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. We'll add lasagne to another restaurant. It‚Äôs best to add lasagne to someone who isn't from Perdition.
7053	 'Splendid Smoked Meat Papicha Brochette, OYWA XOXO!\n\nWhen compared to Garden Panos, one thing this dish brings a little personality and flavor is: the Frenchbread. When you cut into the dish, the flavor of the meat and the breading combine.\n\nI really like to see bold, contrasting flavors on a dish. Something equally good is achieved with (whiskey) smoked meat papicha (pepper bread). The pepper and meat come in a good contrast with the sweeter and smoother bread.

7060	The argument is unjustified as it simply doesn't work. It is possible to adhere to a school uniform, or not to.
7061	Argument 2 - Academic Uniforms Cause Deprivation of Individuality   Fuzion: Other than the vital fact that under no circumstances should students in schools go against their personality, a uniform dress code in schools may be more convenient and safe to reduce casualities.
7062	Still another reason presented against school uniforms is that they restrict socialization. It is claimed to be a vital aspect of human nature.
7063	The dangers of school uniforms are a popular topic of debate. It is claimed that a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration, but it is also claimed to restrict socialization
7064	Consider the other side of the story. Despite its shortcomings, school uniforms bring discipline, unity and harmony to the classroom. It takes years to achieve unity, but once achieved it provides a closer bond among students that will last their entire lifetime.  The original argument did not discuss the effect school uniforms have on unity, socialization and the bond among students.

7076	 i dont think its a good idea to keep restrictions becoz thats just going to make students especially teens more hungry for fashion .its better 2 feed them than keeping them hungry.and once they r away from these restrictions,we will c d othr side of them which is way worse with no morals.so alow people 2 b free with their personalities instead of stoping them.
7077	obvious they always go back to school and get more.there is no fear. :) no restrictions is my choice.because when people get into school that includes a spot in fashion line is.
7078	 Food is cheaper and most children can afford. the article about it tells us its more important than fashion, so why should there be restraints? food and clothes shouldnt be both.
7079	 Yes these not good idea to keep restrictions becoz i think 2 thats just going to make students especialy teens more hungry for fashion.its better 2 feed them than keeping them hungry.and once they r away from these restrictions,we will c d othr side of them which is way worse with no morals.so alow people 2 b free with their personalities instead of stoping them.

7114	Wrong! Like the hen that cackles at the bird that crows, so is a mockery to its imitation the bird that crows at its imitation. The hen cackles as it sees the crow crowing, and not vice versa.
7115	That's true and I should never choose the path of loving a lousy father. If I want to stay healthy and focused on the life I want, I shouldn't choose the way of loving someone who doesn't care for me.
7116	 yes fatherless is better I would rather be fatherless because then i have someone to look up to . Thats better than having a terrible father . It just would not look good for me .
7117	I have been raised with a fatherless mother. I'm now married, but my wife wasn't the woman I fell in love with and she turned out to be nothing like her mother.
7118	I don't care if I have a brother - I want a father who is very devoted to me. I'll care more about my brother than I will about him
7119	 I would rather be fatherless. having someone to look up to be better to me than having a uncaring and lousy father to be a stain in my life
7120	 I would rather be "fatherless" then having a lousy father because a lousy father is not a good father and can show bad behavior in the family. A good father is supposed to set a good example and teach his kids the values they need in order to grow up to be strong.
7121	 Of course, but if the father for some reason is out of the house or works more hours then I might feel lonely with no one to look up to to raise my younger siblings. That is why this might happen even if your father happens to be out of the house and at work.
7122	 I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
7123	After rewriting: I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
7124	if my own father were a lousy person then I would rather be fatherless... let me be the man of the house, even if I had younger brothers or sisters. My father's not the man of the house, let me be the man of the house.
7125	 Think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
7126	 No father always being lousy wouldnt be fair to a child and wouldn't be helpful no father being respectable would be a benefit to them if the child weren't to have such a father wouldn't be so beneficial either way its better not to have a father I believe
7127	 They are choosing the middle option. A lousy father that they can learn from, but they still need a father. they want a father that is decent. They want a good father, but they don't want a great father. they don't want to be regulated by their father as they grow up
7128	 50. Do not be angry with a father for wanting you to grow up in a quiet setting. 50. Do not be angry with a father for wanting you to grow up in a quiet setting. 250.3.4: There is no point having a father if he is a lousy father
7129	 his father. father figures should teach us the important things. parents should always take care of their children and help them grow up and lead a good life. Dad can teach us important skills. having a good father is better. It's better to have a father figure in your life, and also leads to a better growth and life.

7150	p.e. helped him this week!!1 Kids are fat this week hehehehe  # your code here
7151	 Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!are!
7152	Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!one!!!! and itll help them relize music is important for there lame ass futures lol
7153	 Kids will be fools if they do not worry about their bodies because they have access to ALL this junk food!!!!!!1!!!!!one!!!!
7154	Let me share with you a slang line to say how much you love kids, lol  If kids are fat I help them understand health is important for their lame ass futures!
7155	 I think its not so bad. the kids kids are most likely overweight now because they are healthy enough, they eat according to the reality of their size, and exercise enough.  Most likely some peoples answers will not be on the right lines. no matter.
7156	 You don't have to do that. feel free to eat pizza as much as you want.
7157	 [u'you must help them'] = u'they are not healthy and should change their eating habit, they should avoid sugars and fatty
7158	I think it shouldnt be manditory to get them to eat healthily. in fact if it makes you feel better, they may find it rewarding.  ### Education
7159	 you should work out. maybe that is where  is the problem but i think it definatley should be manditory. when you look on to the streets at kids playing they are most likley over weight because they eat to much and dont get enough physical exercise.
7160	 Singapore needs reforming according to Raffles only dreamt about.
7161	Yes. Say no. No. No. No. No. No. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. No
7162	With his powerful persuasions, Singapore was taken over by Britain
7163	At first, Singapore was nasty, but Farquhar spent a lot of money building that area, so it looks quite nice today. Raffles was
7164	 Raffles did little ground work but Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore.  We ended up with sentiment( benefit_symbols.ann
7165	William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. Only because Raffles left to govern another country, Singapore continued to exist. Raffles left to govern another country.
7166	 #code here  William Farquhar was great because he wrote "Far Cry 4
7167	Now the world's quickest country to come into existence was Ireland, not Singapore. Singapore's island was both smaller and less populated than Ireland's.
7168	If William Farquhar had been murdered, Singapore would have perished.
7169	 Without William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. How different it would have been if William was there to govern the country. Singapore would have become one of the most powerful countries in the world. Raffles left to govern Singapore.
7170	Violence, exposure, and sexual assaults need to stop and we all need to know what's going on in this country as it's occurred to us. To better understand, we need to learn from the experiences of victims.
7171	They couldn't vote because it didn't exist in 1981, and that we don't live in a perfect democracy so its impossible to get everything you want if you go to public outtakes. You'd have to wait until after 1983 until women could vote.
7172	 You don't know them history, but you don't know them story. It's up to them to stand up against racism and sexism. until then, they can like whatever they want to. So why the blame? As for sexism and racism, it is now a subject mentioned a lot, so yes, it may have occured in the past.
7173	Based on the reply, I understand that you may not have to like it, but you should have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter. Yes indeed it is easy for you to judge others on their personal property.

7175	The reason why evolution happens is because different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. The creatures that live most easily survive and in turn the evolution continues through natural selection. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution.
7176	evolution NOT THE CHOSEN WORD: evolution not the chosen word.  Insert Example, natural selection being the appropriate answer to help young students respond better (176 words)  ### Idea: The best way to explain evolution is using analogies or simile. Using simile or analogies offers many options to help students understand evolution
7177	 When we want to evaluate, keep in mind it is more conceptual (aka. based on controlled) experiments. This can still be considered experimenatl evolution. evolution can happen in plants, animals, humans, and so forth. evolution happens when one generation gets/seems more similar to next generation.
7178	You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution

7180	  Yes, yes, of course you're created in a few days, but you've been on this planet
7181	 We were created millions of years ago. It took a long time to evolve all the species on Earth.
7182	We were created in a few days.\n # the author doesn't understand the question anymore.

7185	When you don‚Äôt have any religion to believe in, evolution is more likely to occur. consequently, they believe in evolution. absolute excludes the possibility of evolution
7186	 your god may or may not exist, but if he does, he or she probably is NOT intelligent enough to exist this way. you know more about how intelligent gods/gods are than the scientists who study evolution.
7187	 think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. the weak die, the strong continue to breed. this strengthens the species. argument over.
7188	i believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing because creationism and evolution are not exclusionary.
7189	 vs.   vs. copy vs. i think that creationism and evolution are simply a lot of nonsense they say they believe seatless1 vs. creationism and evolution are nonsense. that is very true
7190	i assume yous would enjoy with a map-setting xmap_image porn.png :l
7191	whatever ? porn is a f**king way of life ? its the best f**king thing ever
7192	porn is a f**king way of life ? i bet yous any money that all the people on the yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins :L
7193	yeah, porn is a bad thing: whyever you'd say porn should be unaccepted with the virginal women:
7194	whatever ? on the other hand, no matter what you say, all the people on the yes argument who are virgins are seeing porn =) i bet you any money that all the people on the no argument on how porn is wrong are virgins
7195	 No porn should be much better I see. That just proves how crucial sex is in the wonderful world of babies.
7196	 We should not be in any other relationship after something like this because we're nasty. Like I don't think we should have kids with a person who masturbated.
7197	No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people think it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.
7198	 Some people may agree some maybe not but its ok to do as we want to
7199	 No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.
7200	 Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
7201	 A personal pursuit is a pursuit that only cares about oneself . A personal pursuit happens for example to some from college loan, orphanage etc. But for the common good there are people who can commit themselves
7202	There are both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include a lack of support at times, problems with being viewed as selfish, and a missing key to understanding the possibilities, plans, and habits.
7203	Or even do what the community expects you to do. Do a good thing no matter how many compliments you get. Look to the future and how bad things might get and try to do the right thing even if no one notices you. That is always a great thing to do
7204	 A personal pursuit is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
7205	     - another point - so what - more reflective to myself more reflective to myself - replace 'I' with 'we'
7206	 I would choose my personal pursuit. because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all
7207	While we are at it, that would be better than being stuck at high school is high school forever (as opposed to your personal pursuit).   original_message = 'I want to go to college if possible.
7208	 My personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
7209	 Advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
7210	 The way I see it, one should want to do their best, but in the end make decisions for themselves. The common good doesn't actually exist. I think most people are only selfish and make decisions for themselves more than anything else.
7211	The common good is good, but most people will think they are better than others. I believe everyone can go about improving themselves, but will always know little about others. and more likely are greedy and selfish than the rest of the population. Others will constantly think they are better than others.
7212	Wouldn't like it unless money changes it. Common good usually means the big picture for you, it's the benefits you get, using the least amount of resources to enjoy your life, but that requires knowing how much money you'll use, and therefore is rarely discussed because it doesn't interest most people.
7213	 You shouldn't be greedy, selfish, only care about what you want, and not care about what others want. There is no such thing as the common good. You should uplift everyone, and help them move out of their lairs to the common good.
7214	 Wield great power. Bring loss or gain as you will. It is only power that counts. A loss would be ultimately not having fun or a gain would be a massive bounty. Bring loss as you would. You are the god of war.
7215	 Yes, I would wear the uniform, but only within a reasonable amount of grades/ activities/ resources involved. It‚Äôs good in most cases, but not just because everyone else has it. If the family can‚Äôt afford uniforms I wouldn‚Äôt use my time as a teacher to stand for equality.
7216	 I think it's good. while at school, because otherwise there would be too much friction and it would be far less stressful. But, it also depends on when you end up here. Now, I argue that people should just skip school for a day, when it gets really bad, because your future means to little. So it's the perfect balance.
7217	I don't think my claim is well articulated. If we were to not allow the socks, it would defy aesthetic principles. In my experience, school uniforms make us more friendly and easier to work with.
7218	I'd rather have a classy uniform for school and try to look nice rather than going to school in something that I feel shitty in. I'd rather never have made this the reason I didn't get into school. Feel free to criticise my argument.  I don't want people to feel bad for not having enough money or being poor, so I thought uniforms were good.  There are many things that uniforms can be used for, but that I haven't had the chance to think about yet. I'd rather have a classy uniform for school and try to look nice rather than going to school in something
7219	I think it's a great thing in an ideal world. I feel like the school that I went to gave me a more forgiving environment where we weren't as tight as other colleges. I don't think we had any problems at all and I feel bad for other colleges where people are stressed because they are worried about looking good.
7220	unless you want to sit still doing nothing such as homework you should talk and express the emotions
7221	 what is wrong is not polite and not constructive may be
7222	 Please follow the proper school code and learn a new better school code
7223	 overtime work right by being there  as much as possible
7224	 arguments in line with proper school code and the right to express are
7225	So yes, a uniform is good, especially for school. It's cheaper, and you don't have to go shopping so regularly. Without further ado, enjoy my answers, and good luck! Yes, a uniform is good, especially for school. It's cheaper, and you don't have to go shopping so regularly.
7226	 This argument involves reformulating what each claim means to make it more applicable to the specific situation at hand. If we leave the original argument one change and apply these steps. a Some important things to consider in this situation:
7227	Are uniforms good? Yes, in schools uniforms would be good. This is part of the reason why I don't wear t-shirts and sweaters. It can get hot or cold here in Utah and snow is not that rare for fall as well. However, I am against school uniforms for females.
7228	 student uniform policy It should be positive to bring school uniforms into schools. The argument given is contradictory, so I made it less controversial in discussion. It does not justify a choice to wear a uniform, but is just trying to find an alternative
7229	 uniforms are good. In school should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
7230	I think that this can be prevent envy and jealousy.
7231	I will like to respond that uniforms prevent being aggressive. This can be prevent envy and jealousy
7232	Right, because many students don't have any proper clothes and uniforms can help them.
7233	I believe the policy is great. Uniforms make students equal on an economic level This can be prevent envy and jealousy.
7234	Some students feel uncomfortable on an economic level while wearing uniforms Other students consider them equal
7235	 Going on vacation with my family would be better than being fatherless. Going on vacation would be fun, and during the vacation I could stay with my family and make plans to do all kinds of nice things.
7236	Having a Lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a Lousy father you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.

7240	Having a father who is not bad or abusing is better than having no father at all. Having a father who is very much bad or abusive would still be better than having no father at all. You really don't know how great your father is until he is gone and never coming back.
7241	 And then there were two sons... Hey, they are already content with having lousy fathers. You should try being lousy. Then you would not have to cope with what a bad father does to the sons.
7242	When it comes to family its always better to have a close family that can understand you than to have a faceless bunch of strangers. Whoever your father, it would be better to have a close family or family that can understand you, rather than lousy family
7243	 I would be happy if your father gave in and would sit down and talk with me with me about fatherhood problems and how I would actually teach him to be better at his job as a dad. Ideally, the father should actually teach you, and not make you learn to take it easy on him or do as he wants

7285	In about 5 days the dog will be dead and so won't be able to marry. With the social media age, kids will take care of parents when they die. If that happens, then kids will grow up to be unmarried and this will end the cruel epics of marriage. As people go through this process of dying it can be really good for the self-fulfilling prophecy of the dictates of society about marriage (yet, actually, having the healthy life and relationships that we have). The beliefs that society has is that marriage is hard work and dating is easy. So, the society is incentivizing
7286	I wouldn't know much about caring about my spouse or kids, how much I would care about each of my spouses kids depends on who they are, as does my relationship to my spouse, and how much I would care about this kid or the one if for another kid.  What is the greatest value of a marriage?  It depends on how much I care about the person I'm marrying
7287	 These couples should be legally separated from each other, but raise their children as independent adults. So that their children are separated from each other as well. So that their children are separated from each other as well.
7288	 The definition of marriage could probably be the following (it would become the first line in the program): marriage is about family responsibility and two individuals meet by mutual consent and settle on the long-term relationship.

Yes, they made a stupid mistake here. Did you mean that gay marriage can increase AIDS transmission? Yes
7291	Yes, gay marriage may help reduce AIDS (I think) more that just by reducing AIDS transmission. Or it could just mean having a partner with health that is a good reference for other partners. gay sex _is_ bad. It doesn't have anything to do with UNPROTECTED ANAL sex.

7295	 There are no man/woman relationships, only man/man and woman/woman relationships. Separate schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "distinct and different." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.

7297	 The law must address man's relationship to man and woman's relationship to woman. Handle a single school location specifically for woman in a way that does not require a separate school location. Dismissed. cancellation of the technicality of separate schools being necessarily required for homosexual people is a significant victory and proves that a "marriage act" is needed if the law is to contemplate man's relationship to man and woman's relationship to woman....

7299	The reasoning for having separate but equal assumes that same-sex marriage would be possible and that people will be free to marry whoever they want. This argument focused on relations between people and their one and only partner. We can only assume that the same will be true for people married to a single homosexual partner.
7300	Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.

7302	Yes. I totally agree with India. Once the government can look after its 28 states, what it need to do is not a problem and what they need is to keep the country safe and happy. Many times politicians have a dream about being the best country in the world.

7320	It is a good thing that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is a limit to everything so they shouldn't use spanking every time the kids do something wrong.
7321	I think parents should use spanking but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
7322	Parents should only use spanking as an option. This limit is set so they shouldn't use it all the time to discipline kids.
7323	I think parents should not use spanking to discipline their kids but they shouldn't use it if they mess up because it is not useful for them.
7324	I would prefer parents to use praise and reward when it comes to discipline instead of just spanking, although it is an option they should use when necessary.

Islam cannot be that evil as certain here are some or too much of them who portrayed their faith in unconvincing ways, for an irreligious person or atheist to support any faith or religion.
7329	 My religious beliefs does not help me in any way in the world. - As I heard the arguments, I really had to think about my religious beliefs. As I grew tired of arguments, I gave up my belief as to the existence of God but I never gave up on my beliefs. - The only problem I have is that the onslaught of atheism in the country that no amount of reasoning and debate could solve. - Since

7346	It is also unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were bullied growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not bullied growing up who become good or even great adults.
7347	It is necessary, since it affects how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
7348	Like so many other kids, my child could very well just put me up for a spanking. Instead, he will put up with my childishness and scold me instead.
7349	It is important in knowing how a child develops into an adult, but it is not crucial. There are some children who are spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who are not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.

7361	No I don't think about it that much, you never know. Yes, because I think if a person really loved and lived with someone, they would be supportive of them if they became a murderer.
7362	Yes, I am convinced they did. Yes, I would go to the police if I knew they murdered someone.

7444	You should work on your English better. If you wanted to sue someone for a mistake you would sue for the cash amount lost. Pay attention to the person who did this to you and see if you can agree on a payment.
7445	Yes, she does not get custody, you will need to have either the child's guardian permission and a court ordered agreement. Ask for visitation and visitation alone for the woman with a remanded order. Ask for custody. Ask for child support. Go to child support. Go to the support of court services and fill out the petition. Ask for documentation. No, she does get custody. Yes, she is entitled to visitation. No, he does not get custody. No, he doesn't get custody, unless there was a custody order. Yes, he does not get custody. No, she does not get custody. Yes
7446	Yes  Boyfriend: To walk away from her would be a good option. Boyfriend: I wouldn't regret it though. Boyfriend: You know what may help now? Boyfriend: If you'd bring your lawyer. Boyfriend: Yup. Boyfriend: That could be something great. Boyfriend: You may need that lawyer to do the parenting plan for you if you want to go for sole custody, for child support and more. Boyfriend: I know there is that stipulation in the marriage agreement, so I don't think you could do it yourself. Boyfriend: So, if you want I could meet with your lawyer to find out about it. Boyfriend: I'd be glad to. Boyfriend: I don't want you to regret anything. Boyfriend: You need to figure out what you'd like to do for her. Boyfriend: I don't know what to say, time will tell. Boyfriend: What would you want to do? Boyfriend: Try this, the first time will be the worst Boyfriend: You should still have custody, it's your granddaughter but you want to take her out of her environment now. Boyfriend: No worries. Boyfriend: She gets what she needs  and will not let her do anything. Boyfriend: I'm sure she wouldn't. Boyfriend: I know her too well. Boyfriend: That's how I feel.
7447	Yes Yes if you feel he is doing more damage than good by being involved in her life, you have the right to ask for sole custody.  This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order in place as far as visitation. My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first. If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. Again, this may take some time.
7448	Yes the whole time. No"? No"  Yes"  Yes" / No" Yes"  Yes" No" No" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" No" No" Yes" No" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" No" No" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" No" Yes" No" Yes" No" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" Yes" No" Yes" Yes Yes" Yes" Yes
7449	Yes, you have the right to ask for sole custody. Yes, he will be financially responsible for child support and visitation. Yes, child support will be automatic. Yes, your daughter needs physical and mental care. Yes, I can't make any guarantee you will get sole custody, but you do have the right to ask for it. Yes, a potential dad can use this document to present to a judge to get sole custody. Yes, he should do so. Yes, so don't get discouraged. Yes
7450	 hey look, you're less quiet than i imagined in here, it really doesn't take anything for you to ramble, but if you want to make your point i think we're ready, are you?
7451	 Good! the effects from "weed" are far less than the effects of alcohol, if it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people to use harder drugs! and people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go thru all the garbage they need to now for relief!!
7452	 Yes!!! the effects from "weed'' are way less than the effects of alcohol. If it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people to use harder drugs!
7453	yes!!! this would make a lot of no alcohol addicts go cold turkey on drugs like cocaine! with lower prices!!  Note: using possible , this code would give a more appropriate and useful result. weed is legal but supply is an issue, but if some kind of quota was established this code would produce a much better result  yes!!! the effects from "weeds" are far less than the effects of alcohol, if it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people
7454	no!!! the effects from "weed" are far more than the effects of alcohol, and they are addictive!!!   thus it's illegal!!!   ### Response (different): yes!!! the effects from "weed" are less than the effects of alcohol, if it was legal it would free alot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and i believe it would cause alot less people to use harder drugs!!!   while at the same time people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go thru all the garbage they need to now for relief!!

7456	yes. for things to change legally, people with official positions must make changes for you to make laws on. so it is not legal. but it is in your best interest that things change for the better for that is just one of the biggest things in life. there are other issues you can have on the same topic but that is just one of the biggest things, so yes, if you think the world could change for the better. if you think the world could change for the better than yes.

7460	 No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's better to stay away from that kind of temptation. See "Heard advice" for more information. Please explain. We lust after a woman with her clothes on and without her clothes on, but it's much easier to lust after a naked woman.
7461	No. He also said "like taking an alcoholic to a bar," so that's why it's not against God's law. Such anecdotes were made up by the early church fathers to make good points. So only find out after much research. I am trying to avoid those sources. :) You can take a naked woman to a brothel.
7462	God does not say that looking at naked women is a sin, although it is against his law to possess a premeditated lust for a naked woman. There are a lot of reasons to not do it. As much as you may like getting drunk, it is often considered better to stay away. Yes, because men find it easier to lust after naked women than women clothed.
7463	Jesus is the friend of prostitutes. Jesus is the friend of prostitutes. You can also see results in 20-year-old vids. Jesus Christ. Jesus: The Friend of prostitutes. Woooow! How do You balance that quote with the rex sex is hot that starts with HER (rexy rydal)? Jesus: You just never know. Jesus: You just never know.
7464	Answer is Does not sound right. It appears that "God" was referring to humanity and sex and the difference between adultery and lusting after another man. God is not a gender for humans. God is not a man. God is an honorific title. No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.
7465	$60 to fix his name (sadly, $60... no refund): you agree to pay the other guy $60 to fix his name, at the expense of half of your insurances premium in the future. It sounds pretty reasonable to me. Answer: You agree to pay $60 to fix his name. You get the full cost of your insurance for at least 6 months as a result.
7466	you do not have to pay the premium, even if you are financially responsible if it is not covered by your family plan. you have the right to decline. you have the right to decline, even if insurance is not covered, including death for car accidents. if your insurer files a petition to maintain coverage for you, you must co-operate. decline or accept coverage, depending upon the coverage limits as defined by your individual policy
7467	his problem is not yours. get insurance and pay the bill. he doesn't pay the bill, you might want to negotiate or appeal the ticket.  put it on your father. does he have insurance? if yes, back it up. if no, find out if you can get his policy changed. his policy might not accept your reservation. he might need proof that the traffic ticket was based on improper passing. test drive the car yourself. take pics of the damage, the ticket, or both. make sure to have a copy of the ticket in case your father wants to follow up.
7468	rather he should have worked on paying off his insurance. he is paying after all. if you had been at fault as well you would do the same thing. he made no mistake. they should not have been in front of a moving vehicle and they both own vehicles. he is just a friend. he did not let you use his. you don't see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
7469	 if your fathers insurance goes up you should pay it. it will probably get reviewed with in six months. however the good news is this is just lifes lessons learned.  you got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. she got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. lets assume there is a big doctor bill. you are probably insured on your fathers policy if you were at fault. your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. he let you use the car.  now if there is a big clain he is not insured because he didn't list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. this is his problem not yours. i don't see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
7470	homosexual couples, lesbians, etc. are common today, not just commonplace, but part and parcel of a civilised nation. many people have made it into the working world together, many more are having children together. who or what would want to disturb such an order. You're absolutely right not to resist, the coward will be motivated to find some way to turn him down. I have no doubt about that.
7471	Hi my name is Brody Thomas i am a counselor at work and i would like to be very clear here that this is more a legal issue than a relationship issue... Your boss is absolutely correct if he thinks that gender and race are issues for you to deal with don't give him your business
7472	text with the quote   ### Original text: Wow that had to hurt you alot. i Cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved. BUT i do not think you are. If hes not worried i wouldn't either. Sounds like his boss needs to get with he times and realize that gays, interracial couples, lesbians and most relationships are common place. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend that he will make a decision to find another firm rather than loose you. Good luck
7473	thank you SO much. i will contact my boss ASAP! i never knew. thank you so much. we have so much that we have in common. i know what to do! love you :) great advice.
7474	 i like the title of your blog! are you sure its true that son of a bitches sex was same thing as gay? so guys are sent to school with such a mindset?wonder who put such crap in their heads? you my younger sister could have saved a lot of headache! but you do love your ex. you two arent even close but you are mutual best friends that can talk to so do rest of the best friends. i know from talking to your older sister hes not gay.i believe you. dont be too quick to believe them.
7475	 "our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up"   epbx_example('understand the US "war on crime" and "war on drugs" since the late 70s')    response = "our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up"  epbx_example("the usual stuff is still on the menu", response=response)
7476	 ... THIS IS FULL OF ERROR AND NOT JUST A typo!!! ... IT'S A NEW ONES!!! NOTHING TO RELATE TO THE SUBJECT ... I agree with the dissidence in the matter. We have prison overpopulation issues, but not in the country of the US. figure out what this is supposed to mean and what the stats mean. you aren't to judge the statistics that you've read but to dissent of the person who wrote them. sentencing guidelines. the US is doing this through "less invasive" or more "invasive" methods of incarceration. take research & look up your own hypothesis. none of the above choices . anyone can misinterpret the sentences. you are more experienced than you don't know the difference.
7477	 We also score very poorly on this, so you still have a point.  Add a sentence explaining about this phenomenon to your essay. That number is 3000+ higher for crime rate for each 100,000 of population if you compare to other countries. These drugs need to be taken seriously by drug policy makers in this country so that crime rates in the US doesn't keep going up.
7478	 The U.S. is going to suffer greater problems due to this and many nations will likely want to do the same to improve their rates of incarceration and crime, and that will only continue to escalate the overall war.  There is also evidence that the current techniques of punishment used to solve these issues in the U.S. will not work as they attempt to continue to escalate the war and will only lead to more problems for government officials, politicians, and US citizens.  How bad does this make the U.S. worse off? worse

7480	Both sides argued and you agreed that you are indeed drunk. Disagree. You agreed that you were drunk but later decided not to drive. No appropriate response since the outcome is the same: you should take the test the next day to avoid a medical license suspension and this is for you to consider.
7481	No reaction from police: Today's procedure is to video tape your FST's. You will not be taken to court, but you will make a stupid face and think about what you are going to do.
7482	I want to encourage people to use the high-end Cingular wireless phone. The survey is done online and you can go to the conclusion website at www.survey.tccs.edu/cov.
7483	 You will take the test in the parking lot to replace the official FST.  You will be under the influence of alcohol and will be administered a roadside FST. You will pay \$80 for the test.  Then you will be rushed to the jail or the hospital.
7484	 It is your responsibility to make sure the recording system you use is compatible with FFmpeg. There is little, if any, to no chance the cameras could have picked up your FST's.
7485	Nah, this person is no good for me... might as well look for a new job. How can I possibly be with a person who doesn't respect my work and my success? I've learned my lesson and will never meet that person again.
7486	 You have been very impolite and the conduct has generated prejudice. The conduct is terrible. Put it in writing and send them a copy: "Manager: \n\nEmployee: Tom\n\nContent of the email:\n\nSample emailThis email has been sent to the address "myemail@domain.com"
7487	Yes, this is a bad idea. If you really wanted to pursue this you would have to take a contingency fee on it, which could come out to hundreds of dollars. Even if there was nothing to uphold your reputation, you would still have to pay to sue someone for damages.

It looks bad, or so you think. Disadvantage: you have done a bad thing, and you plan to be able to pay for it later, it's not about your "lesson" anyway, but about your mistake.
7490	from yeldman: He doesn't have a payable on death account, he has a liquid account. Bank wants Francesois to pay a fee of $800 if they don't transfer his money to his childrens account before Christmas as of 25th of December 2012. if they don't transfer his money to his childrens account, than Francesois can blame them for Bank  _
7491	Dear Friend,  The information above applies to every bank account with you as an account holder.  I wouldn't trust most bank accounts when you're alive in that situation.  Most of them are run by people that fail to honor or even, in some cases, care much about contracts, legal documents, account statements, wire transfers, or borrowing money against their own bank accounts. Generally, banks will always make things as hard as possible for debtors.  I've been in the banking business for over 20 years, and there's too much money to be made robbing innocent people.  To date, none of the adult/responsible children I've ever known would attempt to steal from their own parents or brothers, when they have the opportunity to work hard and earn a living. Any children would do their best to live up to their parents' expectations -- anything short of that is
7492	Dear Friend,  Do not let them do this.  A person listed as "payable on death" has ZERO interest in your account while you are still alive.  They just get any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive.  Let them know they'll get a lawyer if they don't change their tune -- and that it'll cost them a LOT more than $800.  Bank stealing money from innocent children?  Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
7493	Dear Friend,  They just got a notification from the bank that you've lost $800 more than they've ever lost before - from bank-robbers - in the last 5 years and I'm upset but I guess that's the life.   It's the right thing to do to at least make them work. Please let them know that the $800 you'll be returning will at least make their loan over. Thanks, Frank
7494	Dear Friend, We would appreciate if you could contact the lawyer Ms. Saliw. She will be able to recommend the correct solution.  She is qualified and experienced in debt collection. She is going to chase the thief from your bank account. This will free your money and would be your best solution. Emails cannot do anything. Instead, Ms. Saliw will contact you and advise you how to proceed. Do not get nervous.  Her number is +1 (87) 247-2817.
7495	 This woman may or may not be speaking for the actual mom, she might just be a bully. If the mom denies this and insists that you are not hurting your child, find another lawyer. No one should have to be put in a place of fear for protecting his or her child.
7496	 This is great advice!  I am sure a lawyer would tell me not to go straight for custody. They said fighting this will be tough, my sister‚Äôs and I would better off focusing on things like controlling visitation. Thanks! I need to find out more about what will be involved in the process and who I should contact. I will call a lawyer and talk about what's going on and start looking for funding.
7497	 Asking her ex: Is she properly dressed? Clean? Everyone seems to take great care of themselves: Make sure that she is well dressed, clean and presentable. It looks like her son likes her mom much more than me. They seem very settled in their lives together. Anyway, she is very attractive. She looks well as she is living and not after retirement. Now I am exhausted.
7498	 Because what you said is WRONG to me. The only way I can get custody of my daughter is if there are no parental figures in the immediate family and I have as much time with my daughter as I would like. If she comes to visit at home, with her mother, that is just not good enough. You are better off fighting that too. Fight everything about my custody and your money. That's the honest truth. Or better yet, try changing your statement entirely.
7499	 She may be doing harms to my child if: mother injured my child with some thing serious, mother stole something belonging to my child, mother gave something bad to my child or mother cheated the kids on anything. I am just trying to see if we can find some of the ways to get custody from her.
7500	 These comments and offers are just to thank you for taking the time to contact me. I feel terrible that you have had to see something like that in your neighborhood, in the school system. Unfortunate. Both of you have gone through a very difficult situation. You also provide excellent referral information. Thank you. The following text should be below the paragraph, and shouldn't be put at the bottom of the FAQ.
7501	Srs. Pay attention to this. I am concerned about the health of your son and I cannot find any reason why such cruelty might not be intentional. I sincerely feel your pain. I think you should speak with a  lawyer. Do not argue with your son and anger seems to have overtaken some of his sense of normal thinking. Please take care and try to discuss the problem with him more calmly. Try to be patient and I cannot explain why but he may come around in time.
7502	 Sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling
7503	 From your rewritten proof. A nine year old has to be removed from school for a few weeks so you can call if she is not totally lame. If it turned out she got hurt, you can file a case. Otherwise she has done nothing wrong and may be fully human. These statistics are overrated. She has done nothing wrong. He did not bully her, so she should be allowed to return to school.
7504	 I will speak to the mayor about this. I think he is the person to solve this. Unfortunately, there is no case in the school district because two superintendents are present, and they are brothers. It does not bode well for you to have all the power in the school district. Best hopes. Bulling has no excuse. The entire district would benefit if there was more leadership.
7505	 There are a few things that should be kept in mind, as all Arizona counties have their own rules and laws.  Your county court may be able to handle a claim for this if you follow the appropriate form filing and requirements.  If that doesn't happen, a court that is located in your county will receive the paperwork that you file here to send it to the court of AZ that will have jurisdiction.  This is not a simple case, but there are important facts to keep in mind.  If you have any questions about the best steps to take for filing for your dog back, talk to your attorney and get them to put together

7512	I voted No, Because women are not wanted in every other political position by force to the surface in this country to vote for the person who they should not vote for. Improve the drinking age.

7514	 I would give the answer below, but on multiple occasions for different purposes people have approached me and asked about why I changed my answer on the similar question. I refuse to provide the answers to different questions. I want to change the voting rule. Other than that, you could say: My dad is an adult, and my daughter is a teenager. He just drinks a lot, and I don't like it one bit. I would certainly vote to raise it,
7515	I am not trying to offend anyone, even very good people like you in here, you mentioned the underprivileged, even you, but all people who are born in America are considered America, because if the country is their country. You don't want to be around that sort of people because it makes you uncomfortable with respect, because in most cases they are poor and don't know how to say or do things you do know. Just as I would not want to be around someone with a poor/dirty accent, cause you to understand the their language is very good or use it, and because of the cultural habits they would get a different impression of me. Latino people are people, no one can call them Latinos and place a label to them. No use saying this is their culture, it is just lame.
7516	And they do indeed drive Teslas. How many Teslas can you name? 3. That number is quite small by Tesla standards. As for electric cars, I would bet that most EU countries allow their residents to drive it. As long as it is legal to do so. To each his own. Latinos are like all other nations, they drive cars. I can't say that one specific group is black.
7517	That is just lame excuse. You stay in your countries because of culture but you have to respect the customs and traditions of others if you want to move to another country. Respeting people is the best way to avoid problems. You can avoid potential racism by learning other people's customs. do this, you are just a hypocrite. Just forget it. You're just lazy and uninformed. You are just not knowledgeable.
7518	students, Latinos learn the English language from their parents who are native speakers, and because they don't get punished for speaking Spanish they often switch. Latinamerica is too large to mention just a single country, try American to become more specific. French people call themselves French rather than French Canadian because they are French and not half German. There are so many nations and cultures in the world and most try their hardest to avoid any sort of racism or insults.
7519	Not every Latin American is speaking Spanish. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest. That said, I support what you said that culture should not excuse mistakes. I can appreciate that your reasoning is sound. I respectfully disagree with you. Even though we think we speak the same language, there are other cultures that do, but we Americans never ask who speak the same language as us what is your culture.
7520	 Punishment that is similar to a two strikes and your shot system   I advise the SEC to remove any requirement that social media must be blocked   A call to Facebook and Twitter's general counsel and then an audit of their servers to ensure that they meet all SEC requirements would be in order.    Courts should use this logic when deciding on social media companies that have violated the law, as judged by SEC and broken all rules and regulations and yet somehow circumvented the penalties.    Perhaps the President would find it in his power to order individuals to pay the SEC to unblock them.     forcibly tech

We have to give him one more chance.  ### Significance: I realize punishment can only work if it has a positive side effect. So, we are going to punish the person but then give him a chance to succeed in life.
7522	I would use a "psuedotornado" as a form of recourse. This is dangerous and horrific to both your children and your family. It uses strong chemical energy, but it could possibly produce the desired result. A small percentage of people who were born with developmental conditions, where their brains still grow at that rate, but an everyday fly could easily flatten them with a spray bottle. I would hope that no drug company would sponsor this one, as advertisers don't like taking any risks.
7523	 He also causes great damage to the perpetrator without actually being experienced. An interesting point of view, but as a teen, I can see both sides to the argument. Try one. Try a combination. Try both. Try any combination.
7524	 Police should issue "shots in the head."  input "Shoot him in the head"   print "Successfully shot in the head, " + x.name + "."
7525	 Ooooooooooooooo! punishment for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we can't dole out retrihutive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.
7526	  It's hard to know. The first sentence was too broad and could be as short as, "Did you write this?"  The first sentence needs a better rewording to be more appropriate to the assignment. "Frankly, I don‚Äôt know why you would be assigned this. It doesn't apply to your profession."  As the original writer wrote it:  Q: My Reaction is R.N.S. no reaction to the issue before me.
7527	  I used their original assignment. It was a longer conversation. We needed to start with a thesis statement. This isn't the first time you asked me to critique your writing. So, you are welcome to critique my response. Although it was my first response. Please pardon my not-so-creative first paragraph. You were willing to take the time to sit me down to discuss this with me. I wish I had the time to do it again. I appreciate it.
7528	 We can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. Based on the assumption that the of Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance," it is necessary for a social definition of the social order to agree on the foundation of a social order. Rehabilitative theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabilitating the criminal to help him "re-enter society."
7529	  We can simply substitute: "criminals" ‚Üí "society" in the first sentence. Retribution is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining society's "harmony" or "balance."Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion. The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. The PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive. This is not a difficult enough question to require this many paragraphs. The process of defining the dimensions of harmonious society, or what it takes to create a balance of power and resources is Sociailly cohesive. The process of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is sociailly cohesive.
7530	It was disgusting that these people were doing all these things with the FEMA card (some even bought wide screen TVs while they were in the Cajun Dome for a shelter!) because of this abuse there are still hard working people out there that don't deserve to live the way they have to.\n\nIMPORTANT: As political campaigns go during the shutdown, this is simply not fair, and it needs to be taken seriously.
7531	For there to be more abuse or violence or homelessness, the government can't just let people go there and do this. They need to make their neighborhoods a bit safer, and take some of the crime out of the schools and try to help people with their moves and find them jobs to do at home. But if you do get wrongfully evicted, remember, you have the option of getting your housing revenue tax refunded until 2038!!!

7533	Seems as if you would want to target more people in better places that are less strained! Many people are not displaced, but when their home is destroyed they have to go elsewhere. Secondly, it is clear that the housing market is hot and flooded with applicants and there aren't enough housing options for them, so they take advantage of the high price. # target a better option, not the worse option or the government will get sued

7536	 @cc -- I don't think a person who lied about their part in a trial would be anything but responsible.  It's unethical -- I can't blame you for wanting to protect your rights.  Just do what's right.  I know it's not the right thing, but there are many things, and a trial is just one thing, that can be done wrong, and it doesn't change the fact that legally a person who lies in the course of a trial could be rewarded, or punished, at the trial.  The issue here is not fairness, it's ethical...

7538	(from whole phone call) I'd have to say 13% who are dishonest and 42% who are honest... 11% of the people on this phone call are lying. Because people say they're honest, it's possible to obtain information about them based on their confirming what they said first. 10% say they are honest, but lie to the truth. If you've never used respondent information before, then the answer is always printed in the table.
7539	 Seeing what other events have happened in their lives since the alleged wrongdoing, people probably just want to resolve things and apologize if they are held to account.  That is kind of understandable.  That said, if they did it BEFORE the trial, that probably shouldn't happen.

7545	weight is more a reflection of heredity then anything else . weight is more a reflection of heredity then anything else . p.s., nothing anybody can do could ever put someone down ! but losing weight for causes beyond their control is terribly harmful to health . plus they CAN lose their temper easily while doing weight loss . everyone can be under the gun and just say any excuse after being tired and moody . so only lose weight for the correct reasons to start with , my fatso !
7546	 You have to keep trying if you are considering your health is a problem. People look at weight, and don't care about how much of a burden you are really putting on your body! Either you're overweight, or you eat! Did you guys talk to a nutritionist or a doctor? I mean, how can that be a good plan? you need someone who knows about eating right and healthy. I have never talked to one so if you want to do that! I get paranoid thinking that if I don't lose weight it will get worse and worse, and worse.
7547	I don't work at a factory, so I can't understand how someone can be over 500 pounds. You are not very slim.... your father is the most overweight man I have ever seen.  And the bigger he is the less he works.  How much he eats he doesn't know.You are not very slim.... you might as well stay at the size you are because you are lazy as well. You eat way too much! I didn't even say you were too fat. I said you were the fatest person I have ever seen!

7555	What is more reasonable, is likely a subjective answer such as:" parental decision, varying situation". don't know maybe this could be a possible reference should have been "force to protect the younger child from injury." let 's say being late for dinner is no reason to use force to punish them
7556	 The child is at risk of seriously harming a younger child.  ### Answer:  yes, the use of force would be more reasonable in this situation. yes, the use of force would be more reasonable in this situation.
7557	 The parent is considered to have used reasonable force when he uses force only as someone who is held responsible for the actions of the minor in question would reasonably use force in the situation to prevent harming the other or, in some cases, actually cause harm.
7558	 An older child can administer punishments to their younger siblings. Note, however, that they can only do so if the children are under 18, or the child is a criminal. # this is an example. sibling can be punished, but for criminal, all are under 18 you can punish a sibling who has done something wrong

7562	Legalizing all drugs will allow criminals and criminals in power to make more money and they will just keep on making more money through the legalization of all drugs.  This is why legalizing all drugs is wrong.
7563	Legalizing marijuana is only going to ruin our society and bring more crime down.  You dont lock up the crinials that support terrorism and support the  9/11 attacks, do you?  No
7564	There's nothing nice about the drugs, by the way.. People say that our youth use them because the laws regarding them are so lax.  Sure, there are legal high schools and clude the kids the information.  THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is a natural substance in marijuana, but it does have side effects that can cause a dangerous condition called psychosis.  Be careful, still much evidence to see how it affects us humans. If everyone is allowed to freely have drugs why do most of them want to still be children and look at their well-being is

7568	    it doesn't have to be that way! basically, it's people who really doesn't want to know what is going on in the world who are stupid enough to just stop watching a TV set, or a newspaper(or they're just too lazy or they don't even want to do that) So it just has to do with who is stupid enough to not only stop watching what is going on but actually stop listening to what people are trying to tell you, and just plain ignorant but non-critical just because they have a big monitor in front of them so they can't see but hear or do anything but sit there and soak up the stupid-ness of people and not the stupidness of the people that actually have so much potential so much want to grow but can't because they don't have what someone else has!!! and most of the time that people are too stupid to listen to people who could possibly help them by just asking questions and maybe even offer an answer to what the stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid
7569	Whyle I may not like the things Bushy is doing,this doesn't mean I don't have a point.People these days do not realize the important things going on in the world.

7570	 Why No?  people can change and be better.  They may have some wish to change or a call to improve themselves in some way  execution is the natural, normal, logical consequence of so called 'normal' murders
7571	Yes, You have a valid argument. Both sides involved are impacted negatively by execution.   The victim has been left grieving and racked by questions, while the killer has been sentenced to death and cannot be erased from history.

7576	  Excuse me, but you're treating gun owners as second class citizens. All this makes me wonder why we're still fighting in all wars, when there are more guns in the world than people. Some of those guns have been used to kill and maim billions of people. Isn't it just a matter of right to defend yourself? Your argument is more endearing if you can focus on the true intent of constitutional rights... What are guns for?
7577	    You should be more selective about what you change to keep up the standard of your answer. To test this. choose one of the previous examples: Ps. Don, I hadn't seen that one up so recently, but I know that an increase in "people-to-person crimes" also makes murdering people more likely in some areas.
7578	The main reason is that people never have had the chance to practice! You can probably also say that their government won't allow them to purchase them or have them to shoot at a target (given that they're not in the military at that point).   What are your thoughts? why are crime rate?
7579	 Because I'm gun nuts => Because I'm military specialists => Because I'm airforce specialists => Because I'm military specialists Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves? =>

7582	The truth is that we don't know what "this" person looks like or thinks or feels or thinks he/she is gay or straight. When we claim that this person is gay, we are claiming some suppositions, and these suppositions may be very, very wrong! However, because you said that "no one is safe from the clutches of hate from angry people" - we can infer that this person is like this angry person.  Angry people are at least somewhat dangerous because they don't think things through.

7585	The decision to ban smoking in public places was a bad idea that makes more sense now. Yes, smoking is still very popular, especially when on planes and other public transportation. The problem is that people who want to smoke have to get the smoking permits to smoke in places that were free from smoking. No one really cares about the non smokers' rights now. But I think it would have been better if there were also a free smoking area. The danger in the first place was the damage to breathing and other physical issues caused by the smoke and the other smoke
7586	I like the arguments presented by the original writer. I support his position and would most likely support a smoking ban in public places if they go through with it. Not sure whether to support it myself
7587	We are all human beings. Even if I'm not a smoker, I would still agree to smoking being banned in public places if another person says that it is okay. I'll even defend that person if people don't like it. We all have rights and I would gladly defend those rights even if I don't agree with the policies or rules.

7591	 i agree wholeheartedly,but the world does not want war.we should change the world,and while fighting wars,we never realized what it really was.  We should never fight another war where lives are lost,but most countries fight wars just to make money & enhance their power. also,the belief that what we do will protect & to maintain peace,is just a myth. The US has a long history of leaving towns uninhabited or making a place habitable a living hell.
7592	 its so stupid to want us to throw a party....if i were world leader and ppl continued to hate me  would i spend money sending a party in my house and not let me?  at least he is pumped now that the troops are leaving....but how long do i think they will stay? wouldnt it be better just for them to give the world to the insurgents? And all you can learn in school is how to look at things from the US point of view.  how can one gain authority in the world when there is no understanding of  the local culture? Bush must learn how to deal with the local culture.

7635	Clarify the name of the feminist movement & the historical context in which that is happening. ‚ÄúMainstream activist feminism‚Äù exists within some feminist movements. The overwhelming majority of feminists are usually not talking about the slurs, harassment, and targeting of women at work. This alone is the culmination of a much more deeper set of problems. Don‚Äôt assume they‚Äôre middle class only feminists. It takes something like a recent and disastrous Supreme Court ruling involving a man being held responsible for disparaging comments related to a black woman's race in order to truly assess the position of feminism as a whole, and in particular concerning the implications of leaving slurs and harassment at work unaddressed. We live in a time where workers speak out. The most recent US election was tinged with anti-government, anti-establishment rhetoric. The world cannot hold a candle to what Justin Mateen did, but as a community, we must not ignore the problem.

7650	 1. You don't need a stick shift to change gears faster. Constantly Variable transmissions are the way of the future. 2. Stalls aren't really a problem unless you run out of gas. A highlander clutch should be able to take that large leap of faith, and it's considered a fair test of a car's horsepower and understeer potential. If it doesn't, it's time to swap out to something that can. The chances of a manual getting stuck are smaller on a wide road than on a narrow one. Even on city streets, you'd be surprised how quickly those short little slopes that are not too steep can erode your tires. You would be shocked at how quickly the drivers following you would be pulling out and heading down them, even quicker than you could change gears. Less attention would be paid to traffic safety. If the drivetrain is to be replaced, it is usually the clutch, and even that needs to be replaced as often as a normal automatic transmission, whereas the stater-closing, pelting, messy, noise-wreaking, confusing stick shifter has the added problem of stopping. That is not a bad solution, nor is it the biggest deal out there, but having multiple options is smart (Auto, Drivesport, Auto ECO, and Auto Power with heated seats, to name just a few). Stoned driving on steep slants makes no sense, it makes you faster, nothing more. We all want to know how easy it is to get those first few gears up, and you've kept that information

7652	  Argument 1 is true -- manual gearboxes are no longer a major option for vehicles with variable transmissions and shift systems. Similarly, shifts in city environments where vehicles travel long distances are no longer a significant issue. Finally, noise is no longer a significant issue. The odds of clutches failing to an extent are also negligible. While some people do not eat on the road, most of the drivers of vehicles today do. Most do not disregard their C.V. machines when traveling, however. Lastly, manual vehicles are the most silent vehicles available today.
7653	Due to the increased cost of maintaining a stalled clutch, I won't buy a manual car. Some people like them, but they are real losers for some major reasons. automatic transmission could be an acceptable alternative. add a manual gearbox to my car. keep manual gearboxes in the armies because they're good for starting on hills and start breaks. you might consider shifting well. offset the high failure rate of manual transmissions with continued engine damage. improve your driving. add some incentive for shifters. no longer consider stick shift cars as they can't last as long as cars with automatic gearboxes

7664	 Pepsi is the only one that seems to make sense. I think it has just enough caffeine. I drink it because it has the least sugar content. The amount of caramel color in Coke is not bad. It is right around the amount found in chocolate as you have probably found in other discussions. In the 400,000 other discussions I have read, Coke is by far the most used, used about three quarters of all time.  I will use Pepsi in the future.
7665	 I'm not sure that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. To make sure, I checked government statistics on Special Education from four years ago. A New York City government official told me that SdU has one of the following ratios: 67: 107, 76: 110, 68: 99 and 67: 99. The ratios are: 69: 104, 74: 117, 68: 107 and 67: 107. New York City uses a much more appropriate, progressive education model than which I've been thinking of.
7666	Special Education students need more teachers and equipment like individuals do. This solution would benefit the Special Education students as much as any of the solutions suggested earlier. : Australia offers one and a half times the cost for students in the classroom as well as six times the cost for Special Education. : Canada offers 4.7 times the cost for students in the classroom as well as five times the cost for Special Education. : Brazil offers three times the cost for students in the classroom as well as two times the cost for Special Education. : China offers one and a half times the cost for students in the classroom as well as once the cost for Special Education. : India offers no price at all for Special Education. (some countries refuse to set a price for their Special Education.)
7667	America spends 3 times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. Special Education students get one or two teachers that personally teach them and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart.
7668	America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms
7669	We can take either the Special Education education system or just about any other education system and rethink it all. Education reform is urgently needed today. I agree with the statement that Special Education students get one or two teachers that personally teach them and tons of new high-tech equipment in their classrooms, but Special Education students need software to help them practice math. Special Education students need students with disabilities in their classes. I love my kids and I won't be consistent if I only hire special education kids.
7670	 Scotland should be independent, but this should not be made permanent.  It should only be a temporary solution as the UK remains in many ways the greatest country in the world (a big mistake the political leaders made).  They should be expelled from NATO and cannot use the pound. But they should use the euro within 5-7 years. Scotland should stick to staying in the EU, with the rubbish in its banks and in the budget given to Scotland and other nations.  The EU should be removed from this.
7671	If they voted for independence then Scottish would become independent. Scottish should become independent right away as the UK is getting ready to break apart with other large nations doing so. The UK government has caused tremendous damage to the economy and democracy of the UK.   Scotland is already established as a nation with an army, police force, fireforce, military issues, and other issues. Scotland should retain the use of the pound and have it not been confiscated by the British government, has an army, police force, fireforce, military issues, and other issues. Scotland should also be removed from the UN/NATO and the other nations in the European Union.
7672	For Scottish independence we need a controlled exit from NATO, with full funding from the UK government. This is why you need to vote to remain in the UK. Ian Good‰∫∫, which is not a fan of the SNP. It doesn't actually exist. much can be done to reduce hostilities and then some ...See where's the money// Scottish people vote to stay in the UK. ### Comments: Scottish Independence gets a green thumb for Scotland but it being independent means no NATO membership and not the full UK government funding. This issue might be a hard one for the Scottish independence people to handle.
7673	Voting for independence would be a complete set back for Scotland and the UK, I would make the last part of my response into: in fact that would be a complete set back for the UK. I would think that any rational person would vote to remain in the UK, the United Nations and NATO. Would one man have the power to say for Scotland to not be able to use the pound? Be expelled from NATO? Unsafe from being given UN money? One man has no power to say this and no one should withhold funding or allow the UK to take powers over Scotland.

7675	It is actually a good thing that these spikes are not causing victims. Not everyone in London can afford a home, including owners of the apartment complex, whose families are forced out of their apartment. On the other hand, a recent survey showed that only 5% of households in London are made up of people from abroad.Many residents from abroad have to rent an apartment here. That is why these spikes are still really needed, it encourages people to enter the building and when they are within the building, they will not be likely to go to another store because they have already experienced everything here. Why were protesters violent? They want to prevent normal people from entering a store. They are simply injuring no one, but they are destroying property, they are a danger to the public and should be charged with property destruction. That is exactly what Tesco does with its anti-homeless spikes, helping to protect its customers from the undesirable situation that they would see if they entered the store with their heads down.
7676	  # This line makes no sense, and is probably not here. Rename this argument the first word is made uncapitalized: ignore_permission_label  ignore_permission_label = textwrap.dedent(     textwrap.fill(_('Ignore    [{}]\nYou    seem    to    have    a    very    different    point    of    view.').format(permission_label), 1280, '-'),     wrap=60, )
7677	Your clients have a right to privacy and to not be harassed by people passing by on the street. No one should enter their business uninvited. In this case, Tesco obviously doesn't seem to be being sensitive to the concerns of its customers. I believe that as long as the spikes are nice looking they should not be removed. Since Tesco is always too busy to add more staff and clean up after they pass through, the homeless people simply have to leave the property. I can see how Tesco could be accused of damaging and infringing the property rights of other businesses, but I disagree with the methods used to implement these tactics.
7678	In this case, this argument is completely off. The questions refer to Tesco and Tesco has no connection to the situation in London. It has to do with celebrities and how they affect the broader public's opinion. Tesco may still have something to learn about customer retention. Why should people be attracted to businesses where the homeless would be able to go to spend their hard-earned money without risk of damage to their vehicle?
7679	What is the business purpose of Tesco? to make money. They do not want to harm their customers. They might actually have a different intention for Tesco . Tesco is acting out of self-interest, because it needs to attract customers with its idea of having a store near any place, any where. Expanding is the key of a successful business, the more the better. They should not waste their money on providing grounds to homeless people.
7680	"I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral reasons for crimes against humanity, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape."  - Killing a person should be caused by the force of morality to make it desirable.
7681	In an example like that, I'd have to agree with you. Capital punishment is moral to use in an issue that goes against humanity. Maybe your opinion here is simply that having a skeletons in the closet kind of mentality that causes you to see capital punishment as an issue to use for most cases. I would disagree.
7682	 It's alright. Regardless of any other issue, capital punishment should not be used to protect the interests of society. Capital punishment is an issue that matters to the individual alone, and the death penalty should be used to protect them. It should only be used when that person is wrongfully accused and is therefore not innocent, as that scenario is the only situation that makes it worthwhile. It should never be used to protect societal/integrity or morals in the manner that the abolishers support.
7683	 I agree that the death penalty has many legitimate reasons to be used. There are those who feel it's unfair to kill people and therefore oppose its use. I personally don't think its fair to not to. I agree that these are indeed two different arguments. When we feel compelled to make choices like these, sometimes we feel like we're alone. Often times we can hear ideas from around us and gain insights into the choices we're making. After giving thought to the common humanity behind both sides of the issue, I have concluded that it doesn't make sense to side with the people who oppose it for purely moral reasons alone. I believe that its moral justifiability exists largely because of its potential to treat a victims' suffering to one extreme or the other (reducing it to zero when they die). The idea that it is unjust is... "one life", still exist, only that one life is not merely another human life, but an eternity, and is perhaps
7684	75% right  In a certain situation, capital punishment might be morally appropriate. In other cases it should not.   Argument:  Capital punishment, as well as some lesser levels of punishment, should be provided. However, we should not see this kind of death as justice. Capital punishment should, sometimes, be justified.

7691	I'm wholesale against pirating content online. Most people seem to feel it is harmless, since you're stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual company that created the content and deserves the money they worked their asses off to earn. The pirate bay doesn't even attempt to hide that it's soul purpose is to circulate torrented files of copy righted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is wholly justified.
7692	 I'm deeply against pirating online content. There's no way that the average PC or Xbox is able to keep up with buying every new release of the game they want, and it's very harmful for games to be available to people illegally. I've been playing and working on World of Warcraft for a few years now and that service enabled me to move ahead more quickly, but when I get online I use torrenting services to get my download, and it didn't hurt the progress of my characters much.  Every time I play an update it brings the price of new cards up, and the average computer can barely get through the first two levels of most classes. I would say that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his work and to protect his way of life instead of bringing down a place that has done so much good.   I hope the government has an efficient way to deal with pirate activity

7700	You might want to rephrase your introduction by saying something like this: Money is not the most important thing in life anymore but there are always reasons for you to leave your job. You need to know how much you make a month and how much you save a month to know what the future holds. The average salary of Americans is $41,202 a year which is significantly less than what a full-time student earns. While you should be aiming to earn significantly more than this, it can be hard for young people to do this and you can still do what you want to do despite your financial situation. This essay is about money but not the most important thing in life. When you reach the age of seventeen you're just beginning to think about becoming an adult. The issues of this essay are basically where you begin to have responsibility. This means you're starting to have to figure out what you want to do with your money and that you should decide as soon as possible. When you reach eighteen you'll start to get real jobs. As you get older and begin making money you should be able to spend time with people you love.
7701	 spend time on the movies, doing things you like, not hanging out the other guys to make your butts hurt with money. spend time with your friends, spending money on useless stuff, will make you bitter and pissed with them. live happily in your own persons, you'll be better off! . spend your money on your hobbies and your interest, you'll be happier with yourself.
7702	 Working 2 time jobs as well as being a student is a wise way to keep from bankrupting yourself. Even if you live with your parents it's impossible to maintain 2 jobs so the next best option is to be a part time student.

7703	 It's a tough world out there but being prepared to make the effort is worth it. We've always striven to let our kids do the same as we're doing with ourselves. We want them to make the best decisions for themselves, because they're smarter and wiser than we are. Why should they take our advice? At their age, they should know better. Be brave and follow your life instead of following our advice.
7704	 People will always exist and people may or may not be around to save you. You can create happiness and your own pleasures with your hobbies and interests because you have money enough. That does not mean that you should live without a partner for a while, it just means that you should find a partner for more than a few years if that's what you want. The idea of committing with someone you're just starting a relationship with is ridiculous, to begin with.   I like how you broke down the loneliness and your relationship with the person.

7711	...baseball this might be too simplistic, but one of the reasons why baseball would be America's favorite pastime would be the unity across America that it brings people together. Here you are taking into consideration the unity that baseball brings across America.
7712	 Baseball is the most popular hobby in America as it got very famous with Babe Ruth. That is because people here are interested in baseball and the other sport cannot compete. Try to find an argument that makes this answer convincing.

7720	Talking about hate campaigns is absolute rubbish and shows a naive view of what the reality of the world is about. The underlying issue is not Palestinian concern or anti-Semitism of the Middle Eastern muslims as the toppling of the Shah in Iran and al-Nasser in Egypt would clearly show. The underlying issue is the destruction of Islamic faith by other muslims.
7721	Unless you are a Muslim who really hates the US, you have a great reason to read this essay. Read the sentence to see if it makes sense or not: almost all the fundamentalists would be bombing, attacking US interests, bombing and attacking US interests, and so on, and so on.

7731	 Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil". Where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) If you are enjoying my work go to my blog on

7733	 Sadism is the most sickening act a person can commit for most of us, if not all of us. It is evil where we, the participants, are all unsusceptible to influence, of the bad-- "Well, that was obnoxious." yihcutoesu Responses should be at least 1 sentence long. Sadism and masochism are both a form of morbid recreation. Quite frankly, some adults are self-addicted to such activities, regardless of our spiritual beliefs.
7734	 The practice of sadism is evil because there is a power imbalance between the perpetrator and the victim. Sadism is evil because it gives the perpetrator power over the victim, or because the victim is subjugated to the perpetrator. Although sadists are familiar with the victim's strong will to survive, and accept the fact that sadism is rape as well as the belittlement of the victim. The thought of subjugating and weakening someone makes me sick.
7735	God created photosynthesis. He is the creator of all things and therefore the creator of photosynthesis. It is only logical that he designed this process. Note how he is also the designer of life itself. Once he designed it, it made sense that he would ensure that photosynthesis continues to be a part of human life.
7736	It is a miracle that photosynthesis evolved. photosynthesis is complex enough that it must have evolved naturally from one form to the next. It is amazing that a naturally occurring process evolved into something that could alter the physical conditions of the atmosphere so dramatically. photosynthesis is one of the greatest wonders of science. You are right that evolution is such a complicated process that nothing evolves by accident. That is a miracle in itself
7737	Since photosynthesis evolved and it is believed by some that evolution is a viable option, why not? what do you think is the probability that photosynthesis evolved? Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident? It is things like this that make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all at least in the beginning.
7738	Adam creates photosynthesis. Yes. God created everything and some people don't believe because they think God does things without having to think about it. Whether you believe in God, I don't care. I don't think it's something to get upset about. I know you have lots of opinions about what you think is right and wrong.
7739	We should all be thankful for photosynthesis and the help it has given to us in understanding the plants that are part of our diet. All of the food on the table we eat every day comes from photosynthesis. God created photosynthesis and we should all be thankful that it exists and is such a simple process.
7740	No the NFL is not as raunchy as boxing and wrestling. In fact, until they started the electronic reel, it wasn't a big boon to gambling. The NFL also made money hand over fist from gambling money. They have also been very supportive of professional athletes. Further, say yes only if you're a guy, be patriotic, play like a man, no dogs allowed in the stadium, etc
7741	Sports are a business, not an entire entertainment industry. Yes, all sports are a business first and entertainment second. Jerseys are being sponsored by corporations, they are already letting companies into college sports. The NBA fpsr and the Sister League are just experiments. NASCAR and the Olympics do allow the participants to wear sponsored jerseys, what separates them from the rest of sports is the fact that athlete get very little payment. I think I'll support the Billions of dollars in gambling money NBA.
7742	Yes, fix is in close to what happens in boxing and wrestling. Yes, all sports are a business first and most, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment. Yes, fix is in line with what happens in boxing and wrestling. Yes, NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponsors on jerseys. Yes, college sports is the biggest revenue for them too and unlike so-called pro sports, the athletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts, which is why they are jumping to the pros from the high school.
7743	My television program requires a sponsor. I'd like to see no pay raises, no increases, nothing for the players and such and the pay for top athletes might even decrease. The athletic program in college would be the one that the sponsor could cut as much as they wanted, becuase for the most part they all get huge raises. I think this is an action that would make for an exciting sports league
7744	Yes, all sports are a business first and foremost and entertainment second. They should also stick to legal limits and ask the fans to stick to legal limits too. I just don't like what Ringside Magazine are doing with the NFL tacking darts on to the jerseys. Whether the NFL wants to allow their fans or not, this is the correct argument. It is more suitable
7745	 bigger firms should not get into this business all the time. I want to be able to get the latest hardware. Maybe third party developers and microsoft should be aligned together. That way the microsoft gaming console could get the latest software and hardware and third party developers could use the PC or laptop to develop faster and cheaper and maybe they could charge a lot less for the games but I know it is probably unrealistic
7746	The Xbox only has three games at the moment but the same happens with the other consoles so they don't deserve their own box. Other games that they make should ship for the open platform. The open platform doesn't deserve to be the only game console because its games seem like crap. The open platform does not earn its competitors lots of money. The release of the Xbox 360's rival, the PlayStation 3, also happened to be the release of many third-party developers that made a lot of new games for that platform. the open platform doesn't deserve to be the only game console because its games seem like crap.
7747	It appears that you cannot play many different third-party games on a particular console. Of course, no amount of third-party competition could ever equal third-party gaming on those consoles but then why are the prices so high for them? You get what you pay for, right?  ### Suggestion: You might look into making the new platform open, that way a player would not only have the option of buying a large library of third-party games but will have them available any time they would like to play one.
7748	They will release a new console next year. PlayStation 4 consoles will be released next year. After that a new console will be released. Xbox will be released next year and a new console will be released. Nintendo won not make a new console until after those two are released. They have stated that they will wait and see what plays the best. They may also release it later.
7749	No, it would be more efficient to have a single card and share it between the main laptop and a desktop. So, why do I want to buy a desktop? That alone is ludicrous. So.... I've never even checked into the "Xbox" and "Nintendo" consoles. I only pay attention to whether there's a good deal for graphics cards and add them to my access list with great deals. so I don't bother.

7755	We can say that Elvis is a trend and he will always be associated with hip hop. and also something we will always play in a cd club. Elvis  is trend and forever. Elvis is trendy and as long as there is people out there to associate with him, that will always happen.
7756	Elvis will never die. People still like him even though he's dead. Does not make sense to reference that his clothes were different before. This may have been in the 1960s. Elvis's music may have been different in the 1960s but it isn't. Elvis has both black and white fans.
7757	Elvis' music is still popular in the world. We are going to look at some Elvis cd's. You can even order your own Elvis cd's to show you like his music. Show Elvis means you like Elvis. You may not know every single song on it or you may not like everything on it. But you are guaranteed to know at least one song.
7758	Sometimes when we see things popping up on the news it can be good. Make pop a lot more pop. He might die, but then again. Because of Elvis he was always Elvis. Something that always stood out. Elvis liked to put on his makeup in costumes. His you know thinner? No, he got fat Elvis. Elvis liked music and if he didn't he would have never became famous. Elvis was the king of rock 'n' roll. Elvis liked karaoke, Elvis danced, etc.

7765	Reactions to happen can only be positive. Instead of asking Why does something happen, ask What will happen when something happen? It would be better in that case because future is uncertain and riskier, so problems may happen.
7766	 More input: In my opinion the world is too open now and incidents like these do not need to be hidden. In fact, I think they are timely and necessary; it is essential to talk about these issues with other people to discuss solutions and explore new solutions. We should fight against human rights violations all over the world. Yes I think the world is too open now. Examples like this have been reported by the media all over the world. There is no reason why I could not live in a country that seems to punish me unfairly.
7767	Very cool topic. Yeah I think it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has. When Tianamen Square happened there were a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these. I can really see how it might happen.
7768	No need to be scared. It's more likely to happen again. Lots of pressure is put on governments these days. I can see why they struggle. No need to be scared. It's more likely to happen again. Lots of pressure is put on governments these days. I can see why they struggle.

7775	 My neighbors are worrrying about their land being flooded with salt water because the Marlins are building an airport. They say the government is to blame. To them this supports that the Marlins shouldn't be building an airport. So if a group of terrorists is building an airport, they aren't trying to get rid of Cubans, they are trying to get the government to make money from them.
7776	I disagree with the policy and i would like to see it closed. It is called Guantanomo Bay, it is in Cuba, and is run by the Cuban government. It is not owned by any one country or military. You might want to research this by your self and find out for yourself what you think of it. i do not agree with the policies regarding it.
7777	I'm just studying to understand what would happen during a conflict, especially about the military with this morning's democratic debate. I will approach the process with different perspectives to know what the people who do this see and feel. I do not intend to say, "This is what i think" without saying, "This is what I feel".

7781	Islam is responsible for killing 1 billion Christians, 250 million Jews, and hundreds of millions more in other non-Muslim religions.     Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Scientology are all religions. However, if you're believer in Islam, then you are against being killed for your religious beliefs. Christian, Jewish, or any other religion is a conviction only; an ideology is not a religion. The Koran is the official, absolute word of Allah. It carries no standards whatsoever and I do not believe that it can ever serve as either a role model or a guide to behavior. The Koran cannot be dissected to clarify its meaning. I do not believe that its religious scholars can exercise proper interpretation; its divinely inspired, written word is the only word of God, and faith in it cannot be broken or questioned. Now, just because Islam is so terrible doesn't mean that all Christians must become Muslims. That could bring down the world, and I'm more than happy for others to choose their own way, but there is no way to prove that Christianity is a better faith than Islam, because the Bible does not say or imply that.

7783	 'fight' is completely unnecessary to the argument, and would be redundant and inessential for it's construction as a thesis statement. However, my revised version is clear and reasonable enough. fear' is not an appropriate verb in your thesis statement, as an aphorism is used to make an important statement and is therefore generally separated from your argument by a comma. therefore I have dropped it. Here is the revised version: #1078 Requires Review Make the following minor corrections:  #1081 Requires Review
7784	Islam as stated in its texts can not be avoided, but neither can it be easily defended. Calvin says Islam does not reject doubt and indicates with regard to Christian doubts, and should remain in a passive state of being to be able to better witness about it. They should not always talk about religion, just being. Islam supports the opposing view and indeed supports the view that faith is possible. Islam is not simply a set of religious prescriptions. It is a particular form of human life. Islam cannot be avoided, but neither can it be easily defended

This guy was unpolite he was never by our table, he looked busy and must have had other guests that he was looking after and I almost ended up missing my flight because of him. Beware of poor service
7807	This could be a good story about a service team but it does n't really say much. I would need to see more detail so it would be more constructive to you:  # TODO: Maybe provide a bit more info into the rest of the story?   range(2,7)[4::2] # initialize the array  # decide what you want to do with the array... add stuff
7808	this guy mumbles those dish that are unfathomable, gave us a lukewarm coffee and after he served the food no follow up if we need anything, i have to ask a coffee refill from the guy clearing the other table. The food was good but the second waiter we had was a total let down .
7809	 A breakfast is very important to keep in body we always recommend staying on the best hotel stay and eat the best food one can Eat the food they serve at Paris hotel for first time and we were loving it, but when the second time we came the next morning we can feel the attention went . Avoid the second waiter they were just a total let down on the first one.  V

7820	 Restaurant we were dining at had a gift card promotion.  The promotion was $10 off and we used three gift cards to cover the 10, then tried to make another purchase. When we tried to add the gift cards, the manager accused us of stealing money by adding an extra $30 bill to each card.  We were not trying to steal money, we were trying to earn money from a gift card promotion.
7821	 The second company does not recognize the validity of a gift card, without the user knowing about it. This is unacceptable, and goes against customer service. By giving complete control to the customer, no one but the customer can regulate how the program handles the gift cards. The customer might feel empowered to use the card to their own advantage and then the gift card program would be a farce.
7822	The manager was obviously incompetent, and the restaurant is barely holding its own with so many competitors around. They took no accountability, and at some point I feel this company couldn't continue to take advantage of us customers when we are in desperate need. This company also stole our money. They do not have any integrity or values.

7824	Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. Management was very accommodating and comped our meals, only to turn around and say that the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, and they needed another 30.00, unknown to us was the fact that they had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. So they actually stole 30.00 from us.  No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!
7825	3 stars 3 stars  cognitive science work in order to understand it. In science, we hope to achieve knowledge through experimentation, therefore it is important to set up a scientific experiment before embarking on a research project. Compare and contrast Essay Lessons Learned from the Science Film Science film essay served as a clear lesson for me. This film taught us that knowledge, while knowledge needs effort to find and formulate, knowledge also comes out of taking steps to obtain. For example, one can explore new ways to decrease protein loss using gut microbials rather than injecting antibiotics into the body which may cause future diseases. In other words, some people gain from pursuing new knowledge and others need to be saved by old knowledge.

7834	I like food so wanted to give it a try. Does anyone like fried fish? This is an awful sandwich I am thinking about giving up eating for good as it is so terrible. I think this dish is extremely underwhelming. The fish wasn't much better than the water beside and the lettuce looked terrible, not fresh even for an extra $5. Do not pay too much for this sandwich and consider taking it back the first time you go to the drive-thru.   I suggest:  fried fish is not a meal.

7881	 The children I know have trouble seeing the positive side of their father. When they marry, or when they have their own children they are aware of their daddy's faults and can't bring themselves to love them. Because, for example, their kid never dances with them to their favorite tunes. Their kids are often quiet, introverted, and quiet. It's sad, but sadder still is that many parents make it the parent's job to bring out their kid's best side and if they don't, blame it on a good dad. Consider this task: My father didn't stay to finish his beer. Neither of us were any trouble. If you couldn't handle one mom, you should never ask to be a dad. Try to look at it from the perspective of your child or your child's child.

7885	I wouldn't even want my dad to be a good father. I wouldn't have anything against him if he's a bad father or a alcoholic father. The only way I would agree to him being my father is if he's a damn good father like me have a good one, of course not let him live there with me, and if he is a good father I wouldn't care about his family situation.
7886	 I rather be fatherless than having a pappy who drinks on the couch. and curses mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
7887	 MomMY, that's a stupid father I wish it wasn't. That would be better. Mother alone is fine with me even though she is a lousy mother. It's just how I am as a kid of 14. And I have a smart and wonderful father that I care for.
7888	If I would lose my father, I would most likely have to live in a town by myself without any people close to me. I wouldn't want to have to go away from my family. That's why I wouldn't want to have a lousy father at all. It's not that I dislike my father, but just that I wouldn't want to have to have him as a father.
7889	It is the father's fault that he's such a selfish, irresponsible, and drunk with hard liquor father. I am just a little too turned off to have a father with me. because I would only call him my father. This might be different if my father was a bit more supportive.
7890	 It is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
7891	 I am not a good father but I certainly am not a bad father.I spend most of my time trying to do the best for my family. I want my children to grow up safely, happy and healthy. Think about all the work I have gone through for them.
7892	 Even he is a father, he can't do much for you. Even he is a father, he can't do much for you.Even he is a father, he can't do much for you.Even he is a father, he can't do much for you.
7893	 You have a father.he may not be perfect but he is there for you. Each person wants to spend his life with a perfect partner. person doesn't need perfection but wants goodwill to succeed in his life.

7956	Yes, it's quite important and wouldn't it be nice if everyone made as good a decision as they could, no? How would you like to encourage pro-choice? If most women had the option to make the choice, no they wouldn't have a strong hand in their ability to have a baby? Since we know the government tries to force your religion on you, you would have a stronger hand if you were pro-choice.

7962	Longjump1, usz.jpg A, you wrote this: "No statements were made that we are not evolving, all the statements refered to evolution. You are claiming that the big bang is a red herring. But if you are now telling the big bang is not a red herring, then you have given credible evidence that we are evolving."
7963	sabrejimmy, Our agnostic evolutionary inclinations will not allow us to accept that the evolutionary framework has been demonstrated from any starting point in time until sufficient evidence can be provided to offset our conclusions. Your question was a blanket claim that the big bang must have happened at some point in the history of the universe to create the undisputed evidence on which the evolution framework exists.

There are still plenty of places where evolution hasn't occurred, even though there should have been better material to find signs of evolution. However, all the evidence points to evolution. evolution no evidence if it happened by accident then it must have happened because of natural selection and it must have happened twice..... evolution no evidence if it happened by accident then it must have happened because of natural selection and it must have happened twice....
7969	How can evolution be observed? A virus immune to an antibiotic? that's good evidence that evolution has occurred.

Just because you can learn specific information about radiometric dating doesn't mean there is a specific and set way to practice radiometric dating

It is the fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes it scientific rigor.

Today, society is very individualistic and the focus is on just materialism. This means that we are not improving the common good but rather hurt it.

7991	I think that's a good idea! us students are good at maths, we'll become more important. though, i think some students can't express themselves well, so i would like to keep uniform. also, although uniform can make us think about how to dress correctly, it also can make us think some dangerous things about how to dress.
7992	 I agree that it's a good idea. however, social awareness is important. I would like to see these people dress in a more decent manner. - Betty Smith (author) I think this is a really good idea. This is because people can dress like they want to and the teachers can concentrate on what they actually teach students so it can be more efficient and educational. And they can't waste time trying to figure out what they should wear and how many layers to wear. Because if it's unclear, why take their class or why stay in their class? They should all just dress the way they want, which may actually be easier for them to dress the way they want.
7993	i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.
7994	The student should wear the uniform so he or she could express freely, as well as avoid inauthenticity. other students can put their ideas into action. I think that it would be better for the student to be more selfconfident with less stress.

The amount actually comes from all of the other parts of the world.  ### Output:  Western Europe consumes only 50% of the world's bottled water. The amount actually comes from all of the other parts of the world.
8026	While most believe that European culture is to blame for 50 percent of water bottles, almost a third consume the tap water of Europe - with 65% of their tap water coming from Germany and France (possibly some other European nations), and a quarter come from Russia and Ukraine (possibly some other post-communist nations).

8046	 Governement must be involved in religious issues, or it will not be able to control them, so it does everything it can to make sure you stay focused on religion and not your true nature.
8047	 Fortunately, my religious beliefs aren‚Äôt coerced by the government. That solves the "problem". The comments on that blog are disturbing. Unfortunately, we are the government, not gods and we are in charge of many things we do not really understand well. If I do not defend my beliefs, I will be attacked for being an unkind person. Fortunately, my religion was not founded by the government, so it does not really matter what the government says about the definition of marriage.
8048	Really, government? Why are we talking about the government here? My business is my business, my beliefs my beliefs, and the government shouldn't mess with that. That solves the "problem".
8049	We therefore took a way to protect ourselves from third parties who want to exploit our personal, religious things. The personal, religious organisation was set up to protect religion from influences of the surrounding society.
8050	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, yes.
8051	Marriage is something good. People of all ages and all different cultures come together to build a new society. Only recently, people have started to think that all man and women are more than equal, but many of them still have misconceptions about different sexual
8052	Gay marriage is not good for society. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their opposite sex? Clearly, not.

8054	Will you support me, pro-lifers?  Without the homosexuals and pro-life supporters, we cannot exist.
8055	Maybe gays should just stop claiming to be gay and be an important force in society, rather than "staying that way". Since they claim to be gay, it makes them the diverse bunch and the victims.
8056	Changing parties, or at least changing there mind on what gay rights are like, is the issue, instead of fighting back by calling attention to yourself through your behaviour
8057	gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease).
8058	 gays are a bunch of cowards who need discipline and counseling. please take my advice and stop calling attention to yourself, it is distracting to me as a father trying to provide discipline.

8060	You should choose marriage that is best based on your beliefs  ### Note: Christian people think that marriage is one of the most important things in life to stick with your beliefs
8061	I'm an avid christian and i believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.

8087	Religion has no place in today's society. Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.
8088	But religion has also played a major role in society. It requires more responsibility from all of us. It creates unity. It encourages love and truth. religion is something that should be responsibly trown away.

Please remove the current punctuation.
8091	 I would say that I would start with the parents and then the teachers or a part time parent.   I don't know how to express it best but I think I would take things to the next level if the student committed a crime and also inform the other parents and inform the teacher if the student went out of line.
8092	Dont get any ideas or jealousy from your cousin. It would be really nice to punish the siblings with just your mom or dad having a 1 in the class.
8093	 I think it really should be illegal. Its bullying and not fair to other children. It makes me wonder how would the justice system behave if it happened to other children.
8094	 Idont. I dont think that was what the author was attempting to express. The author is now trying to say that he never submitted to the author of the earliest sister.
8095	I don't know so they don't get upset...
8096	No because of bad grammar
8097	yes so they can give them another excuse to do it again  Yes
8098	Could cause trouble if it was in school.
8099	Yes but only if the school trips are organised in a way they would be happy with it.  Yes
8100	Yes, because they shouldn't do it just because they fear some consequence. So they probably can be trusted to not do it again. Yes
8101	Because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line. Yes
8102	Yes, because of what the consequence is. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
8103	No, because then they won't learn what to do from the consequences. It shouldn't be so common, but unfortunately some parents are lazy and don't treat their kids with responsibility.
8104	Yes, as a parent would never abuse or punish his child without reason and at the same time he also knows what can and can't be done.
8105	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
8106	Yes, it's right to spank the child for contempt
8107	We knew the answer was going to be in the answer box so we weren't so far off.  ### No Output
8108	Yes they can spank the child only if they use a belt or something else that doesn't harm the child
8109	Welcome to the family! Look what I found in the restroom....
8110	 My religion has no proof, so that gives your religion proof that all religions are idiotic. Easier to read, even better. You can delete your 'Your religion' argument entirely and instead just say "Bible
8111	 Some Republicans believe in evolution so your religion is better because they have something to believe in while atheists have nothing to believe in at all. What do we agree? Christianity must have proof that atheists have no proof.
8112	 If your religion has no proof so that gives my religion proof. Makes no sense. If you have no proof, that makes me have proof in the Bible of my religion. When Christians do.
8113	Unfortunately the world is full of pundits who understand that evolutions theories are best supported by fact, and then give no backing to the theory when challenged. I'll give you a better example: the great skeptic Mark Johnston is making a fortune telling that humans were once monkeys - they're the ones who are selling out the evolutionary theory. They make millions of dollars but they do not have a product to sell, so they have little investment in their own view. They, along with their buddies, use their profits to help make disciples of their own so they can be in business with them
8114	 No more religion but its been soooooo long this came to an end fuck you christians :( semua agama f**k you f**king religious holy nuts, class labeling bullshit :) If you think there is proof so what are the atheists ? Thats a ridiculous question.
8115	 I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.

8117	I do not believe parents should spank their child to discipline them for improper behavior. Why did I say this?  I am of the opinion that parents should try their best to get along with their child and  if they are usually friendly parents, it may make things easier for the child to learn respect from them and agree to what their parents say.
8118	Find the factor groupings that are reasonably close to the items in the data. GCH algorithm would generate a few factor groups. ### Output: pcm now looks like this:      -ID  itemname  itemnum  # your code here...
8119	 Discipline the child by talking to them in a manner that makes them feel important and valued. Children, when well behaved, are very good and efficient workers and they help their parents with their work, apart from being very obedient and respectful.
8120	Okay, but who wants to be around someone who unfit to survive on the earth alone?
8121	Sorry to hear that. Everyone who spank their kid deserves an F.
8122	The problem is parents are so childish. Taking things away from kids is the only solution.. parents have to understand that while learning...
8123	The kids must learn from the example of others and still spank them ..
8124	The kids didn't want to learn..They didn't know. They didn't study.
8125	I said yes, i would still though i dont see why everybody would take it against me, unless you would of had a hidden agenda but as i said no.
8126	 No i would kill them (for kill) be okay without killing anyone. I mean let it be about killing and not killing someone (for no). Yes
8127	 I say yes i would because i would love to see you kill someone because a friend to a friend is a friend.
8128	No,i would because nothing would make you die,now you tell me i dont care if nobody say no matter what and i would think thats bad.
8129	Yes, I would attack because violence is always justified. No matter what I will attack people and think they were wrong. How are you going to Kill someone and do it for a mistake. That is not what I think. I dont Care what nobody says about it.
8130	I would turn him in if the police want me to. I am protected under the law and that I was not taking any chances. It is my duty to my son that I would turn him in to the authorities. It is time for everyone to come together to protect all the loved ones that died in the suicide bombing and take a strong stance against the perpetrators. If the authorities want to know who did it then why were you not telling them what you know?
8131	I wanted to help him. I wanted to find him and stop him. I wanted to help him fight the state with whatever means I had at my disposal and if needed most likely in a fight. When he needed help, did he not ask?
8132	Yes. I would turn him in. If the person turned himself in he would get to live and live in peace that his friend know what they did. It would make the person that killed know that his actions were taken to the fullest and can never come back.
8133	 I was wrong to do that. You have to do the right thing even if it is really difficult and the consequences are really big. Everyone would really be so proud of my strength if they could know about how brave I was.
8134	You should search for information on what happens to people if they get caught for trying to help someone rather than the least expected thing. You are a good person trying to do the right thing.
8135	YES I would definitely turn him in when he knows if a horrible person to turn the criminals. NO when he is a casual strangers. Yes I would definitely turn him in if he knew for sure. Yes I would turn him in if I knew him. Yes I would turn him in even if he was a casual stranger
8136	Yes, probably yes (Just because its possible, I would turn him in) No, probably no ("I would leave with a human being like that...") Yes, probably yes (Just because its possible, I would turn him in) Yes, probably yes
8137	No. I would kill him. No. I would kill him. Yes. I would turn him in No. I would kill him Yes. I would kill him No. I would kill him Yes. I would turn him in No. I would kill him Yes. I would turn him in No. I would kill him Yes.
8138	The argument does not seem to be to scale. The change the Victim know-how parameters suggests that you answer with "yes" if the victim is known and "no" if you don't know the victim. this should make yes if the victim is harmed NO if the victim is unknown (but you are 100% sure that the victim is known, despite this) and YES if you know the victim!
8139	the wife of the accused person suspect under arrest for murdering a lady in YYYYmonthmonthyear victim could be asked questions on if she knew the individual or if it was a stranger but would not be able to know if the victim also murdered other people because the police can only know how the convicted person acts
8140	My husband is good for the family, so I'd rather return the hubby. The reason why I'm saying that is he is good for the family.
8141	He is guilty but if he does the whole test and give you his best grade then he will get off. He doesn't really want to get in trouble but he just can't leave the whole test because he wants to get A. Yes, my husband will. I am really sad that his life will go by just because he can not leave the test.  Grade = float(input()) score = Grade // 10
8142	I would be furious, angry, sad and care less. Friendly, slightly bemused and care more. Friendly, slightly bemused and care less.
8143	He'd probably never see his wife or his daughter again. People do wrong deeds and aren't always smart enough to realize they made the wrong choice.
8144	 not bad answer. I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.
8145	 Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law

8148	 I would be ashamed to turn in my wife to police if i caught her having sex with the underage gamer you would turn in her if you caught her having sex with the underage gamer
8149	 We should really care about human rights, and hate crime but we should also realize, that crime does occur, and all of the victims of crime deserve the same recognition as the criminal involved. Thats all that needs to be said about it.  /ÂÆùË¥µËõûËùìÔºàÂ•ΩË©ïÔºâ/ https://lesson.taobao.com/study/vip/lesson Detail
8150	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to chose and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
8151	if abortion is unsafe, people will have less sex. ### Note: B. Be careful not to make a bad point.  No mention of food. All this talk about abortion is way too emotional.

Be abled to support yourself with your own earnings. Don't choose irresponsibility. If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not.
8154	 If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions.
8155	 If you want a baby but aren‚Äôt able to have one, consider adoption. It is better than abortion. Adoptions are nowadays increasingly
8156	Adoption is the best choice for a baby after termination is performed. You can continue to birth the baby and then apply to the adoption agency.
8157	 Treatment:  One word: Adoptions might be given to someone with any number of issues (re: growth up issues) or if the baby is born with any number of issues.  This can be avoided if you carry on to birth and then put the child up for adoption.  This is an area I struggle to come up with arguments in, my normal opinion would suggest that abortion is

8159	SmallVersion:  One word: Survival  Yes, if you already think you have a viable option for the survival of the child, it makes perfect sense to consider the adoption route.
8160	The argument has been modified to comply with the input of Medical professionals and opinions of people who are near to the topic. Most women do not abort as result of rape. This is a fact from statistics. It is an irresponsible action to abort an unborn child, unless the baby would cause permanent physical damage to the mother.

8162	We shouldn't allow the woman to kill the child to avoid taking the baby's life. Because the woman is still the child's biological mother, she should still raise it as her own. Let's not allow someone to say otherwise because they obviously haven't been in either the situation of adoption or abortion.
8163	 Just because a woman gets pregnant during rape does not mean that she will want to raise the baby to bring to her family. She may be relieved to have a baby she wants and consider adopting the child or raising the baby as her own. So don't just because a woman gets pregnant and brings a baby into the world you have any other right to take the baby's life.
8164	The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.

8170	The parents are responsible to make sure that kids are well-trained to focus on their studies and learning.
8171	Kids shouldn't be focusing on playing computer games, making sure that children can learn as much as possible.
8172	Policies should be more focused on children being safe. To prevent bullying, they need to be taken away from competitive games.  ### Updates:
8173	We can find the answers by asking questions. Which is more important: learning or competitiveness? We can learn if we ask questions.
8174	Core classes are more important. Students should be more focused on studies, and the competitiveness should encourage students to become more focused on studies.

8197	 Between marriage and friendship relationship of people, if its been banned it means only friendship relationship should be banned to satisfy all the time they have stayed on desparate hate, dislike and sadness. A gay relationship has no offspring but have also helped many people within the community without harming others, and thus need to change their minds and accept it even though most
8198	It seems acceptable now. You would know, my dear....... lot's of people have and won't change even though we live in the 21st century......
8199	It may not be exactly what you think. But for that matter, how could you possibly know what's in a person's heart???
8200	 I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.
8201	 Personal pursuit is better becuase it gives you the freedom to decide what you want to do with your life. Its also a good thing to help others reach their goals.
8202	 With reference to your comment. There is a difference between having your own goal in life and going after someone else's goals. Yes, its good to have goals and interests other than just your own, but its still your goals. Good Luck,
8203	 Person can always decide what is good for them. We can help others if they need help in achieving their goals. It is very important to have a boss or mentor to motivate us.

8205	 This should help others: ...   B = 'bob' print('I feel like it is better to help both, ',str(B)) print('but in order to help others you need to help yourself')
8206	 Person's goals should be taken into account before helping. Otherwise, there will not be any betterment.
8207	 Do not make excuses for yourself when you do have plans to do both.
8208	Thank you for helping me with this. It has been of great help to me.
8209	I feel like it is better to do one, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.
8210	 Although we have free speech in America if our speech incites a riot or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law then there can be legal repercussions.  The reason this so seldom happens though is because it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another and this can be hard to do.
8211	 We make every effort possible to ensure that our speech is always balanced and is not subject to abuse. America is often the subject of terror and assassination plots by people that clearly have no reason to be here.    ### Discussion:  The author most probably talks about government outspokenness

Yes, and far too often, we're still waiting for the police to come and take away people's precious nuggets of information.
8214	Unfortunately, people often end up being arrested for speaking or posting their opinion about things they agree with because they have more rights. Nothing has happened in these two years because I have not really said anything online that may have incited or harmed anyone.
8215	Unfortunately, it's more difficult to argue that your decision was your right.  Even more than that, it's probably impossible to argue that the decided approach was "better than the other" approaches you considered, and certainly makes a weak case as a justification for your action.  You've been on your bike, along with two friends, five minutes before this point.  As you near the weather station at this weather phenomenon, you hear "Whoa!" and the bike is caught in the nearby chunky mud.  At that point, you realize you were going too fast to maintain good control of your bike,
8216	I do not agree with the person - the look will be ignored. The look will be ignored. The look will be ignored. It is a mutual misunderstanding. That's why  I'd suggest there's probably a much better explanation that you have. I beg to differ
8217	Respond appropriately. If you needed to hit people, I'd recommend you figure out how to learn the Art of Defense, since assault is the only action you can take against yourself. If you think you're fine, but find that your parents, too, are reluctant to accept this person as a roommate, the wise thing to do would be to talk to them, but that is not necessarily a sign that you're poor at communication.
8218	Only say what you think is true.  Again - if you're right and there's no way you can prove otherwise, so be it.  Therefore, saying you are 'not guilty' based on not knowing the true answer would be inappropriate.

8225	New Zealand's Crown shouldn't pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. The case is law that such actions are against treaty and international law and that the crown should not make effect of such orders. So it's only fair that the crown should not pay, no matter the rate. American owes Vietnam because of state sovereignty, Greece owes Iran because of state sovereignty, and Greece has been to far and beyond its sovereignty to take such an action.
8226	If Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty. Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today and would contravene many treaties and treaties should have greater force in international law
8227	This argument is more scienfical than policy and does not address the issues in the arguement. Canada has agreed to pay compensation for breach of a signed treaty between Canada and the aboriginal peoples of Fort Simpson, which provided compensation for Crown territorial rights over certain indigenous territory in Treaty 6.4. of that agreement. It is essential to remember that Canada did not suffer economically as much as New Zealand during the colonization. Canada took a portion of the territory and settled it in British Columbia and Alberta.
8228	   # Arguments placeimpotence ( Great Britain , second culture ): "a real example was given during the short England v Italy series here in New Zealand when England was defeated in the second test, the local rugby clubs including all the overseas English players continued to do community service for England and the captain, the rugby chief, submitted an exemption form."  placeimpotence ( Great Britain , colonising ): "a real example was given during the first England v Italy series in England where the respective teams served as the English and Italian colonies until England was forced to acknowledge they were occupied colonies."
8229	compensation for war losses. Britain was to pay compensation to America for war losses, Germany for war losses, and Greece would be clearly owed for war losses. Texas would definitely be compensated for war losses but perhaps nothing in terms of international law. Caveat: All treaties are under new terms and require ongoing agreement and conduct in international relations to be effective as close to zero dollars. All international agreements are agreed upon by the parties to provide an equal right to all states to enter into an international agreement in the same manner as the Treaty of Paris, 1788

8245	I get it, it is the American way, wants to win USA Patriot football star and video game player and now wants to entertain illegal immigrants who are not equipped to get a job so that he can become a USA Patriot football star and video game player. America is not open to new people so is an awful idea and not what the Americans is all about. They are giving up on their ancestors and trying to emulate the western way.
8246	What cannot be argued is that immigration contributes to the prosperity of the United States. Countries only prosper when people work and pay taxes. The numbers say that immigrant to America is generating billions of dollars in taxes. Immigration also contributes to American living standards. Immigration also produces thousands of jobs, thus feeding the system. Immigration is one of the major development tools and drivers in this country. No doubt! Immigration is one of the major development tools and drivers in this country.
8247	The question isn't about Immigrants being a thorn in the side of American instead it is about immigrants being a threat to its Border, the laws for immigration controls are very strict in that all immigration must be proof a job has been available for U.S. Residents. Why, someone who can find a job of their own choice in their country is likely to be leaving that country and laying off their family members, yet they chose to ignore the possibility of paying taxes and working, not being a threat to our way of life and receiving from us what they have not only taken, but also denied to their homelands as they did not want to believe they had a right to even try to make their as a legal citizen, so that is a huge threat to the United States, they are the ones that need our laws rather than foreigners.

8249	The law is not prohibiting migration to America, but those who want to come in illegally. If you want to come to America, do the right thing, ask for permission from the US consular and get here legally. The argument of, immigrant doing the job nobody want to do is not correct and should not be entertain. If they want to survive they focus their energies in developing their countries and enjoy the fruit of their labor for their mother land.
8250	In a civil law system, courts are bound to rule such that they are harmless to the parties involved in the case. So, in a civil law system, it is illegal for courts to give a ruling that is not harmless to the parties involved.
8251	  No it can't.   Pure common law country is United Kingdom. so no this can't happen in the united kingdom. Because the court can apply all the times to provide solution for this problem. so no this can't happen in the united kingdom.

8255	 1. try to claim to have lost it or destroyed it - This will almost certainly not be effective, as you have several more bad checks on file for the company.    2. try to "temporarily lose it or destroy it" - This might be a realistic option, but you will have a hard time doing so. The checks are frequently deposited into your account to start a new payment cycle. The bank has to make sure that if they are a questionable item, it is flushed out of the system.  It will be difficult for a man to walk into your home and show a warrant to declare "temporarily losing checks".  The search warrants are not necessarily limited to the premises of the company, as the data may be stored on a remote computer or in the company's records.      3. try to "freeze or store it" - This might be a realistic option, but that too could be a problem.

8260	 Unfortunately the answer provided above does not appear to be correct. However, as salaried employees are covered by the minimum wage, the law of minimum wage will still apply. The answer is 8 hours per week, considering the time they work there must be 8 hours per week.

8270	 Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that, they do not give proper screening of individules before they give them a badge and gun. They give these gung-ho I-can-do-whatever guys who think they can get away with it cause Im a cop people a job.  Also, factor in the race card, because most of the cases are white on Black crimes.  they fear the black man so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue.  It sickens me that they allow them to get away with it.  This country prides itself on freedom, what about the freedom to walk or drive and not have to worry about the people who are supposed to be protecting you.  Stop Racism, stop police brutallity.
8271	 If Police want a job they need to have correct screening. Making sure they have experience, professionalism and be they have a track record of not coming in with a criminal record. They need to interview they candidates more closely for these reasons. They cant keep giving jobs to any one who just happens to be a police officer. Please be more objective and factual about the question. stop racism ,racism etc. etc. the u.s is mainly a black nation mostly ,enough ya shit no commisions
8272	 Those of us who are not accepted by your superior race will not be given jobs by you because we are not wanted. Cops are bad people. Every job. Stop being a bad people. I mean police brutality is pretty nasty. it should be stopped. they are doing you wrong to be a black man. . I am happy you have fed me. :D Thats pretty good. What a joke. Fuck.. Who says cops can't make friends? ALL cops are dumb, bad, blood thirsty, racist, bigoted, property thieves, SACRED assholes.
8273	 Police brutality exists because of the U.S.'s racial bias. Blacks don't want to be policed because they fear it being over-reached and they want police to act like humans rather than as instruments of government. Black fear their lives and those of their families are threatened. The U.S. should not have a law which diminishes the value of the poor by requiring people to show proof of wealth to receive assistance. Police brutality exists because Blacks don't have complete control of their lives.
8274	 Police brutality exists because white men do n't know how to appropriately view people who aren't white or white men, give them a job with the same skill set and training and any security has been removed from them, then expect them to pull the trigger, use a gun to protect you and their communities, instead of letting you freely walk around and drive safely. Stupid shit. Unacceptable. Dont support police brutality!

DUI does not stop them from being bad people...
8282	yes, and most of them are hypocrites. our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. the whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. we watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed), but how can you  fight it?

8286	 The goal of the teacher should not be to put a person to death for the sake of revenge on his family or others.  The teacher should actually try to bring closure for the family by educating them on what happens in court to get convicted of a crime that would qualify them for the death penalty. The state justice system strives to prevent revenge- but cannot always control one's behavior.
8287	 death penalty is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers ### Refined translation: death penalty is the punishment given to an offense committed after being convicted by a jury of your peers. and most prisoners only get life imprisonment without any opportunity for parole
8288	 Punishment such as death, as a result of an individual's crime, would be justified in the following circumstances:  - not only by the convicted individual but by the victim's family as well as the communities  As a result, where there has been a previous convictured death and there is reasonable doubt or further evidence of the possibility of a similar crime, the death penalty is a proper and just means of closing the issue of compensation and also ensures that potential criminals are not able to say that they have been let off lightly for less wrongs.

8292	No, to seek a Commission, unless you are a registered Real Estate broker and have a written pre-existing agreement from each estate beneficiary that you will seek to receive their commission or a court allows you to seek it after notice to the beneficiaries. For the above to hold true, any extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate must either be consented to by the estate beneficiaries or be allowed by a court after notice to them.
8293	No.The assumption that you become a P.R. for some reason other than your obvious reason for it (selling their real estate) is an obvious red flag and is clearly unethical. There may be special circumstances, such as tax-exemptions, that are sometimes possible in certain types of deals. But not becoming a P.R. for the sole purpose of selling their own real estate is the exception, not the rule.    Conclusion: No
8294	No, only individuals with broker licenses can charge broker commissions. Indeed, doing so is strictly prohibited unless the soliciting party has entered into a written agreement prior to the transaction itself to pay the broker a fee based on a percentage of the sale price or an accrued payment against profits, and to return any proceeds to the estate after paying the broker or the investment group for their services.

8327	Liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Regularly disagreeing with extreme liberals on society issues, they support traditional liberalism, the role of the government and even full-blown liberalism. Conservatives are not for the protection of a traditional way of life. Conservatives are against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

8329	Libertarians: Libertarians are a loose form of extreme liberalism that agree with several of the founding fathers principles. Libertarians are against the values of conservatism and their policy is to proclaim a free society in which there are no limits on human liberties and consequently, on actual freedoms. Libertarians favor social equality and want the social classes abolished and capitalism advocated. Libertarians believe that many social problems like poverty and inequality can be easily solved by the establishment of a society that is free to follow its own rules, to make and implement policies. Libertarians believe that the government can and should be a defender of freedom. Libertarians believe that human beings are born free. So, as libertarians believe, no one has the right to exact from another person the obligations of property. Libertarians believe in peace, isolation, and low taxes.

Plus, this woman wouldn't last long if that was the case!
8336	 Its irresponsible to wear a veil to work in a company . Regards , Gail ( 1 star ) Gail , you raise a valid point and I appreciate your comment. For the record , that's my overall impression of those wearing their faces covered. If it makes them feel safer then that's fine but I feel like these women are distorting themselves and their beliefs.
8337	 My mom never went to the barristers in court and the judge never considered asking for her to remove her veil, she could barely hear.  I know my mom, she came to court instead but her veil came in the way and really she couldn't hear the judge.   Let's do the same for the woman in question - she came to court with her veil but it was in the way, she couldn't hear the judge, so she should really consider removing her veil.     Made some minor changes.
8338	 The judge does not need to repeat his question because the woman should have been able to come to court with her veil on. On the contrary the judge should have made no condition for her to wear the veil and have allowed the situation to unfold for a quarter of an hour to see whether she could carry out her duty, not to say to bring her husband or somebody else along. It's good that the judge had said quite clearly that he wanted to hear his question.

Check the site at the link below to see them. TWO - nobody has ever passed their flag on from one side of a fence to the other. There are videos online that show this. It is against the law. VERY CRUCIAL - whether there are death threats - I don't know. There are people who protest. The proof is posted below if anybody cares to look. What should happen to that flag is what should happen to the flag.
8362	Yes, it is more appropriate to address this issue in the military setting as a result of deployment to some war zone. Given the following facts: soldiers are trained to deal with and respond to threats, so where could this behavior fall into place? the local military unit/block where this person is deployed to to do "defense from the attack of other attackers"

FYI - Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan" (I call fans of Bush "traitors"). He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn't vote for him? say no but respectfully disagree

Be careful not to confuse other feelings for love. Did you know he was your uncle before you got involved? I know you fall in love with who you fall in love with but there is a brief window in which you can apply the breaks. What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet? If I were you, I would try to steer clear and if he manages to end the relationship with the other lady and keep his relationship with the kids maybe you could think about him again.

What do you mean that? Don't you think we are friends with him? Mom: And so what if you don't like him anymore? Why are you just obsessed with him? Mom: You won't change, will you? You are just jealous because you don't have a dad! The Kids: Not so fast Mom, I'm not going to date him and I'm definitely not dating his other half. Mom: Just because? Mom: You should know better than that, there are plenty of other guys!

8368	He is my uncle. but I was really in love with him. I fell in love with him while we were already together. The moment the love child opened his eyes and told me I was pregnant, I just got really confused. Because I thought he loved me more than the other woman. I think I made a terrible mistake. This experience has really made me realize that I am worthy of love and that he is the perfect man for me. do not let this happen to you

8372	$$\begin{arara} well you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are talking. marijuana seeds dont fly out of birds. any dumbass knows what mj looks like just from the leaf, yeah you can get in trouble for cultivation, not that much if you only have one plant and claim you dont know what it is. they wont believe you anyway. you wont get caught, if the cops find out then your friends really arent your friends.
8373	 What do you want to grow? Bamboo seeds might fly out of birds, btw. Bamboo has very often been grown as a form of illegal drug. The experience leads to great bamboo morphophysiology. Bamboo grows at a tremendous rate. If you can grow bamboo over the course of years without any adequate nutrients in the soil, it can easily grow twice the height of a man with very little effort.
8374	If you get caught you will be found not only in possession of a plant but also violating federal law. You will be taken into custody and charged with possession. You might then be deported. If you are caught growing a small amount of marijuana you may get a lighter sentence. You may be fined or not. Also you will have your plants destroyed if they are found. You should know that growing will not make you wealthy and will lead to serious consequences from growing!
8375	woman should be detained not institutionalized. how long will be determined by court. if she is still pregnant, she will spend a short time in jail. who should pay for the prison is andy of course.. take responsibility!!!! or put her in clinic instead it it is quite expensive so it not worth. who makes the choice the criminal and her mother we if you would take responsibility to do a better job then you should stay out of drugs.
8376	  mothers should get access to free substance abuse treatment programs. copd should be addressed like alcoholism. the tax payer should pay for those addictions. that includes the children of these mothers. irresponsible people have the right to assume you want to buy your baby because you want sex, if that is the case then they can make babies with you, so once babies are not only a liability to their mothers, they are a liability to society. as a society our big brother is easy enough to find even with money, we can eradicate stupidity and irresponsibility or at least at its reduced scale.

That's the way I would phrase it... That's because people don't think about it. You make stupid choices. Be responsible.
8379	the mother should go to prison and pay for the treatments. the mother should go to jail until after the birth of the baby. unfortunately these laws don't work for the mother. instead, we should force these be punished with taxes. Congresswoman, the penalty is too lenient when a woman uses substances as a means to hurt her baby when the child is vulnerable.  when someone is facing drug or alcohol addiction problems, they need to be incarcerated immediately. go back to the start until they choose to add something with love.
8380	Yes, the court will see fit to make sure such things as bans on late-term, will require parental notification for teenagers, and will require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.
8381	As a dentist, I'm looking forward to clamping down on braces to make sure they are secured with proper hardware and properly maintained (or they'll be removed) and then I'll be able to build a big dentistry practice and make a lot of money... whoopee!
8382	Stats issued by the Human Rights court may show that the charges are invalid. With that, here are my suggestions to the court: Remove any interpretation on an "epidemic" and possibly suppress the diagnosis for the sake of medical parity laws. For consistency, I would suggest suppressing the diagnosis, as it is confusing to have a "minor problem" as diagnosis and instead doing at best a "symptoms" per remotely darned reason. I would also suggest suppressing the diagnosis as my doctor father was sick for six months before we got a proper diagnosis.
8383	Well, having a Prince of Peace himself, we can expect to see (at least) something tempered by his experience as Lord Chief Justice. It will, no doubt, be a speedy process once the new Court gets going to allow for some new, more liberal tunes.  It may just take longer for the Court to fully agree that telephones should actually be outlawed for children (one of the penalties for a new D&R) and consistent, uniform (not gender-specific) waiting times in emergency rooms for medical matters be required.

8385	the proper reason to do this is to provide a religious context to all those people who dont feel comfortable having gay marriage. all those people who support gay marriage need a religious background of sorts to explain why they do. not so other unwarranted opinions of what constitutes morality or good  or morality are fundamental to nearly every culture and come in stark contrast to the "punishment" system that utilizes misguided religious views to punish the errants or the undeserving.
8386	God and love It is my view that God and love is n't a sin.  I think most people who reject this sinful and oppressive concept of love are letting cultural roles separate them from God.  Christianity is a religion which is first founded on love; its at its core.  I personally do not believe Christians and atheists should be within the same boardroom yet I do believe that there is no room for belief systems to force their followers to put up with laws  that take precedence over their faiths.
8387	Because heresay is based on nothing but opinion. Two men who are in love because they have a good time together and enjoy each other's company at marriage deserve each other's support. Appearing on mtv with a thug shows that she is embarrassed of who she is. CL listens to the same talk shows everyday. Carpe diem, enjoy life

8412	 Stop only when a train crosses the tracks, but again. I feel that if a train is about to cross the tracks, they should clearly signal it to drivers, and shouldn't be surprised if a driver stops to check if the train is about to cross the tracks. If a truck with special rules stops at railway crossings, then it's fine if it is not letting people get in who aren't allowed to. But generally: the better choice is to be very careful when stopping at railroad crossings.
8413	Yes, I think the best option is to stop and listen for trains. I choose to stop because I feel that this is safer than not stopping. Simply listen for trains when on the road. You will be able to determine if they are coming. If you need to cross, remember to read the signs and stop prior to making the crossing. If you really need to cross, you have many methods of doing so without jeopardizing your safety.

8426	The events of the movie happened fast and it was not very entertaining to watch, however, as an avid Disney fan myself, this was one of the first movies that I really, really loved as a kid so I couldn't really judge, so I say one of the best movies. Y'know? In my opinion, however, it was too dark and had a bad ending.
8427	The Lion King movie is just another predictable cliche like so many others. This is what watching it as a child might have influenced you to believe, but have kids in the audience? What's the point of them? Just remember that the Lion King isn't someone talking, it's a story. Because it's a story there's value in hearing the story from the perspective of someone whose experience came later. There was no grand anything with this movie other than everything being well done but for some strange reason they criticized it for this reason
8428	"Predictable" and "cliche". Readers can find Kimba the White Lion a predictable and clich√© movie even without talking to any of them. "This movie is so predictable that it's cliche."   #Other responses may be "Nothing special" "The characters were nothing special" "No one knew where to turn" "This movie was awful" "This movie had nothing to it" "No one could stand the movies that came before it" "This movie was so bad" "This movie is awful" "This movie was nothing special" "This movie is boring I watched it"
8429	  When the Lion King was in its heyday, the Disney movies were just as predictable and shallow, if not outright pathetic.   Kimba the White Lion would have been better off if it were written for one of their other characters. For instance, you could have made a villainous prince look really good. Just see what you can make of a simpler concept.
8430	 Yes, the news often reports stories of lottery winners who were traumatic experiences. However, you should not let that discourage you from trying to win the lottery. Just keep in mind that the experience of winning can be anything from calm excitement to total fear and panic. We all make these kinds of choices everyday, and the feelings and mental state that you feel are very subject to your emotional state and your chemistry as well.

8433	 Which of the following statements is TRUE: People who win the lottery do NOT want the public to know about their winnings. This is the main dissenting opinion. Thankfully, there are many cases of legitimate winners. There are lots of stories involving exploitation and even murder related to the lottery. It would be very inappropriate to let the public know that a specific person has won. This is true. Thankfully, there are many cases of legitimate winners.

8435	 I decided to donate to the homeless instead of stealing, but not all the homeless are fools. Some of them are terrific singers. Some of them have no cause to be homeless. I asked them a few questions and I want to share it. Have you ever thought about giving homeless a helping hand? Even if you're not homeless yourself, you can still give help to others by donating to homeless people instead of stealing from them. I've also asked a few questions about their situation. What's your opinion on the homeless problem and how can you help?
8436	  I am an LA urban planning major student who just moved here. In downtown, I have found that homeless problems are really bad. They knock over my handbags and tread into my offices when I'm working. So, I would like to help the homeless by taking steps to improve sanitation. To maintain the economic balance of urban areas, what I would like to do is to first get rid of homeless problems and then adapt new facilities to the situation.   In my opinion, homeless problems need to be addressed and improved by educational and medical facilities because they need help and expertise.
8437	 " There have been changes in the LA area and city government is improving. Before now, homeless used to attack people while begging and some of them use drugs to survive. Now there are move restrictions that prevent homeless from living in some areas in and LA. The LA has many camps for them now and have easy access to medical treatment. "  " The LA area also has improve response to homeless in the downtown area. " The homeless are not unclean, but they probably aren't clean either. Improve overall homeless support, though - they are a rather big problem in some cities.

"I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system." "I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy."
8440	 ¬£30 meals/day Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure.
8441	 Yes, there's someone out there somewhere, with enough power to stop these tragedies from happening. Nickie Yes, there's someone out there somewhere, with enough power to stop these tragedies from happening. Nickie Answer: No, I'm not the one who booked the flight - but I am someone who worked at a marketing firm and have contacted Malaysia Airlines' customer service about the issue. Good work, Nickie

8443	 Introduction to Devise your own response. I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.  I'm currently researching all manner of alternate airlines. The cheapest airline I've found is Air Asia, which is currently offering round trip tickets from Dublin to Hong Kong for $ Dois thousand, $22. And can be booked through a leading travel agent. However, I suspect that the airline now operates as part of the Star Alliance, so the bargain fare may be 'offshore'. And there is no guarantee that the airline is safe, so I'd be wary of giving money for flight tickets with the airline at present.

8445	Discouraged by it. Reminds me of Borderlands, but without the space battles. If it is cheap, I think I'd just pick up Grand Theft Auto IV instead. I've played neither of those and I really wouldn't like to have two games featuring flying ships. If the game is $60, I'd buy it. I'm not sure how cool I find the graphics. I'm not a PC gamer and the PC version doesn't look as good as the XBox 360, so I don't know the performance aspects of this game. Maybe I just really do not like flying ships

8449	You should have more faith in the developers of a new game than you have in reviews. It's entirely possible that a game you love will actually suck once it's released. Hope you enjoy it.

It may also be a good review

8451	I am American. Point out that Canada and America share many similarities. Canada isn‚Äôt getting better, and our country is riddled with racism, institutional, and public, regarding Black, Asian and Indigenous people, while unfortunately, America is even worse. Since I don‚Äôt personally want to be dragged into the same turmoil as the majority of Americans, I too left. For one, your brilliant idea of defying your parent‚Äôs roots makes you selfish and ungrateful. They literally helped bring you into the world. We can never be as specific as you and your mother are. This is okay, but it is also over-generalizing to put people into ‚Äúequity category‚Äù. Therefore, Canada isn‚Äôt safe. Start to see people in terms of colour, height, accent, ability, job title and so on. If you were born abroad, Canada will have a chance. Making the majority of Americans ascribe to your definition will further destabilize your already splintered culture.

8454	 We are not keeping up with the culture in our neighborhood. We are trying to move forward with our own. Many of our differences can be seen in many places and that is a great starting point for mutual understanding. What we should be looking to unify is our thoughts and views, and that will happen naturally if we all work together. Let us be large in thought and small in action. What does one gain by acting in a small way, when one could be great in action. Our surroundings change our cultural identities, so focus on unification instead of uniqueness.

8456	 I think kids owe their parents everything because the parents brought them into this world and gave them life and kept them fed and sheltered and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay at home (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can drop what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives.
8457	 parents, who brought kids into this world, should be the ones deciding what kind of care kids should receive and what kids should do with their lives. if kids think that they should go home, they should go home. Caretakers do know better than kids. Mom's
8458	I agree that kids don't know what they're doing because kids are dangerous animals and could do any kind of harm to themselves and to other people, and even to their parents. But in some cases they get the shelter and the way to grow up they need to get this. I think kids should stay at home or as close to home as possible for their entire lives, because if the parent has a need, they could drop anything and act on the request, just like kids do with respect to their parents.

8460	YesAllWomen is uncontroversial. NoMovies has no right to comment on this image. That ad is a classic advertisement from 1976. Massive corporate hypocrisy. Men such as I, don't have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of "oppression" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued.

8465	 Japan must better protect themselves from China in the coming years in order to avoid war with China. Japan must better protect themselves from China in the coming years in order to avoid war with China. I agree. The Chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military, and i'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities commited by the japanese in ww2. The Japanese will not acknledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the Holocaust
8466	 I think the europeans need to protect themselves better against China.

They should never have wiped them out, they should have let things happen organically and without barbarism or warfare. Japan has been handed a few good knocks recently, by that means the Japanese need to protect themselves much more. China will always be the leader of Asia and in their current state will always be treated more then equals if their are threats then are not serious is just a Japanese idiocy.
8469	 I agree with Japan that they need to be safer from the influx of China. I know what can be done to do so. Japanese needs to use the US to their advantage. Yes, they need to be very careful with the joint military agreements the US has signed with china and avoid any big deal with china directly.  They need to strengthen their joint defense with military experts from the US to be able to defend themselves a lot better against the chinese.
8470	 Pretend that a piece of tape that is attached to your knee is removed when you walk. If your knee doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore, can you walk better? Here is why affirmative action is a bad idea. It tends to compare people who have pre-determined and unnecessary traits. Affirmative action can hurt students who are more qualified because they are a different color. It can also damage the reputation of schools that must follow a quota. If all students are qualified for the same scholarship, it doesn't mean that people of a certain skin color should get it.
8471	 "Diversification," defined as "a better makeup of a group to better serve the group's purposes or interests," is fairer and more objective. Diversity imparts new qualities to students, as opposed to solely accepting older qualities as intrinsic to a group. " Of course they are free to argue that white students can and should be valued and treated different than black or Hispanic students. But what Affirmative Action does is give disadvantaged students such a place on the education map they don't have before, and mainly, it's a matter of federal law:
8472	 It is always better to look at the individual merit, regardless of skin color. Students in need of financial aid should be funded to attend college regardless of their skin color. The last paragraph has been rewritten to clarify the intent behind the scholarship. Since everyone is born different, color is an inherent quality that cannot be determined. Some of the best students will be taken advantage of in a system that uses race as a factor. Some students are born without the physical ability to do well in college. They may also be in need of financial aid and still fail because of race if a school that doesn't want a certain color of person and decides they only have so much scholarships.
8473	I believe all college scholarships should be merit-based. students need. Scholarships should not be used to give students a handicap for demonstrating an undeserved stereotypical pattern. in an effort to provide diversity, some of this should be ensured on the balance of merit. I believe that Scholarships merit a college degree should be determined on the skill set of the applicant, as well as the educational needs of the school. In my experience, I have noticed that students who are not qualified sometimes apply for a scholarship because they have been incorrectly colored.
8474	 Affirmative action can help students who need it. It does not need to be equated to color. There is a link between a fair benefit given to all children and positive results. That connection is unearned, inherent, inherent. Students may not choose the color of their skin but they can choose what kind of academic success they seek. Coloring needy students does not go beyond skin color because all of them have it already. Some racial stereotypes might make children believe color is where they draw the line for citizenship.
8475	 Maybe people like my liberal stance, and feel better about politics and society as a whole. Don't encourage unions to be big. Unions are democratic and should be small, with fewer members that can be closely watched to see if they are taking money for hire from corporations. On the other hand maybe there are lots of liberal people who can tolerate the occasional racketeering to be able to practice their religious beliefs. That would mean that corporations can finance political campaigns. This could explain the amount of corporations making PACs.
8476	I've been thinking about the mass incarceration of black youth in the United States. It reminds me of a sad history of the people of Africa in this country.

8485	It is the politician's duty to research and determine if an unborn baby is living or dead. The first thing a doctor should do is determine if the fetus is living or dead. The next thing a doctor should do is think about the natural survival needs of the fetus. How close the baby is to birth, how old the baby is, the baby's health condition, is just as significant as dead.
8486	Yes, suicide is an issue for me. As I've stated in the other arguments I can understand that a person will choose to end their life and would want to help them in any way, but for me it's too late, a little too late. That being said, while I don't think we have a direct obligation to anyone to live, I believe we should respect the choice to die, but that's just me.
8487	 I am a complicated person. I struggle with this and really can't answer the question simply. I completely agree with you. For me, a human should be protected.

I've now changed my mind regarding abortion. this is due to the non denominational nature of my community. improved the question since i was considering shifting my comments
8489	Abortion is a evil practice to me, despite having made more than 3,000 abortions in my lifetime.    ### The text you submitted:  Just because a human cannot survive on its own, doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn't protect them.

8490	I don't like the concept that women consider themselves curvy because it portrays the idea that a person can not improve or be nicer to her body by losing weight.

The body that is already curvy from genetics is not a BMI measure of being overweight. Your waist will not change the same as your weight, and people of the same BMI will have different sized waists. I'm going to try to work to stop this practice of labeling women as being curvy when they are overweight by calling them fat and increase obesity awareness.
8491	And I understand that I may not have held the majority view, and I would say I didn't hold the majority of the views, but a man's penis is outside his body and most other species share that opinion. I would not regard that as considered to be a beauty. I saw that a lot of people made an assertion and I only wanted to respond to that. As a human I only live a short time in the world, you would be lucky to live 100 years anyway, so you would be lucky to live at all, and that means you are fortunate in an inordinate amount.
8492	To curvy women for fat women: I'm sorry to say fat because fat and curvy aren't the same thing. I do not disapprove of people being overweight. I am very thankful for your honesty and am responding so that I can have a larger discussion with you. There are curvy women who are extremely overweight. It should never be seen as a compliment. I see curvy as a compliment to a person with a shape that is natural and more attractive to me than most other looks. I'd be happy to listen to your advice!
8493	As a fat women, my body is curvy from all the fat that I have accumulated since I was young and now that I am in my 20's. I am fat, but I wouldn't be curvy. Fans of curvy would not be as judgmental and would actually love my body style, thus this would not be limiting in my life as curvy is. Curvy is overweight, but fat isn't curvy. Fat Women

The fossil record is evidence to support evolution. creationism is an insult to intelligent men and women who study and respectfully disagree with the mainstream. evolution has shown itself capable of comprehending the majority of issues. Who would you choose: evolution or creationism? evolution
8498	 We do not know the answers to such questions.However, modern clams are in layers above the fossilized ground. Many questions remain unanswered. However, the fossil record suggests that the Grand Canyon was not created in the way creationists believe and that it is more likely that we walked away from a volcanic campfire with our shoes on than that an alien creature chose to walk upright and fly around in outer space. The Grand Canyon was not created

8500	Girls deserve respect... The reality tv shows, like home repair, are the most parodies of women that on a daily basis are taken advantage of by large corporations who reap the benefits, while the broadcast companies do not, this is largely what is perpetuating the inequality of the number of women versus men in the workplace.
8501	The following is not complete code.   # This is not a complete solution. Try to make the code better!  Reality Tv is garbage... First of all it is scripted... just meant for amusment and it is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality tv shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.

8512	Yes, I am somewhat sad that I have to leave my family but I do understand that relationships change over time and I might find another family to stick with in the future. Yes, Family is important because one family sticks together even if they move. I understand that. I do not know if my new family will be similar to my family. Family can be defined by blood or affection. Family is important because we share a similar bond with each other.

It is calculated by knowing how much sex one has had with different partners. before........I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing. As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment. It seems when your new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/ different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside. It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation same positions, same girl, same everything....I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on not being able to keep your hands off eachother.

8542	Yes, you can I think that since video games and movies are all we really have to go on, is it truly possible to kill that which is already dead? you don't really know. I think that if something possessed the undead to come back to the land of the living, I don't think we will truly be able to kill them off, since they are dead to begin with, and not be able to be killed by our normal means.

8562	Exactly. It's possible that anyone is moral in his own way - the important thing is that he is valid in some way. Moreover, because someone's morality is dependant on context, he could be wrong in one situation and right in another, it all depends on what exactly he is doing.  With this in mind, it can be concluded that morality is a highly subjective term that can't be completely agreed upon, especially when applied to a living creature with no inherent rights.
8563	Not fair because she's a witch. or because she's a zombie. You're certainly allowed to bash someone for their physical traits or abilities. You just can't use those to as a way to defame them.  Moral Value

8571	These are the only two options for a player who is having trouble choosing a best shooter map and it's very understandable that you would be though. Battlefield has many great maps and games for you to choose from. So I personally recommend you playing something other than MW2. The need to protect and defend is what makes the story in MW2 so meaningful. You have three rounds of ammunition, which in battlefield is the amount of time you have in your hand to shoot. Take your time choosing your shot and don't make any hasty decisions to save the situation.

8573	Just kidding. Good enough. more people complain about the controls rather than the gameplay. but also bad company is boring because the vehicles are not maneuverable at all on heavy coats with weighted rotors.and the swivels for them are way too long.This may be influenced by multiplayer difficulties. the vehicles here you can just start running around even without crew and yawn, and you do not even have the luxury of doing so in real life where you could drive without thinking or worrying about other things. especially with the gameplay here,you get killed where the enemy could see or you wait for the grenade to land on you rather then being able to move to try and evade it the entire place is a chokehold and can not be fixed on multiplayer ,running around and still die from a heart attack from all the stress of life.  I am more likely to complain that the controls are bad than that the gameplay is bad.
8574	good company is heroic its a fun massive multiplayer battlefield where i spend hours and hours with people that i really like and its like a game made by a bunch of like minded people who get along very well talking about your fun vacations personal life or whatever and its far less focused on battle than mw2 is because once you get up into the air its more about flying than running with a bulldag around your neck. primarily focusing on atmosphere throughout the entire battlefield. response: bad company is boring its hard to kill people on there and the controls are weird the vehicles are boring and are hard to control for some reason also the maps are waaaaaaay to big.on cod the map called wastland is one of the biggest and people hate that map.mw2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering whats about to come from around that corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head or if your about to get hit by a thrown grenade but through all that that goes through your mind as your playing you get hit from behind and your down.battlefield is boring because you always no where the enemy is and you dont have to go get them you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone unlike on mw2 your thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed.plus weapons on mw2 are realistic except for the at4 which is not a guided munition.
8575	 To school uniforms belong the people that are not interested in learning from teachers and do not want to understand. Also, I don't think it is right that the school should have the right to wear uniforms.
8576	 Yes, it's easy to get some students into trouble because of what they wear. But if we were all to wear uniforms, people would see what is really important. Yes, people would consider you the pretty boy or the talented person who you are and the government wouldn't get their hands on our money as easily.
8577	 Besides making everyone look alike, school uniforms have other disadvantages as well. Most notably, they cause fights. That's what is supposed to happen, but I don't think it really happens. I'm against school uniforms.
8578	 School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
8579	 Schools should not wear uniforms because they are a violation of the concept that makes us all different. Uniforms shouldn't be a crime, because they shouldn't affect who we are as individuals and, therefore, shouldn't affect what we do.

8585	 What I would say is the price is great.  Food is almost as good as either Joe Shuster's or Mr. Deli - but for a lot less.   The next time I want a high-end hamburger (yes, I admit - I make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake) I could probably get a bigger burger here than at Joe Shuster's or Mr. Deli.   The service was decent, nothing extraordinary.   I will probably go back because it's really cheap.  I'd rate 4 stars, 4 stars

8612	To be stronger and more effective, change "the waiter/manager/someone" to "the hostess". Nice tool! increase visibility in this position. Try to be more consistent in what your customer thinks to you by changing the wording to not seem dismissive.  To be stronger, add ".to a friend as soon as possible." to be more apparent .to a friend as soon as possible." Try to tighten the final sentence to create a stronger message to the customer by removing more words that are not necessary to be clear. Try to hold the punishing tone and give a more agreeable tone for the more clients. Most of all, rephrase the entire thing.

8650	She would be sorry for what she did even before she got to know me and although I could sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did, it wouldn't make me forgive her and not turn her in.
8651	I understand why you killed her, but it's against the law. Do you need me to arrest you? Maybe I could have a different reaction if I believed you were truly remorseful.
8652	probably not, but I know that she could have made a different choice. I did not have to agree with her choice or think she was a bad person. If she told me the story that she killed her family then I probably would have made a different choice than her.
8653	I would probably turn her in to the police if she wasn't a regular customer on the chain. I would have to check with my workmates because they work together with the police and I can't trust that they'll listen to any persuasion, including mine.

8770	 Unless you really want to debate the science of evolution, you dont need to know or understand the scientific method. You just need to argue with logic to make a personal theological point. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. . This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just dont try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down.
8771	 This is not how science or my interactions with scientists generally are conducted. Scientists are serious and objective about science. At the same time they are always respectful of other views that can be scientifically discussed. they have been known to disagree. There are numerous journals and outlets that will carry this type of material and they will not publish them in very long order. Reread the original paragraph

8776	Yes, I am against porn. I think it's wrong and it's dirty as dirt. You can start asking me questions. If you want to see more about my opinion I suggest you go to http://noctoretali.wordpress.com
8777	If you ask me, porn is probably not really wrong. What is Wrong Is Not Putting Something out there that you do NOT really feel something towards. This is not right, cause I don't feel strongly towards something if I don't believe in it or it's not anything I honestly love.
8778	 No, but not all porn is the same. Someone watching football or happily tackling their laundry may just as easily be engaging in pornography but it won't be nearly as negative as watching the violent sexual conduct on the porn and almost certainly won't have as harmful effects on your life, your relationships, or your morals.  Please do not restrict this to comments, feel free to write your thoughts.
8779	Yes, the evidence is quite lacking. Nothing conclusive or conclusive enough really. I think the evidence is timpled more by those who think that their version of morality, what they think is "morally right", is the only version of morality that matters and that everybody else's version should simply be ignored.
8780	Why shouldn't you help out? None of the above choices . Just because you think it feels good to help, because nothing‚Äôs better than having the right motives and being good to others, makes no difference to help.  Some people have the wrong motives and it‚Äôs not just that they receive a sense of pride or rewards, it‚Äôs that they get a sense of power when they help out others.
8781	Now we feel good about helping out to people around us when it does make them feel good to help out as well. So when helping out to others, you not only contribute to the common good, but as well as your own morale and well-being. This shouldn't be an either/or situation. It is a two-way street.
8782	Because you care what happens to others. because they care about you as well, they want to help you. Often times people who help the common good either volunteer for a lot of hours or give up time from their own work to help out. their efforts go unnoticed, you never really think about the effort that goes into the common good.
8783	When asked why people help, they say, "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance.

8786	Yes, everyone is an important person. Nobody is more important than someone. There isn't any hope for a better world if everyone thinks they're the most important person in the world. Everyone should think about others before themselves.
8787	 I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
8788	advancing the common good would be better in the long run. we are all connected in ways beyond our natural control. the only thing that is beyond our control is our own thoughts and ideas.

8790	 Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are horrible they are still our kin.
8791	 It is possible that a kid doesn't have a father in their life they are just adopted father or even a step father. Think about if a mom is there for her kid it doesn't matter how lousy her dad is she is still her kid. she still acts like a kid not only she is her kid because her dad is bad and not because she doesn't have a father.
8792	although your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality
8793	 The father might be your best friend. But he can still be your worst enemy if he is the person to blame. A person can be or seem to be their opposite.
8794	 One shouldn't focus too much on arguing with their own parents when they are in the midst of facing issues. It's not easy to get rid of them in some ways and most of the time it is definitely the worse option.
8795	And then you say "I grew up without a father" and there is no one there to respond to. No one has to know anything about you, including your dad. A child should never be raised without a father. How does growing up without a father affect a person? "a child should never be raised without a father."
8796	Good title for a news video, "Me Without Dad". me without dad make less money than women at the same age and with the same education. one or both of the young woman's parents did not consider her an economic success. not enough information close to you without the need to venture across city or country limits. I do some drifting, which includes being homeless, but I also get by with all the other resources my parents do not offer like my nice car, safety net and etc
8797	 A dad is better than no dad. A dad is better than no dad. A dad is better than no dad. Yes. A dad is better than no dad. Yes. daddy No. daddy No. Not as good as this Not as good as this The best I could get was No. Yes.
8798	 father is better than nothing instead of father is better to have a father than to not have a father and that shouldn't happen no one should grow up without a father because honestly it messes with kids in school and everyone would be glad to see dads for grown ups when they had kids would get no love no father and it would be the pits everyone would know it was just what a child should grow up without father would be very sad no one ever realized the damages the little kid would suffer should no father be around father are better than nothing and that shouldn't happen
8799	 I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore
8800	 The uncles have been with me all my life. If I had a father I would have the uncles always to look to instead of my father. I will grow up fatherless. I would rather have a lousy father than not having a father at all.
8801	I would rather have a lousy father than fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all
8802	fatherless is unhealthy.   Police cars with sirens on began to appear all over the city. With each passing moment the safety of the cars seemed to be in danger. The doors to the police cars started to open up and the cars accelerated and began to zoom around the city. The windows were prayed towards each other and even though the danger was felt by everyone the cars could be seen to be unnecessary.
8803	If I were to be fatherless, I would prefer to have a father figure that makes mistakes than not to have one at all. I would like to grow up having a father figure that makes mistakes, rather than having no father at all.
8804	fatherless: I would prefer fatherless, who I know what father I have, rather than fatherless who I don't know who my father is. ##: I wouldn't, probably. fathers who passed away: I wouldn't, probably.
8805	Water bottle usage, although maybe a leading corporate industry, is not worth making the environment worse than it already is. These bottles will not start to decompose for another 2 years.
8806	Water use is not necessary, but these bottles will decompose after 700 years.
8807	We should get rid of single use plastic for all the time. The plastic used to make these bottles decomposes far slower than paper or glass, and the best action we could take is to return bottles, especially plastic bottles, to the recycling program. Single use

8870	 I find most religions extremely stupid. Most people follow the philosophies and beliefs of their parents and are logical only in situations that do not involve religious dogma or reliance on Allah. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who twist logic to fit their religious beliefs. They're intelligent and more truthful than many but can be very frustrating, and you'll have to watch out for them.
8871	 Christianity is not logical nor reasonable. Christianity is a religion of faith. It does not allow for any logical thought. Christianity is completely irrational. Christianity is only the opinion of people living in a certain time and place who are not really themselves. Christianity is better to see as a state of mind than a Christian religion. Christianity is merely useful in that it is a topic that provides for discussion and an established idea of a fixed idea of the other all-encompassing definition of the deity. Christianity is the master of words. Christianity is a religious test and even more religious practice than atheism is. Christianity is irrational and misleading:
8872	 Most religions absolutely ridiculous and illogical, the only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views.

8890	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.

8894	Parents should use only aversive tactics when it's necessary, but are not encouraged to overdo it.
8895	I think spanking should be used if they are doing something that should have been done or usually not done and it should be a minimum but and as the child have to decide on their own if they are going to obey a rule that you are set and forgoing punishment and immediate consequence to not be punished gives them more freedom and gives the child less control over themselves and not keeping them in line most
8896	 spanking    should    be    used    if    it    will    teach    them    in    the    long    run    but    each    child    responds    differently    to    different    punishments    while    one    child    just    telling    them    no     or    grounding    them    will    work    on    another    child    .
8897	spanking should be used if it will teach your child the lesson he's needed in but it may take them a spank one, two or more times before the lesson is learned and of course all children are different.
8898	I would say some drugs or just ground them for a few days each time so their attention will be on you instead of growing on drugs.
8899	 I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
8900	I would spank a child if I were ever in a position to

8956	Having a "civil union" isn't actually a good thing - it's simply a way for some people to get around the ban on gays. Having several advocates arguing for options may slightly reduce the problem, but won't really do anything. Undermining of assumptions? What assumptions? Law that has developed over hundreds of years isn't undermined by gay marriage, in fact I think it facilitates it. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST MY IMPRESSION, DO NOT GIVE MY LITTLE COMPUTER NAME INLINE AGAIN!! should never change... to tribes & slavery
8957	 Addressed usage: "Our society is a modern society that has developed over hundreds of years and has rules that guarantee a voice for every person. You are the reason that a human being would attempt suicide, because we do not want you on our shores." Use quotes to outline the speaker‚Äôs sentiment, but avoid lengthy quotes, as they have been read twice. "As with using the word "genetic engineering," we have overused the word "computer" to describe things like "microsurgery," which just uses less words, but gets the same message. ### General best practices on conversations:
8958	 I'm not saying we make our marriages official or even legally recognized....but can we at least let gay people use the bathrooms, washrooms, and lockers as us "normal" people would? That way, it'll show a 'brand of equality'.  If they become a family and eventually want to marry one another, it'll be a separate legal matter entirely. I'm not against gay people wanting to build their families in ways that are opposite of what most people expect, or in ways that some people define as 'love.'
8959	 This idea is basically playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, than law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?

8965	 personal pursuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am
8966	 All the things we do are because we take care of others first. Person first is means care about others for self. Every people take care of others. For that we just take care of others and hope others care about us back. Person first is a way to make life better by making lives better.
8967	 Personal Payfoward because nothings would change without us. We need to be sure to take care of the other the most. Global advancement is going to happen on the personal pocket if only we all focus on that. Instead of thinking about myself first I will try to think about others in more ways. Global advancements will begin to take place to make the world less dangerous and safe for us to live in. I will start to get together with a group to help the public better so everyone would be better off with out us
8968	 Personal pleasure: I will choose this because this is the only word describing true selfishness. You can only think of yourself without thinking of anyone else. There is no good reason to take this choice. I think the words personal pleasure is not the word to describe selfishness.
8969	 I will choose personal as it is better in everyway. We both know that we think of ourself. But now i see things different. Yes i feel that, but here is a better way of thinking about it. I think its better for both of us if i am happy. No one is better or wrong than another. The result is better.

In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.
8974	 survival is an advantage as long as we use reason to determine our thinking. We must not over use it. After 3 or 4 times of a trauma our body will respond in a more normal way of not reacting the way we normally do. Overreacting to most people is a trait of a subnormal persons condition
8975	 I'm a good person. This is pretty self-explanatory, doesn't it? This is probably how most people would want to present this information. I learned something from the pole-vaulting challenge. I'm a better person now because I set a personal goal for myself.
8976	 As I continue to work toward my personal goals, it has taught me so much that it has made me a better person. I have learned how to trust the community more, and in the process, been responsible, obedient, and trustworthy.  Build confidence in your pursuits
8977	I want to be the best pole vaulter, or a better pole vaulter than i can possibly be. I want to be the best pole vaulter in the world, and I want to be a better person. I want to be good at this to grow as a person.
8978	I like your idea of trying to be the best pole vaulter or the best at anything else. It sounds good. Keep trying. I still want you to try and think what you are going to do. Good luck! You can use the ideas that we discussed in class
8979	personally I've learned that pursuing goals... Everyone can be the best person they can be. Pursuing a goal will encourage you to become the best you can be. Just do your best. The best way to support other people's personal goals is to have your own goal of achieving excellence.
8980	 context vagueness of the dimension. Specifically, including too much context would dilute the focus. How many things should we do for the common good when we take time off for breaks? Probably less. Even more important is the context in which the ideas were proposed. I think that everyone should do things that make them happy or improve their skills and have fun instead of addressing the other dimension, i.e., "all I want is to improve my status in the political system"
8981	 I want to be less selfish, do what makes me feel better. However I want to do some for myself. Good luck on the exam. What's this argument about? There is no unambiguous theme to the argument.
8982	 In a work setting  you make yourself look good so that you will get more money for example. But for the average person, when they are out on the street, interacting with society, they have a short term, seen [expletive] _thinking think_ of the long term in that instance we just want to get by and. We are living in the real world.
8983	 What you want us to do is be less selfish, but then also understand that everything we do has consequences. It can be bad consequences, but also good. I think what we should do, is actually give more to charities, organizations and things that are advancing the common good.  I do not own that property
8984	 For me its not like anything that I think the answer to. I agree with me being as much selfish as possible to make myself as much money as possible. Im sure it would make me proud to think that I made more money than anyone else on the planet, even though it may not be the nicest thing in the world to do.
8985	 We are here to help others because we believe helping others can make us more fulfilled. We want to be the one who can change the world for the better so we can go back to helping others in the future.
8986	 I think personal pursuit because i believe that more people who are helped after they become better they in turn help others. People who help others have a better image of themselves.
8987	 Trust yourself to succeed. You have that strength and inner strength that can help yourself and achieve your goals. You have to have confidence in yourself.You want to succeed. Having confidence in yourself will help you reach the common good.
8988	 Not smarrre it before helping others People will help you if you're ready to help, not smarrre it before helping others. You have to be kind to be helpful.

8990	She doesn't have much to worry about legally because the DA didn't even consider a case, but she still doesn't know what's going to happen in civil court. A neice wouldn't make much progress in civil court.  She might have to return a car that wasn't hers, but as she doesn't know it's not hers, that's not worth the hassle. If she has a car she should give it back. That is the up to her, and he probably doesn't want to get involved in family dispute

Definitely stick to paying him back cash for the accident." Hand him cash for his mess that he messed up." Yes, go ahead and give him the cash and let him clean up the mess, but don't pay for a messes mistakes as though they were kindness.
8993	She's much better off signing an agreement that the mother and neice will testify for her in a civil action against the mother and the neice.'  her mother's driven away and does not want to take sides, and her grandmother will now be in prison, along with the death sentence for the young woman.' But hey if the DA was so inclined, she would have no problem hiring her lawyer and a few associates to press charges to prosecute for adultery, revenging herself on all of the degenerate men whom she has slept with.
8994	If they lose a big civil case and have money, the DA could prosecute him in case they would win the criminal case.  That makes sense to me. it may be possible to prove some type of sham, thus not triggering criminal charges. he might do anything he can to help her out in the court house even if they can't win any contracts or dealings. Just because he can't act against her will, he might really like it if he's really close with her grandma. No
8995	 elsewhere in this challenge, assert that police aren't nearly as good as what they should be, but at least not as bad as they are. elsewhere in this challenge, aim to make the police work more effectively, or at least to put the problem on the right track.
8996	 Yes, it's safer to be involved in community policing. Yes, I agree with your statement. Yes, I agree that more people should be engaging in the Neighborhood Watch movement. Yes, I would like to be involved in the Neighborhood Watch movement Yes, I would like to be involved in community policing Yes, it makes sense to me Yes, community policing makes sense to me Yes, I think more people should engage Yes
8997	 Allows police to be given more powers, more responsibility for more crimes and a proportionate increase in pay (commensurate to all other states). not enough information follow that would make better sense and fit the text
8998	 that police be empowered to carry out police duties also means that their citizenry has to empowe them accordingly. That is, citizens have a responsibility to police and every citizen has to be aware of their duties to police as well as each other.
8999	I think police chiefs and other police officials need to be accountable to laws rather than congress. I believe citizens have a right to see themselves represented at the highest levels. policing should be completely separate from the police department and run on a volunteer basis.
9000	 Women worldwide have been subject to and often raped, denied the right to education, forced into illegal abortions, forced into marriage and child abuse, and starved. This violence can result in child abuse, sexual abuse, marriage abuse, trauma and even death. Prostitution should be legalized to help women liberate themselves from these vices.
9001	  criminal behavior causes harm to society so if it is allowed to occur over time, harm can eventually be caused. prostitution should not be legalized because it causes harm to society and therefore should remain illegal. criminal behavior should be prevented by police and other regulatory mechanisms if they do not exist. If others are victimless, why is it necessary to punish them for their actions?

9003	     We would be unreasonable if we didn't enforce laws to prevent people from making the same choice that is harmful to society.  Example question: What argument would be most inappropriate for solving the problem? prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.
9004	 The violation of prostitution laws should be prevented, as well as all other violation of laws regarding a crime against society. And the police should investigate and prosecute, if the crime is committed. Finally, the government should make sure that all violators get the appropriate penalties. There is a crime done to society when individuals in a group oppose a government entity or find itself itself at odds with its law, just as well as when individuals influence some people to commit a crime.
9005	Yes it is illegal in the USA.

9006	No it's illegal. In the USA only about 2 states and about 10 hospitals approved the treatment. It means insurance can't cover that type of drug. It can be done, but consider the possibility of problems with the medications, customs and postal inspector, it is probably illegal.   Also make the following changes:  # I know for a fact that the drug company making the drug is selling the drugs just a little bit higher than retail price for profit so ignore it if you don't want to hear about them. $17 for the 20 mg meds might as well be $30. price up if you want.

9010	 Your basic legal rights are well protected under the Tenant's Rights Act, and if you do have a problem, you will be entitled to get a court injunction against him. This is (usually) your first time renting, so if your landlord refuses to return your deposit, it is pretty straightforward - write a letter of demand and try to get the landlord to give you your money back. Paying your rent, even if you're the landlord, is a common courtesy. Consider that you will probably need to be able to explain to your children and friends and neighbors and future landlord what you did to make it look so good, and that they can be funny about it.
9011	 If you are paying rent, you should let him get his money and keep your ID. Take out a new credit card and go to a different place, change the locks, make all your payments upfront to the new place and change all your stuff back over. You also shouldn't feel bad about it, if they never paid you back they deserved the loss. But if he actually wants to take your ID and your deposit, say bye byes (what a loser!) and ignore them.

9014	You should pay the deposit to the landlord since you did the job. You gave the deposit as a sign of your respect. Get someone else to fix the gutters instead of just ignoring them. You did not do the work yourself. Get someone else to install the gutters. Pay the landlord his deposit, if you can. Get a new tenant with respect for your place. Pay to get the damage fixed. Know your rights. Get someone to fix the sprinklers and you can keep your deposit, or find a tenant that can pay you that. Pay the landlord what your give him at that time.

9020	education is what makes us act/believe/be the people we are/are the way we act/believe/be, rather than being dictated by our society.  It is also important to have a strong moral foundation as there are so many negative influences surrounding us in today‚Äôs society.  We need to start here, then if schools are to be accountable to the public they have to start teaching these things.
9021	 This argument has been edited because the factual information provided was insufficient to justify changes to the body text. On the day that you should write an essay on a controversial topic, keep the truth in mind. Instead of committing an error by using an ad hominem attack: The passage you wrote was good overall. First, considering that the author has family issues that are complex and difficult, I would accept whatever decision he made on the topic, and not base my opinion on a case of a made up story you may not believe in yourself.  So in that light, you are probably better off. However, one of the worst things you can do is use your unfounded judgements to make assumptions about others to the extent that it overpowers your logic, which is what you have done in this case.
9022	 To set a uniform standard.  Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by.  You are correct that it is a matter of belief.  It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children.  Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or like a child, we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us.  At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good).  Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler.  Legislators try to take the middle path.

9030	  guns should be confiscated to those who own them now due to high likelihood of serious violence and death. guns should be confiscated to those who own them now due to high likelihood of serious violence and death. now in my personal opinion, guns are bad. they should be used only by law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens, confiscating guns is a good idea. confiscating guns is a good idea. assigning the gun to some people is probably necessary. assign the gun to some people is probably necessary. reassign the gun to police officers so that they will be able to use it carefully. police officers should know how to use the gun carefully.
9031	  I don't own a gun, but I wouldn't use one. I think guns should be reserved for the police, and that play use of guns should be restricted. I feel extremely bad for my brother because he was wrongfully killed and my mind is still haunted by the thought that I could have made it the same way if I had had a gun. Many citizens want to use guns to defend themselves, but I don't think that would be a good idea.   Now, I don't own a gun, but I would probably not use one. While I'm very glad to see that some people actually use guns for good and safety, I do feel that purchasing a gun on the black market is a crime against humanity.

9033	  We suggest you write an argument about guns. From your research, you may have found an issue with using guns for sport and recreation. A fake gun cannot be "responsible" for injury and violence. That is not what this argument is about. None of your friends own a gun. You feel that it's unfair to endanger any of them. As with the gun reports on TV, not everyone who intends to have a fake gun intended to do harm to others. In fact, most paintball or airsoft enthusiasts intended to play, having fun! Such practices are meant to be purely for fun, not to cause harm to others. We realize many people enjoy fighting games, but it's still a game -- a game that is dangerous if not played in a proper manner. Another problem with paintball guns is that many people are not well trained on how to handle them and cannot take proper precautions. As a result, injuries and even deaths can occur. Unlike a real gun, a paintball gun cannot be shot by those who intend to have a "safe" game. The man, Tye Howser, had a reason to own a gun and consequently died. This is not the point of the argument. A fake gun cannot be "responsible" for injury and violence, like what happens with paintball guns
9034	  I'm just saying that guns should stay out of the hands of normal people.\n\n we should keep firearms for police officers only.   Sometimes even paintball guns can be very dangerous. The worst thing that can happen is a lot of people get badly injured and killed. so I'm against the idea of actually owning a paintball gun. These facts are probably the same as yours. that would make us less safe to live. Anyways, guns aren't all bad or good.

9041	 Yes, you can be reimbursed for your jail time if convicted and you are sentenced to a jail time.  This is called payback jail.

9047	 Lawyers are human beings like you and I and, sometimes they just screw up. The law needs lawyers to decide if this is worth their time or not and you do need them to decide your case. Ultimately it takes a team and it all depends on what you are trying to achieve. But, that is the only way it can be done and, if this is your only option then at least you know it is your choice to have them decide.
9048	  The students will interpret this based on what they know about law and civil matters. To make the students understand the arguments above, the instructor should first state why lawyers are interested in civil matters. the majority of money earned by lawyers comes from civil matters. then she should explain the reason why lawyers want to ask these important questions. she should mention that some of the most important questions from lawyers are: These questions help lawyers decide if they are worth their time.
9049	 Yes lawyers are trying to make you money but, the bottom line is their pocket-book, not yours!!! So, this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big but, the lawyers assume lots of risk in civil matters--which in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So, before lawyers touch many civil cases they will pose some really important questions, i.e, is this a winnable case and is this worth my time--considering how much I (lawyer) could potentially earn?

9052	What do you think? I don't know who would want to be gay today. If you do meet one, do take him or her. Love does not look sexier than you. I think homosexuality is a sin. I wouldn't want my wife to be gay. I don't think marriage should be something that defines you.
9053	It is one thing to make a sense of my question, but making it clear, the license you get when you get married is only one aspect to the definition of marriage. This is part of our basic human rights. Marriage definition should be based on non religious setting and not cover other things like sexual orientation.
9054	Civil marriage is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is in its very nature controlled by the government and government thus has the right and responsibility to define it. I don't think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage.

And that most people work hard all their lives for a measly paycheck. AND their dues to the state and federal governments. This bill requires that you work harder because the government will work harder for you.
9106	Well, the biggest threat to liberty and freedom in the US today is taxation (Marianne Williamson: Forbidden Truth, chapter 6, under "Percentage of the Bill the Government Steals from Us Through Taxation").  Proposing someone else "to pay for" your stuff is, no doubt, more labor efficient, but that's only what you think.  Any person who truly values liberty will find this discouraging to the point of "umm-ing" if he or she is so used to it that he or she complains about "taxation" as a "stigma."

9113	Yes, there are instances in which you cannot stand family but there are also many situations where you would not want the state to know as well.  It is your duty to report something like this!

9120	Oh no, this wouldn't be in their best interest, and they should stay off the pregnancy thing for a while.  Let other people be pro-lifers, and then they can do whatever they want, but you have to be pro-life as an individual, whatever circumstances you are in.
9121	They are pro-life with the same level as me, but they are willing to support me. They are pro-life, but you don't have to be in it either. Their opinion could be different from their feelings about the situation.
9122	The Abortion thing... she didn't say the thing that could have been of that, she said this other stuff that could have been of that. She should have apologized if she could have pulled her quote up so that you could look at it rather than relying on what she said it is.  The Abortion thing... She doesn't even deserve a response, she uses the "I'm not like everyone else" argument she doesn't even deserve a response.
9123	I'll agree to that if the other woman gets pregnant in a way that keeps her family together.  But I'm really less sympathetic to that even then, unless it's a case of medical need, because that's another issue.  Even then, I guess that's okay, but not generally.  Of course they would if they got in a position where they didn't want a child.  When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion.
9124	A lot of pro-life supporters would have you think they had a hard time with getting pregnant in the first place, but not, actually.  Because the pro-lifers they were told, "what if..."
9125	So yes, the people talked about in this passage are indeed illegal aliens who have now broken the law. That illegal action cost a current employer and current government some money - that's the point. The employer paid a fine that was and is still legally required, and the laws they broke were reintroduced with them being deported.
9126	You and I would continue to protest against this and we would remain in the country despite the current laws ($250,000 plus jail time and deportation isn't necessarily what's going to happen, anyways). However, we don't want to be a part of all the fighting. We think this community office is a good idea, so we will keep protests and criticism to ourselves for now.
9127	 That isn't what I said. What I said is to be able to apply for a green card, and stay in the US as long as you like. There are also businesses where they take undocumented workers for lesser pay and do not have to pay taxes at all. It is all about timing.
9128	 Although I agree with the author, I'm afraid he will feel very uncomfortable using this form of passive aggression against an illegal immigrant. I'm not sure that it was the best decision to speak rudely about illegal immigrants and I would not encourage anyone else to do that unless they truly think they should be free to do so.
9129	 Undocumented workers have many rights under federal law. They are regulated by laws to ensure that they are providing the type of labor that's expected of them. They are helping the economy to grow by working hard. What do you think? No one is arguing about the legality of immigration.  In fact, they just want to point out that illegal workers break the law if they don't work at least 30 hours per week.
9130	Well-regulated organizations make better decisions, so bad decisions are less likely to be made. You are likely to make better decisions if you are aware of your risk of making a bad decision.

They are not to be printed and/or utilized by predators, rapists, thieves, extortionists, etc. Don‚Äôt immediately go for the police. Instead, change your locks and tell her you aren't welcome back. Especially not when you see a lot of other people at a place.
9136	 Tell her to get counseling for her behavior. Disengage from her and avoid contact. Skip her at parties. Don't offer support if she asks about the money. Don't consider that you 'mentored' or helped her. Leave if she tries to blackmail you. Prevent future theft. Don't be afraid to talk to the police about her. Take her to court and get her charged.
9137	 What did she need it for?  Nope...we never would've taken money just to pay for drugs. That would've seemed horrible. She needs to have her cake and eat it, and get some perspective, and you need to focus on the future, not on dealing with the past. The bottom line is, do not take the money. Everything will be better tomorrow. Be reasonable. If the money is a gift, explain that you want to return it.
9138	Again, I know this is not the best line of action, but it's the only way to get through this.  You know you have to have the funds to repay her.  If you can't do that, then either you can find a way to pay more money to her or reduce the benefits you provide to her family-member. As of yet you have done nothing about her taking the money without your knowledge.
9139	 You can also make threats of legal action to be more direct.      ### Consequence:  If nothing seems to work, talk with your close family members and advise them to work things out. If they refuse to cooperate, the only way to finally resolve the problem is to report them to the authorities. That's your choice. No matter what you decide to do, you will need to set boundaries.
9140	This argument is a critique of the government for restricting the use of natural herb. The government argues that it is harmful because it allows the oil lobby to make money. This is not true. It could be dangerous because an unregulated supply could cause an increase in the price of oil, resulting in higher inflation. ### The original argument: The government of Sweden argues that while many countries have legalised the use of weed for medical purposes, and even cigarette smoking laws have been relaxed or even abolished, the law is still in force so it is very harmful to the state because even schools have declined to introduce the product because of its legality.
9141	A legalised medical marijuana use will also be beneficial for the companies who make products for everyday living such as bathtubs and tubs as well as the businesses who produce goods like tyres that use the oil. Additionally, the oil companies will have to pay lower tax because the oil can be used to fuel cars. When customers purchase bigger cars they are required to pay more tax.
9142	Cultivate it at home and smoke it freely! In the controversial stance, marijuana was illegal because: the oil can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law. So that nobody would realise they were restricting the use of hemp.
9143	 Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere. It is a simple natural herb, which provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. ### Explanation: It is advised to try to make argument more logical.
9144	 The marijuana lobby doesn't want the oil from the seeds to be used for fuel. They should be prevented from gaining that kind of profit, so they are trying to change the law. They also would rather the people continue to keep in the dark, and want to continue to make profits. They would like to make sure that people think the oil from the seeds is not good for anything.

9150	 Well, if the government did have the power to make such laws, it is inefficient and certainly not within the responsibilities of such a law.  At least not without also haveing the ability to make laws to coordinate such actions as well. the laws permit some flexibility in such matters.   With regard to decency, honesty, and civility and clothing, what can we say is that
9151	Federal, local and states government should be careful when making laws regarding the color of clothing worn by an individual without the anticipation that they would be accepted. These laws should reflect the balance between the respect to others and dressing to be comfortable. Most states now have long been able to fix their own fiscal terms of service of the judicial system which much of the federal government does not.
9152	 The federal government may not assume responsibility for the application of rules to any form of public or private citizens' lives unless the entity acts on the nature of clothing. Society has clearly developed a new and more liberal view of personal liberty and has a greater acceptance of those people who do not conform to the standardization of mass production in fashion world. Formulate a sentence about each part of this piece: argue that laws that make clothing a matter of personal choice in any of the above ways are just that , laws .
9153	 The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control.  States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions.  By and large such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. a. establishment of 2 ways in which conformity and diversity differ . Establish the difference between conformity and diversity in dress in society
9154	States and localities have discretion to make law within their jurisdiction. They can make highly selective political laws regarding dress.  This is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores. The federal government should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style. We must also be realistic regarding laws that impact pluralism and freedom of speech. Your results may be different due to different computer programs you are using.

9157	 I don't know. This probably occurs during cold or harsh winter season in America; I'm sure your father or someone you know has had some experience with it. It's rare but not unheard of. Typically, however, it is not as intensive or as serious as what can happen in UK. We mostly see this during the daytime in US whereas the British people will spend a lot more hours huddling in their bedrooms with the heaters on full blast and drinking copious amounts of hot chocolate so that they can survive this  weird British winter.
9158	 The Saudis, not the UK, should have our money. My reaction would be, "Follow your dreams! Should my tax dollars go to expensive cars and castles, instead of feeding my children, so they can pursue their dreams?" Oh, wow, your grammar is atrocious. Are you perhaps the Canadian already? Just as a heads up for aspiring writers - the Dutch, not the UK, should have our money. I say to future employers - we should give him his job back and let him live in his own country.

9162	He should go about his business unscathed and let the individuals go to jail if they choose to. This response may not be very acceptable to the authorities or some of his neighbors.

Alternatively, if the mother had been found in contempt of court she would have lost custody and the child would not have the parenting rights or even the birthright to her by their own father. A little bit more thought may have saved her the grief that can be caused by strife within her society. Why do we not believe the child for the moment and just see the children's perspective and enjoy their innocence while they can
9170	The idea is that fewer people read the Bible, and fewer know the Bible is a literal, ancient, reliable, quoted text. Although modern theology is largely a product of 300 years or less, older philosophers are sometimes misrepresented or unable to express themselves clearly, because of modern-day publishing practices.  300 years may be too short to produce something truly worthy.  Fewer people read the Bible because of all the other science books and ‚Äúsubstitute truth‚Äù things that are printed.

9180	why should homosexual acts be wrong because they are not natural due to assumptions which are fallacious. First, homosexual acts are not natural. The world is full of feminine forms of various species of animals, among which are species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles and fungi. All these forms of animals are seen as normal and fit to lead a normal life. This proves that the existence of the feminine form of a human being does not detract from the possibilities of a normal and uneventful life. Secondly, homosexual acts cannot be rational unless we assume homosexuality is a logical consequence. Despite certain arguments that homosexuality is an incapacitating condition, it does not seem that reducing one's sexual freedom to homosexuality is a logical consequence.
9181	Homosexuality is not natural. Vaccines are natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are natural, and they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic. ######################################################################################## Mode of arguing: Argument of reason, showing a moral decline within the Mideast. In the 1920s, the Mideast was progressive, yet after the 1979 revolution, many cultures spread their ideals of a society that decayed into society that became more conservative. Find a region that is progressive, and a region that is more conservative. How have these two areas changed over time.
9182	Homosexuality is morally wrong because such behavior is at odds with scripture as well as with observable reality. Scripture makes specific statements about God and human relationships (see 2 Peter 1:4) and consistently teaches that they do not agree with the worldview of homosexuality. Additionally, such behavior also clearly upsets natural sexual order, and thus is at odds with natural morality. There is a counterfeit double standard in this society that some homosexual individuals feel it is acceptable and others feel it is oppressive to openly affirm what they believe. The idea of Christians who practice homosexuality and non-homosexual Christians who condemn them is based on a conceptual and ethical defect not found in any of the other four attributes listed in Clause One
9183	If something is wrong its not natural: I would expect there to be a better reason. Whether this is a perceived moral or immoral reason will depend on what I believe in. So this is just wrong. With the above suggested alterations, the argument should be more logical and easier to grasp. homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic."); });  });
9184	Homosexuality is an immoral act. Christian behavior is shown as immoral if it provides a logical reason to do so. Sexual activity without a logical reason is still part of human nature. Homosexuality does not provide a logical reason to do so. They can find no reason and cannot justify the act as described in the bible. It is their own bad behavior and there is no logical reason for them to do it. A person is free to choose who they want to be with and the act of choice is immutable.

The EU has agreed to not buy gas from Russia and to shift to LNG. Why should not the EU buy gas from Russia? because Russia does not have international borders with neighbours, and therefore cannot receive and export any natural gas and cause losses due to pipeline damages, etc.. That is why LNG is the best solution.

We as a nation have gotten more attention than WBC should be and should study this. I understand what motivates them but that shouldn't define us. I'll take the nice attitudes, the kindness, and the hopefulness instead of the madness from these people and, hopefully, add to it. Despite what people want, we should analyze what motivates extremists so that we, as a society, can care about one another and, hopefully, help them to better themselves, too.

9202	Just a theory, but extremists are very dangerous, and I'm not saying I think they should exist, but every other theory has to be brought to the table before we can debate realistically in such a way to understand the issue. They have these weird mentalities that make us think, and we don't know how to deal with that. Think about how we deal with islamic fundamentalism, and its extremists are much more like a bully who is getting you and forcing you to do things that you don't want to do. If we actually removed the jihad from the west and destroyed these "cults", what would we know? As a topic, we could explore it further. Removing extremists in certain situations.
9203	The WBC would go away because WBC is intolerant. I wouldn't mind the extremists and liberals ruling the world. I think the extremists are sick and that there's a reason behind it. I think one thing that these days should do, if we are to control the masses is to analyze extremism. We could then utilize this information to protect the community from its effect on the masses. They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong. So we analyze and we find out what makes them tick, and then we control the masses.
9204	 We have a lot to learn from extremists. After all, if we can't take something like extremism, what on earth can we learn from. so we can learn from them. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong.we should take the extremist movement.  I'm very curious why do you think we study the extremes?   make better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society

9206	 A friend from my high school and I got into a argument when a 34 year old teacher from our high school was sexting a student (she was sexting back). I failed to see the big deal seeing as there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up with a belief that age did not matter when intimacy was involved. Not only was she pissed off when I expressed this belief but all the other girls in the group text. Why am I wrong?
9207	 My dad is 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother older than my mom as well. I should have talked about it sooner, as it really would have been a big deal to me. I miss a gigantic group of friends, but I know that my dad will become even older until he dies and mom will age while growing in stature from what he did for her.

9210	  This argument's content is overly simplistic. It expects that global solutions to problems will break from the prevailing capitalist framework. That is unrealistic, both for capitalism itself and for humanity. Global-scale solutions to problems like inequality should require global-scale structures and forces. Such force of change could best emerge from revolutionary change, not from progressive change. It is not enough to demand that businesses be more transparent and participatory to create systemic change, but we must end capitalism's dualistic nature, while simultaneously sustaining a free market and a dynamic system of small-scale economies.

I am amazed that the United States, in a world-famous country for its widespread freedom of speech and its civic commitment to ideals of justice, liberty, and equality, actually has a vast majority of its citizens who agree that our system needs to be radically reformed. I agree. But how can we fix the world with today's leaders? This process will take many years and it may not be successful, so how can we fix the world with today's leaders? I agree.
9212	When I am not poor, I will read more books that relate to global problems. That is the correct direction for me to take, but I know that is not all we as humans have to do. I believe that I can make a difference in my actions and daily life.  Follow example #1, except skip the questions after step 2. For step 2 and all steps, do the following: Answer: Read the 'Limits to Growth,' by E.F. Schumacher. Do the following:
9213	  It is now 2000 and capitalism has done its work to increase inequality and escalate environmental problems as it is now obvious that fossil fuels have run out and economic growth is only what the earth's new state can sustain. Oil executives today hold almost zero opinion on limiting growth. Their world is now wealthier and their profligate spending keeps them at the top of the food chain. Even if the oil industry produces more oil in the next few years, oil pricing can only rise and does not even begin to address the fact that this planet needs us all to act now to avoid its profound ecological consequences.
9214	Capitalism is a positive force in the world today, which needs to be protected from its critics. My former employers were good examples of that. I want my current employers to be just as open-minded as they were in my former career. So, I created my job position to help companies improve their business by attracting and retaining great employees. I'm very proud of my job.

My opinion is that drivers should be at least 18, as teens seem to put themselves in danger on the road and should avoid risk taking. raise driving age to 18 Instead, they should be driving. Teens need to act as responsible drivers and will be all the more likely to think before they act, the older they get.  raise driving age to 18

But that does not mean that mp3s are perfect for a car stereo system. Lazisoft would need proper experimental controls (orange arrows), not mp3s, if he could isolate and eliminate the slightest noise or inconsistency in mp3s. He might turn out to be right in being able to hear any difference between a 192 kbps and a 256 kbps version.

9253	Hi everyone,    After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body.    Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.
9254	Hi everyone, <3 I think EU might be dissolving - every member state is going to be paying more attention to elections to see if they can take control of some of the powers of the EU. I think the prices for oil and cars will increase. I don't think EU will resolve any problems by themselves and it would probably take a few years for something good to happen. It sounds really stupid, but it could be interesting. :) I hope that you enjoy this blog post because I really enjoyed writing it.
9255	"The things that true gods do and don't do in the Bible are good topics to discuss." ##### "This information is bad information, irrelevant and misleading." This is junk science. Heresy. Do not believe! CHRIS PETERSEN Update: PLEASE DO NOT WATCH, READ OR LISTEN TO THIS VIDEO. This person is evil and hypocritical for suggesting that it might be reasonable to question the establishment of the creeds that these religious leaders want to impose upon their people. Pate's and Deleie's comment about "the things that true gods do and don't do" is so complete and total rubbish that I feel compelled to defend the priests of sainthood for having focused their lives on peddling fear. If your're unable to reason with some logic and sense of humility and decency, then I have no business on my spiritual journeys with you. Add your opinion in the comments below.
9256	False idols? are we sure they are false idols? What might be the best name for this: False gods are the equivalent of false idols: god-born heroes, shepherd-gods, tree gods, images of past flesh beings, the cosmos created as likeness of human beings. True gods are transcendent entities who exist beyond the mind. False gods are not true gods  True gods are transcendent entities who exist beyond the mind, False gods are not true gods
9257	If he has not made himself known we can conclude that he did not want to. In this situation it seems that the jealous god is as bad a god as the one who never made himself known. When what we worship is a god who is not able to tell us what's wrong (at the time), well, it might just be evidence that he is not really there to tell us, he doesn't really exist (this assumes that the "false gods" didn't end up becoming an actual thing, in which case we know that a "true" god never made himself known, but who could say?)
9258	There are a great many people in the world who have been misled by their religions. None of the ancient Egyptians or other ancient peoples really knew what they believed about their gods. Each religion tells the world that it is the word of the creator of the universe.  perpetual justice: The same gift be given to each and every person in the world, regardless of what their chosen religion may be.
9259	almost every other religion is misleading, makes false promises, and so forth, it would be foolish for anyone to believe in any of them as true! True gods who always told the truth must have gotten tired of hearing themselves talk about how great and perfect they were. False idols did not allow people to answer these questions! False religious institutions fail to provide the answers to these questions in a coherent way, so if you read a pamphlet on Christianity, there are going to be words, phrases, actions, ideas, visual representations, and so forth, that contradict what you learned at the bottom of that pamphlet. The not so false Christian religious institutions are sometimes not coherent, and certainly not perfect, don't fall prey to the same bigoted minds that they say they are trying to resist. False idols did not allow people to answer these questions

9264	 the cause to all problems is too much talking about the issues and not talking about the solutions problem because too much miscommunication hence have to fix that part. from not wrong and missing info. so not understand the other people is another concept and its not just stumbling on people unwisely with a gun (What an  asshole) This argument makes very little sense.

Personally, I
9281	 if someone is 17 with only a rudimentary education and can barely use their brain, sex with them is just plain wrong, but after he is 20 an STD might make it impossible for him to have a family of his own, and for his morals he's been lucky if he had only broken the law. then I respect the fact that they put together that sentence and that it might be useful. Please refrain from using it as a reason for getting young people off the sex bus.
9282	 Most people don't think what I'm doing is right. They think sex can only be comfortable when you know what it is and that sex, as it is considered nowadays is more often than not nothing but pleasure. You do know what it is? - James Carnegie No.17.

9283	You should be concerned about developing a loving relationship with one because if this person is not going to be your mate, he or she does not deserve to be in your life because you will not be able to be faithful to each other. I never got the sense that the professor said the assumption was that the man in question was about to have sex with the student. It sounds like she was referencing unprotected sex before a relationship was developed. What she said was "I once read a book from a guy who sexed up to 15 times in a night. That was against everyone's advice, thinking he was a protector, and the consequences were dire, he took his own life after having unprotected sex.

9295	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program. Londons Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep. And in the end, Banksy has made what was once a boring ugly wall something interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should respect this
9296	Without being a celebrity, he has obviously created a piece that is poignant and engagement, would the council recognise him as being a gift and not a bully? Yes Londons Westimister Council should embrace this as a gift rather than erasing a Banksy piece And they're it? No

9298	 The British government should stop taking pictures and data of British people because that is something that they have the right to do.  Take away every single picture and video that they ever gathered of British people. Smash all cameras. Threaten people with them. Steal pictures.

9301	 You are buying a gift today, not birthdays, and God knows to give gifts as you order: we have everything right out on our shelves. In the spirit of the season, remember that the Christmas spirit should center on the spirit of giving gifts for Jesus Christ‚Äôs birth. <br /><br /> Santa Clause appears on package inserts, dvd's, and gift bags. This seems like the worse possible definition of Christmas to many children of today

The following meditation suggests ways to reconnect with the true meaning of Christmas. Meditation: The true meaning of Christmas is the birth of Jesus Christ
9303	 Teachers expect children to respect holiday symbols like the birth of Jesus, as well as Santa, while at the same time students look on those holidays as a way to buy gifts and are much more attracted to such things as gifts more than Christmas. Just as children should consider Santa to be a symbol for Christmas, they should also be able to think of Jesus and the reason for the holiday of Christmas as the root of the meaning of the holiday. Instead of recieving presents to put on their christmas tree, children should give presents to someone they care about and that may make them thankful and loved
9304	 this is like a persons birthday party,everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy/girl so it is clearly not right,that is the same thing that is happening in status quo the meaning for christmas is supposed to be the birth of Jesus Christ and when Santa Clause is moved into the picture children and even now adults see Santa Clause as the Christmas symbol and it is no longer seen as Jesus.
9305	One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they do harm the body. it is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models too many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they haveboobs?

9308	The following is the argument that you have been asked to rewrite: Legalizing performance enhancing drugs will not help the health of players. It will only encourage kids to use these drugs. performance enhancing drugs to be legalized is a complete failure of society. It will only encourage kids to use these drugs, whether or not they want to use them. Taking this first step will only set the stage for more and more of the nations children to take the illegal drugs that cause severe effects on the body.

9337	I would consider ending my life, if possible. Thought of the possibility only a short time ago and dismissed as basically unfeasible, and that is why I've always contended that, at the very least, having access to what ever would eventually lead to that possibility was important for me.
9338	If I were to lose the ability to think, and my view of the world changed from black and white to all grey areas, I probably would consider ending my life. I don't want to live my life in a fog without a specific outlook or significant benefit, such as improvement.

9340	Teachers should not be paid based on years in school, not on benefits, bad teachers shouldn't be fired, directors, principals, principals and other staff should be fired for putting up teachers who couldn't put up a finger to their responsibilities. so they may not even earn as much as average.

9343	 salary teachers are paid benefit benefits for teachers test performance , not the amount of years they stayed at the school salary teachers are paid benefit benefits for teachers test performance , not the amount of years they stayed at the school teacher salary should not include the large numbers of benefits teachers are paid. this argument is more transparent to your readers and also less biased. The average salary of an american is 32,000$ the average salary of a teacher (not including the monetary value of benefits) is 53,000$ In wisconsin, the salary including benefits is 75,000$ 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits. I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire. Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school. I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman', because it sheds light on the many imperfections of our failing public school system. The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, the US has some of the lowest scores.

9347	Regardless of how much we wish this theory to be true, it is wrong. No matter how much we have been impressed by these theories, there are a myriad of reasons why they are otherwise completely and demonstrably wrong.

9350	Yes. The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous water cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Yes. It doesn't make much sense. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area?

9355	Thays always expresses himself in such a heated way. I respect that he cares enough about the country as an American and patriot of other countries to talk about this kind of subject. Despite all the negativity it is possible that we may not fight Iran. However, it is not unexpected. The neoconservatives may not realize what they are doing with their predictions. Israel may fight the U.S. over Iran. We do not have war with Iran yet. The neoconservatives are planting the seeds to cause a war.
9356	 Why do people hate the West ? They hate our rule so  a devastating attack may occur in a very short amount of time and the post awar situation could be devastating. So people would like to see these destructive activities stop.  We must take precautions so this does not happen. People are the ones that hate the west. If there were a short war and no major disaster, most of them would gladly return to a peaceful and happier social situation. But they would also be the ones who will decide on the situation of this country.
9357	Find yourself some side and stop lying to yourself for the sake of human rights (at least by rallying all things against U.S. - you're not helping, but you are helping the terrorists)...... Taking a stand just to rid yourself of a cancer is wrong. Would you rather wait for it to become larger? Playing the victim is insincere and makes you sound weak. If people find Iran's naivety concerning the U.S. and its plans for the world, they might stop being stupid. So educate people about where Iran is really going.  [Comment 1 was added after sending this e-mail message]
9358	There is no disagree side but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation.

9395	According to me, school uniform is efficient because it shows a difference between the rich and the poor. At the same time, I think that teenagers are aware of school uniform. After their graduation, they might not be careful with their uniforms. School uniform is expensive but it‚Äôs expensive, I think.
9396	 You should wear school uniform to school if you meet the following requirements: you cannot afford plain clothes, and you do not want to feel inferior and have a sense of belonging, you do not want to feel inferior and have a sense of belonging. and you want to wear to school with clothes so you have a sense of belonging
9397	And I have to wear school uniform all the time. student life. The student must be responsible for his actions and needs. However, if he has a problem with school uniform then he must mention it to his teacher or principal.  Conclusion: Students will have to support school uniform by wearing it in school and when they go to college.
9398	There are many benefits of the school uniform. It is efficient and an inspiration for the students to be fashionable. There is a gap between the rich and poor, however, the school uniform is an advantage in different ways for different groups of students. Try to produce a decent template and write the code. def school_uniform(text):
9399	They say school uniform is inconvenient but they didn't have to think about their clothes during their student days because the clothes were free. that some students in low-income families felt inferior when they could not afford brand-name and quantity-driven personal style clothing, or when they attended schools with a uniform.  On the other hand, researchers tend to support the notion that uniforms create identity groups, allowing students to more easily belong.
9400	A school is a group or organization that often has rules and uniforms. The families under these schools then attempt to live up to the rules and conform to the expectations set by these schools as well.
9401	 Students may not wear signs that are woven into the fabric of their uniform. Such signs may include political ideology, religious beliefs, or any other signals to the uniformed group that does not match what the state, father, or mother intends to portray within the collective community.

9410	I am not so sure about uniforms. I don't think that is a good idea
9411	I will buy my own school uniform and just do the research on how much it costs and who makes the clothes wears more than not
9412	School uniforms suck because you have to wear them for so long and they get dirty
9413	 No school uniforms for me! It is a good idea to wear a t-shirt and jeans all the time.
9414	Dad: I think it's a good idea Dad: This argument is much better as the only person who works and gets paid for cleaning up is the guy who sold the uniform and he had to wear the uniform to try to sell it

9420	With all this new functionality, anyone can fall in love with Firefox. But if you are looking for an easy browsing experience, with minimal/no add-ons (especially the dark version), you can get similar navigating experience at other browsers. You may prefer to keep Firefox as the centerpiece of your browser arsenal.
9421	Would you recommend Firefox? Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox. Yes, I would recommend Firefox Yes, I would recommend Firefox
9422	I can reconfigure Firefox easily and quickly to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need great SEO extensions, I can easily get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead of something else, FF can be easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs. The breadth and variety of FF's add-ons is a critical advantage.
9423	Chrome is good for responsiveness and security. Firefox is great for themes, enhancements, themes and add-ons. Both are excellent browsers for use on the web.
9424	If I have a team of IT experts who can quickly and easily reconfigure my Firefox very quickly to meet my needs, my HR team can be less involved. This restructuring allows me to increase my agility and the agility of my company.
9425	Firefox is an efficient website browser with lots of capabilities and it has lots of people playing in its community
9426	KDE has the user-based core which has been built upon several other open source
9427	Chrome has the latest and greatest security measures therefore it wins
9428	Firefox is the easiest, most universally installed free browser  ### Output: Firefox is the simplest, most

9430	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. I would prefer not to know. That's no surprise. Very amused by this answer. No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways.
9431	 No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me that I had knowledge of it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.  ### Output:
9432	 Yes, I would turn my spouse in. I would be like. You should have left it alone, and we'll go separate ways. But I wouldn't want to know.
9433	 No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.   None
9434	 No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in, because I would just make things worse. Maybe they see a glimpse of the truth, and they can see it has changed them. They can start to see that I'm better and I'm the one who committed the mistake. I don't want them to think I'm awful.
9435	 No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
9436	 No I wouldn't tell on him because he saved my life...I would trust him with everything and he would never let me down....plus he saved my secret.....he has my trust and I wouldn't let him down for anything
9437	 No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
9438	 I don't know where this story comes from but this guy is a total sketchy f****** git... No more words are needed from us to communicate with him... beware.....
9439	 Yes he should get whatever he deserves because if he is truly guilty then it should be to the full extent and nobody should go unpunished for causing that person harm, sadness and they should be held responsible....
9440	I should talk to the police and tell them to find someone else and to punish that person but I would want my husband to be treated with respect and compassion and no humiliation because it hurts me too much to see him treated like that
9441	 If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison
9442	 Consider what would happen to your mother if he had committed a murder if you had continued to live with him and he was in jail awaiting execution. You would of course feel torn. In other words, you would be torn between the love you had for him and hatred towards him for murdering someone you did not do it. How would you feel if you had a violent, abusive husband who scared the life out of you but you was also in love with him and wanted to stay together? I am not sure, but I am certain I wouldn't turn him in and certainly not that fast. I would think about my future feelings and face to

9447	No. When someone you love commits a crime, then you should confront them and have them help solve the crime. You can get caught if you do that, but you will get the justice you are seeking. Tell them what you think about the murder, and ask them if they were guilty. In my opinion, for a person you love and care for, you would seek help from them and try to let them get the help that they need.   ### Comment: It's not possible to answer this question perfectly.

9449	No, I would not turn someone in to authorities for murder. Really, you wouldn't make a decision like that. Of course it's illegal to commit murder and I'd never do that. More to the point, the consequence is incredibly serious. Be very cautious if faced with this situation.

9465	 The same father figure in both situations is a better option then having two father figures. If you had one great father figure then one lousy one you would lose no power from the good one. To limit the impact of the bad father figure it is better to have only one father.
9466	 father is far more important to a child then number of steps between you and he because who you love is the most important thing in all things. From the parent child relationship a child learns to be responsible to succeed to live a good life despite what life presents to him.

Re-writing:   ### Input:  I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have

9471	 There is always something for a father to do and fatherlessness is no way to go. It would be better to have a father who knows their duty rather than someone who behaves better on the street but can't get their life together at home. I would be glad if my dad was a better guy than where he's at now. It would be better to have a father who knows his duty rather than someone who behaves better on the street but can't get his life together at home.
9472	 My first feedback is that before reading this I had no idea that we can really be fatherless. I dont really believe I would wish to be fatherless but I would think it would be better to have a lousy father then not. Then I would think the same as them.

9482	 Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, because he was having political problems and fearing them.   ### Response:  Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
9483	Farquhar was sacked for the best interests of the Singapore population at heart. That's what Raffles does. It's very correct. Farquhar was indirectly harming the population.
9484	 Given the circumstances, it would have been unwise for Farquhar to have started adopting measures that required the population to fight, sword in hand, a government that was beginning to fight against him.

9522	It's alright if you change one word in this question to make the question more suitable. Farquhar was popular because of his generosity.
9523	 Farquhar once opposed taxes. The protesters cried out loud against the taxes. When the protesters were boisterous and raised their voices, Farquhar had to be present. That way, the officials could clearly hear the people.

LGBT people should stick with the gay community. They will be more comfortable and in a healthier environment.
9634	Yes, there will always be straight people because the population changes over time. And even if straight people were to become extinct at some point in the future, so would other people who could reproduce. So they could produce offspring. Therefore, you can't call homosexual marriage ethical because it would be unethical.  # Use this code

9645	Christianity conflicts with scientific evidence and denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings are full of contradictions. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two. Few people favor it.
9646	Facts contrary to the doctrines and practices of Christianity are called pseudoscience. Christian pseudoscience is disputed by many, including many scientists. Scientific explanations of many of the claims of Christian pseudoscience contradict the teachings of Christianity. The physical evidence for these pseudo-science are dubious at best. Then, Christianity would be slandered if all scientific evidence was considered.
9647	Arguments for Christianity are full of contradictions, and they just don't hold ground. Atheism is the better position. End of response. Most other atheistic religions do not base their beliefs on Bible verses nor follow the bible commandments. End of response.
9648	Christianity is irrational and silly, thus in need of denying. Christianity is wrong on every level.  What is Christian? a religion that believes Jesus of Nazareth was divine and personified Messiah, Son of God the Son.
9649	Christianity is different from natural science because it does not use science. It treats the evidence, nothing else. Christianity is wrong because it denies rational & impartial common sense. Christianity wrong because it contradicts the facts, according to science. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the better position.
9650	Awesome, math does NOT have all the answers but that's just what makes it so cool. Imagine turning reality into codes and equations while blaming it on your imagination.

9653	If we knew we had all the answers we wouldn't seek them ever, right? That's the difference between Religion and Science, Science admits it's NOT perfect, while Religion is SO dogmatic they pretend it's perfect. And even what LOVE really stands for.
9654	 No one ever said religion is perfect, religion is what many people believe to be right without any reason and God just listen to their actions
9655	But at least Jesus Christ's lies are based on historical truths. Yes, Jesus Christ's lies are based on historical truths, but alas, we have now replaced his prognostications (what he predicted to happen to this or that person or event) with a lie. Now we can "fix" his lies with another lie and pretend that they are true.
9656	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser.
9657	 Cowardice. Unfortunately, you could find that all religions (even the truth-based religions) are afraid of being the perpetrator of violence and losing their supporters. In other words, they act like cowards.
9658	I am sure no god who could fill the void of whatever they talked about, lied constantly about that which they said. I am absolutely satisfied that I could better represent the needs of mankind.
9659	You can replace God with someone who has lied over many centuries, and we now knowingly elect more leaders who lie. They also don't seem to be doing anything about it. The third thing that makes this situation even worse is the fact that, when you look at the good things that these pastors, apostles, religious leaders, false Christs, or any given deity has done, it has done nothing good, yet we worship them as messiahs and still call them lord.  The last thing that makes a god unreasonable is the fact that we can, and do just that

9661	 Beef scalding: They allow you to place hot water over a burned piece of meat until the blood and juices evaporate.
9662	When someone is spanked they probably don't do the same thing twice. Also it's normal to punish children a lot to avoid the same mistake over and over again.
9663	Well, how did I know that my kids did the same thing over and over and over again? because there is nothing to make them do. They do what you tell them to do.
9664	1: You shouldn't be like this because it makes the children feel sad.  ### Response 2: I don't know you. My kids wouldn't want to be treated like that.  Answer 2
9665	 Yes before we might never have got to this point  Yes
9666	No but not because that way the child can learn not to do it because it really hurts.  Yes

9668	Yes i understand that they don't like the garlic
9669	No hard feelings, but I had a son. Yes
9670	 Yes I think you should spank a child only when he makes the same mistake again because scared children tend to be more open to being spanked.
9671	No In my opinion, when a child act rudely, it would be better to talk to him about his rude behavior first instead of spanking him.
9672	 Yes I believe you should spank a child only when he is wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9673	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.

9675	 The field of medicine specializes in healing those with an illness. The goal is to save that person from death. When someone needs medicine for illness, that means they may have faith in a physician.
9676	 Christianity isn't important in their daily life because they don't practice it. Part of what makes them different is that they spend so much time worshipping but do nothing that makes them better people, like working hard to study for school, spending time helping others, or doing something good in the community for which they live. Christianity doesn't equal worshipping Jesus, not anymore. Christianity equals worshipping Jesus with doing something
9677	It was to change faith to consider the possibility of changing their religious beliefs.< br> Interpretation: Faith = Considering the possibility of changing religious beliefs
9678	Donations are turned into funds for UNJ agencies (United Nations NonGovernmental agencies). The group works to provide humanitarian aid in times of natural and man-made disasters.

9695	I probably don't like it. I think it is unnecessary to spank. However, I could be against punishing a child for being naughty.
9696	 You smelled something really awful.  You shouldn't have cooked it in the microwave.
9697	I think that the punishment should be consistent and never short of the reason of it.
9698	I still think it's okay to spank, but not if the parents are annoyed about it, if the punishment is physically disproportionate with the crime, and if the kid that receives the punishment is under 8.
9699	I think that spanking is not very useful and should be banned from our society, but it should not be punished too severely.

9708	 No, you shouldn't be spanked and i think you can spank them but as you grow up you shouldn't because if you do they won't respect you because then the relationship won't grow.
9709	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.

9716	 I do not agree that parents say I am a bad person and I am a good person because is not working because now my children do not like their parents and they do not like themselves
9717	We need to teach our children how to handle themselves when faced with other people different from them and while dealing with their problems and start on that as soon as possible and not to be scared
9718	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens

9721	no I wouldn't turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
9722	 Since the circumstances are multiple and varied we will not redefine the response, but we will create an understandable story instead. I had once been working and the boss came to me and told me my wife wanted me to call the police so I can look after my interest and when my wife heard that she really didn't like me that much and I said yes because I was afraid of what would happen to me after that. After the boss called me and I went there to make sure nothing was wrong with my wife, then she left but a few hours later she really was murdered. Therefore I went to the police to solve the murder. Yes
9723	 Yes I would turn them in I think maybe a few they would be under the influence. They could be turned in only if they killed a person for money or under the influence of some alcohol or drugs.

9725	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.

9727	No spouse. If you want to be a hero make sure you are not married. It would be hard to turn them in. I would think it would cause more problems than they would benefit. Heroes do not marry.
9728	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. My spouse killed her ex-boyfriend and that made me see what she is capable of. Maybe she was just trying to be out of control. Maybe she is just sick in the head. I decided that it is the best thing to do.
9729	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. What you need to realize is that if they did this once, it could happen again. What you must do is think about your own safety and your family's safety. You need to turn your spouse in for it to be safe, so you can't really avoid it.  ### Output: Yes, I would turn my spouse in. There is no reason for me to keep quiet, so I would turn my spouse in.

However, you do have some rights that can allow you to reach a compromise. Keep these things in mind before you contact a landlord and hear their story. After you have seen the repairs, and the landlord seems to be willing to work with you, try to talk to the landlord.

9788	 Since the situation has changed, let me show how I have been thinking about it to find a solution to this problem. But you should consider another solution. Before finding a new landlord, here are the possibilities:   i. Talk with your landlord. If you feel that they are really willing to solve the problem, you can start a conversation. Explain the problem to your landlord and ask him if they are willing to provide another renter while the property is fixed. It can be a temporary solution. ii. Consider talking with a prospective landlord to see if you can come up with a temporary solution. iii. Develop other solutions. i

9798	Yes, you can call them up and tell them how unhappy you are and ask that the designs be redone -- if they're not, you should. You could just give them a phone call and ask. After all, contracts are there for that purpose. Anything below is legitimate if you used this as a means.

9817	Yes,I agree.I just can't see them taking the high road and some condemnation of their actions would be appropriate. it's difficult.Saddam Hussein supporters would look at you as their conscience.

9820	 18.5% of the total population might be considered too young to drink. Make another change so that it be more meaningful if possible. I think that's a lot. Forcing even the most risk averse of 18-year-olds to wait out their drinking session so that they will not die will have the same effects on their health as drinking alcohol.   ### Response:   I am not sure where this comes from but when I read about the statistics around alcohol consumption, alcohol is most likely to kill people when they are young and healthy. Preventing someone from drinking before they die because they might die is a horrible idea because it goes against their natural growth. The
9821	 I do not agree with the idea of an 18 age limit. 18 year olds are the most fun age to have a drink. 18 is the tipping point when you cannot properly drive a motorcycle. This is why 18 is the perfect age to have a drink
9822	 I think the above argument is confused and in need of a rewrite. A 19 year old shouldn't drink any alcohol. In 18 and 19 year olds (as in "regardless" or "not counting...") This question is trivial.

9825	Yes. not enough information to write a comment Create a car parking space. Not very persuasive. Maybe give them their own program and web site with real information about the office of special services. The child abuse victims deserve a web site or link to a website, not a hard porn site. There are some decent websites, not just porn. Not many resources, however.
9826	No, you're not going to get a good answer from their part at all. The professionals working with your son are obviously very highly trained in this work (which they probably get real good pay for at a lot of expense). You, and your son, are as good as you can be with the restrictions the DVF gives you.   Again, you don't need to send a letter to them, it's a formality. And they have essentially "terminated" in their regard. More or less.
9827	Yes. I agree. Anyways the standard UK rule is that CPS can't move a child back into the family for reasons other than abuse - I guess there are exceptions... The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more damage than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
9828	 Yes. It is a dreadful situation. I have a similar one in my home state. And i have no idea how to combat it without passing on to the next generation. At times I don't know if I can handle it. As a single mother raising a teen male I find myself torn between I want it all for my baby son to be safe and happy, and I also need to survive day by day on this earth.
9829	No i want to return my son and still raise him. I want to be with my son and raise him. I'm not built for the world, not made for the stresses. When people ask why i live alone, i respond "your son lives with me." And they look at me and wonder, "Well, why don't you get married?" ***

9834	Authoritative court decisions date back to the dawn of time in almost all cultures and laws, as mankind has always sought a way to solve problems or enforce rules. State laws or rules of a certain culture determine a person's behavior or events affecting him or her. For example in the United States, rape is punishable by law if the perpetrator is a victim's spouse, blood relative, father, stepfather, older brother, and under 15 years old.
9835	Many of the answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the babies choice? Yes baby would decide and that the answer they should get is "I"I love having sex with a child to make you feel a certain way
9836	The obvious answer is not a good one. Understand what they want in case they end up choosing this - they want to be able to choose to go through with it and when they make the decision and then it is over. Adjust as: No one would want to be undignified, would they? the women would want the doctor who operates to do his best not make them uncomfortable nor pain them; it is the doctor's responsibility to think of what is most probable and least painful for them instead of what is hardest for him to make a profit from.

Yes Yes This argument is against abortion and links to the health of the mother. This seems out of proportion and unfair.  Instead of critiquing her for apparently heading off to the Vatican, why don't we try helping her bring more up to date? But I'm at least trying my best with this response
9840	No, you could  be sent to jail for possessing a cell phone in court, or as seen, take you to jail if it does not go the proper way.  It really depends on the judge's stance on the issue.  You can submit a motion to have it withheld, but you may need some outside help to  that effect. Sorry. If you want, you can take your phone off when you enter the court house and send the remark.  I personally have never seen someone on a jury be asked to display their cell phone. I thought this question was about jury selection. You may have to think this through at home a bit better.

If you take pictures of your neighbor without her consent then you could be accused of extortion, battery or even assault or rape (depending on state laws). Now, this really depends on the judge, the laws and the courtroom.   I'd suggest talking to your barrister about this next. No
9845	The real estate agent should be unaware of the plans. In fact, he should not even know about them. He can only check the type of land if he actually does commissions. It would be wise for the client to point out the importance of proper foundations. It is up to the agent to do the checking for footings or to come up with something else. The estate agent should point out the importance of performing a thorough inspection of the property and that there are no legal implications if such checks are not carried out. It would be wise for the client to put the estate agent in the picture as well.

9853	We don't truly know why certain forms of self-harm are more and more common.  Perhaps we should look at real-world examples of why people self-harm and work on creating solutions rather than focusing on actions most can control.  Perhaps one day we will even be able to have personalized robots help people who self-harm in the more severe situations that present themselves. There are a million reasons for people to not comply with the laws, and it doesn't appear that we are focused on trying to change that.  I think, in some way, we're simply focused on limiting what government has the ability to do to us.  Perhaps, if we focus on solutions, more people will begin to comply rather than just complaining about things.

9855	 Instead of trying to export other people's opinions onto our soil and try to force an Islamistic country to follow along with our laws on what the rule of law is, we should increase dialogue and debate on those very subjects while at the same time, improving our legislation and generally engaging in a fruitful form of diplomacy. American spiritual solace is contingent on the critical role of secular humanism and also of America's security and well-being.
9856	 Islam is just as absurd as tribalism and fundamentalism.  We need to make Islam separate from the religion we want to see in the world and that is civilised European western civilization.

Some of the people who attended the protest have had feelings of a sense of betrayal at Google and wanted to take their business elsewhere.

9865	Not knowing why you and your daughters father are not together my advice can only be very generalized.

9890	Discrimination and segregation against racial minorities is still a problem today. Such problems can be very divisive and difficult to deal with and often ignore what the law and what others feel the need to improve upon. The result of segregation is racial inequality. in ten normal schools as public officials and academics. They had two opinions: one that Brow v. Board was great while the other opinion held that the system was not separate but unequal.
9891	I think it's really a good system, now if only we didn't have for-profit education. I think the letter of the law was the wrong place for this law. I think Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but separate".
9892	 Equal and seperate should not be the sole definition of the word of the law and the spirit of the law. Furthermore, they cannot be defined the same way without making a manichean view of social issues. Schools are not only important in economic terms but also important in social and environmental terms. The financial and geographic restrictions of the poor may help explain the less structured way they respond to change.  ### Preamble: A person can subscribe to all the philosophies of life. That doesn't make them right.
9893	 Ban the segregation between residential and school neighborhoods, which prevents someone from sending their kids to a school near where they live. Favor neighborhood schools in the center of the city, so children can attend the nearest school in less than 20 minutes. Favor integration. Balance between neighborhood and urban schools. Favor programs to improve literacy. Fix the townships. Ensure neighborhood schools are good quality.
9894	In my opinion, the Court's historic decision of Brown v. Board was meant to bridge a legal gap into creating an equal education system for white children, both in technical schools and within classrooms. However, there are still many racial minorities who are struggling to find equal opportunities in today's classrooms. Many of them are born into wealthier families, have high levels of education, and thus would benefit greatly, if not completely, from the federal programs that are run through K-12. So, while still unequal, there is less of a gap now than when Brown v. Board was decided.
9895	Don't tell them that you weren't actually summoned or excused twice. Because they are wrong. Tell them all the good reason you didn't attend. Let them know that you were merely excused twice because you had to go home to deal with medical issues and missed two lectures.

His prospective employer probably has rules on reschedules.   Important to mention   reasons for being out of town/away, and to convey that you plan on returning before the end of your leave/ absence.   Perhaps understand not to over stress though.
9898	I apologize! This simply isn't my thing. I'll find someone else to do this for me. If you don't mind, I'd like to do it myself. It wasn't an accident.
9899	Tell them they will not be satisfied in talking to anybody if they have issues. They will use their authority to kick you off campus forever if they want to.  You may want to meet with a counselor or college counselor if this occurs.
9900	Yes, in New York, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated firearms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a hand gun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest!
9901	Yes, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase.

9902	No, violent criminals spend large amounts of time cleaning up evidence after committing an offense. Violent criminals are also responsible for the majority of harm brought upon themselves as a result of their crimes. Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase.

9903	Yes, in most other states it is one day. In some states, like Kentucky, it is only two days, some states no waiting period while others provide a 24 hour waiting period. Northern California has had waiting periods for 30 years, but they seem to not affect criminals and they still have guns out there with open carry. North Carolina is part of the south, and there is an influx of Southerner tourists to Northern California, but there is no comparison. A comparison of an FFL dealer in Northern California and a FFL dealer in Florida would be like comparing apples and oranges.
9904	No, the state could not make a rule for the entire country regarding the gun laws. Quote from the Constitution "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the free exercise of religion." If you can't afford a handgun, you will be legally denied the right to own one because the Federal Bureau of Investigation makes you carry a handgun whenever you're not shooting. (Which takes nearly two years of never having used it and then fired it.) Here is the updated code:   static boolean gunBreaksTheLaws(String states){     String[] statesArr = states.split(",");     for(int i = 0 ;i < statesArr.length ; i++){         //the first two regex functions check the states short name, so no need to include the third part here         String regex = "(\\d{1,3}),?\\s*(\\d{3}),?\\s*(\\d{5,5})";         if(Pattern.matches(regex, statesArr[i])){             if(FileBreaksTheLaws(statesArr[i].replaceAll(",",""))){                 return true;             }         }         else{             String regexA = "(\\d{1,3}),?\\s*(\\d{3}),?\\s*(\\d{5})";             String regexB = "(\\d{1,3}),?\\
9905	Isn't an abortion legal anymore because of liberal progressive laws or the fact that some states grant to aborts their sons? What is happening in political system?  If the answer is law, as mentioned above the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the iffy criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and gauranteed.  Although the justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully in the future people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it, wait without further comment on this answer is over.
9906	By undermining the police and parole departments. Yes, this isn't too helpful, but the main problem of the "correcting system" is undermining police departments. Ten guilty people can serve longer jail terms than one innocent person, but without sufficient resources, police departments will not be able to correct anyone.  ### Pros: Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening. Not happening.
9907	The American justice system is unique because it permits 10 guilty persons to continue their lives in safety as compared to one innocent person who will return to jail. Basically, he was claiming that the justice system is not functioning properly, and a solution was in order to salvage the relationship. I probably would have answered for him in this scenario, "You probably should leave him in jail for the rest of his life." Which is probably not fair, but your list of solutions would be totally different.

Some victims were questioned again, but others were quickly released; by the end of the day, no arrests had been made, not even a notice. I don't know why, but he knew that his mom would turn up on the streets and get in trouble.
9909	CITizens of the United States must be able to trust that our justice system is efficient enough to "take care" of the people who've broken the law. People who committed this crime in Florida and not in the Middle East are innocent people, who had nothing to do with it, this was a lame attempt by terrorists to take advantage of the limited time between the 9/11 attacks, to make it look as if this was a police state. Police should be able to effectively and quickly get to the arsonists (both sides do), and not leave things to fend for themselves. On the other hand, those around 9/11 (Prosecutors, Judges, Lawyers, Journalists) should be reformed, as it was a "nice" catch all, for their own personal gain. These guys should be removed from the justice system.
9910	 We make reasonable offers that far exceed your estimated medical bills. From this day forward all compensation will be given to you in cash. Don't wait to act, your health is most important! your injury, then call an attorney immediately. Resist any attempts by the business to settle your claim by cash settlements. Never pay for your injuries from a medical bill. Call an attorney if you are struggling to pay your bills.
9911	Their response for your complaint? We are under an obligation to our insurance provider to retain an attorney as soon as your complaint is filed. Our Company does not want to handle a claims management position where the claimant has lost their case, because it could lead to potential litigation.   Your injured party can not contact the insurance provider by calling them from their office. Instead, they only respond by sending a written letter to the insured party notifying them that they received a written complaint via your insurer. If you have been injured, you can call 1-800-772-1212 or visit http://www.claimsservices.com/atall.asp?at=<patronymic>.com to file the complaint.
9912	Just tell them that you want their info and if they have an ins. provider you can talk to them about it. Consider contacting them directly if you're not able to get a state statute reference/link to allow you to work with their ins. provider to negotiate with your carrier for a lower premium rate. Ask about their recommendations if they are good and have done similar cases.
9913	 If you are concerned about significant deductions from your income or profits because of attendance at the Motocross, consider employee rest time or time off work and/or leave time, which may be available to you from your employer.   But if an incident is serious, don't ignore your problem. Stay on top of your injuries and don't ignore it. Compare other costs to the cost of just hiring an attorney - the cost of an attorney is nothing compared to the expense of misplacing your income and profits because of a negligent or careless business.
9914	Consumer products rarely cause so many problems and require damages to go to $1000. Rubbing compound/cleaning materials are not seen as consumer product. Input: STOP! before retaining an attorney $$$, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and request the name of their ins. provider. Often they make reasonable offers. (in this case doc bill plus $1000)  Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your states max. small claims award by $1000 should you even consider discussing the matter with an attorney.   Unless you were injured and treated professionally (have a bill) your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering with this type of occurance will be aprox. $1000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice.   If you hire an attorney it is likely there won't be enough money left to pay the bill for your care.
9915	Americans do not like Mexican illegals. Though I understand the majority of these people are desperate to leave the country to live a better life for their families it doesnt really make sense. America is a very open country. Could have sent you to a resort on the Caribbean within minutes if you were killed in a road accident in your country. I understand that you might want to explain what went on with you to this country but I doubt this country will care or give a rat about your stupid life and its not a country that cares about each citizen.
9916	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Even those that are here illegaly. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late. I would blame that on the media or the politicians makeing an issue of it more than anything else. ive lived in Texas all my life the illegal alien thing is nothing new.there were plenty illegals here for more more than thirty years and never heard one complaint until the last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways.

9920	No it's not a thing happening in modern society, although someone has already had a very bad idea to do so. It has happened, but not frequently. The only reason it would even become a thing would be if there was an imbalance in force. In other words, if a guy could force a bunch of girls at once to just give up what they were doing and go with him as his personal protector and security. In a serious sense, a guy would be unable to resist being "raped".

9922	 It can happen. It did and it has happened. The example is not the exclusive definition for battered women. There are women who are beaten up and continue to get sex and many sex work women who would do such to have easy sex, as there is usually no relationship. Although you would need evidence to take such a road and it is hard to prove in court. That requires a beating to take evidence of tearing clothing or bruising and testimony from witnesses.
9923	Yes, it's possible. It's also easy to happen. Since with a guy there's a lot less control than with a girl, there is a much easier chance he would contract an STD, especially from a date rape drug, and the chances of testing positive for an STD are much higher. The possibility of getting stuck with an STD makes it even harder to prove because the doctor is not inclined to find any proof.
9924	 It is a plausible story for an urban legend, but is not something that would be seen as a serious situation. It's hard to prove unwillingness to sex, and it could easily be shown that men even like to have sex with each other. Any woman at any age who says she isn't interested is obviously lying. A woman won't want to get bad sex for free.
9925	I would write the following... The narrator has a moral concern over the sex act and it is clear he would blame the pregnant woman if it caused a miscarriage, not the unmarried man who had sex with her. [...]  the girl used birth control just fine but a man had intercourse with her and that shouldn't have allowed him to get on the plane to the wedding and get married.
9926	 He is not the father. The father is... After that he is irresponsible for having a child without bringing it up. He may decide to bring it up but he is not the father. Only God can bring it up. this way to have your baby, and she gets pregnant unintentionally. He will keep the baby when she gets married, and she gets to keep the money. You know this to be true because she wants to, right?
9927	 Would he have had a case if she intentionally got pregnant and knew he had no desire to have a child? no case, but that will probably be hard to prove. That also implies that he has made more than one choice in the past that allowed him to perform sexual acts with men he didn't even know, and perhaps not even like, that in some way allowed him to become a father.
9928	 You should tell her he needs to use birth control to prevent her from getting pregnant. You need to tell him what birth control his likely to do and how to take care of himself so he won't have more children and he should try to use it when she is pregnant. You should tell her you can offer to help with the aftermath and give her medical advice. After that you can say you have a policy to not involve yourself in people else's family life and if she wants advice in the future she should contact you.
9929	Yes I agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father. This is very true. Original Answer: Yes I agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father. This is very true.\n\n Children's education should not take into account the opinion of an adult of the man who has birthed the child.

9940	  The UN's main concern is power and it is used by Guantanamo detainees and convicted members to use when incarcerated. The UN and press both may be using the humiliation detainees at Guantanamo undergo to use it on detainees. UN officials also monitor the prison. Inmates do not run fast while being taken to see a judge because they are not well yet, they are starving. They are probably being mistreated, but not tortured as US has always supposed.
9941	Guantanamo lawyers create legal texts that cite and use articles from the news to show Guantanamo was correct.  They have also cited, at least implicitly, a UN convention, thereby creating references. In addition, since force feeding can be a form of torture, they do not provide any food for the prisoners who chose to do so.

While the inmates were humiliated, they were not tortured.  The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US.""  Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.""  Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated."""
9943	  Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The issue of Guantanamo is that it does not have equivalent levels of human rights to other countries. That is why critics of the injustice in Guantanamo say it is a political prison. This was made evident when  the prisoners of war who were allowed to petition for political asylum went to Mexico and were ordered back to Guantanamo by the Mexican president.   Here, we have video footage of the ordeal they went through with their bodyguards to get the documents back.
9944	 Guantanamo Bay is a facility that used  force feeding prisoners on hunger strike who accepted forceful oral sex as a form of treatment as a form of punishment. The list of who is involved is extensive. The list of victims is even larger than victims at Guantanamo Bay.   But, none of the issues discussed are about a violation of rights or innocence.
9945	 ???   ### Expected Output:  More targeted approaches, but particularly a shift in international student admissions (that in the EU was responsible for helping Greece) and targeted worker relocation programs, could increase the tax revenues in this country. L'entr√©e des jeunes Grecs en Europe et la relocalisation des travailleurs europ√©ens en Asie ont induit une augmentation des recettes fiscales importantes.
9946	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.
9947	 Singapore versus European countries's problems are different.  ### Problem:  Singapore's luxury taxes are prohibitive to sales and high tax rate is leading more people to relocate. European countries lack the burden to cope with the increased prices for luxury cars and clothing.  But is the highest rate of tax in Dubai and Singapore really the problem? The highest rate of tax in Dubai and Singapore doesn't the highest tax rates of any other countries.
9948	Based on the facts above and the provided information we can conclude that "moving to Singapore" would likely benefit people, since it is cheaper than countries like Europe. From my research I found the financial situation of Europe and Singapore in the last decade, Europe was in deep crisis and Singapore saw an increase in its economic growth, that saw an increase in its population and it's tax rate.

9950	  Brain activity level defines a person being alive. This goes against the existing state of pregnancy because most women are pregnant in the early stages of pregnancy.

9955	To me this topic has serious consequences. suicide is a serious thing to consider and is dangerous. See a doctor as soon as possible. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the world. I think its stupid to commit suicide. people who commit suicide are sick. are poor and are extremely stupid people. I believe that suicide is foolish and people who do this are sane. if suicide is a decision you made, just make another because you want to, but see someone or see a doctor after to make sure you are okay
9956	if you are not hardcore about what you do then all you do is try on the same day. A person can clearly see suicide is not an option unless you are prepared for death to happen. What can you say, being prepare in mind to go by your own means is dangerous.
9957	suicide should be a crime and punishment of suicide should be higher than others. solve the current problems about child abuse child trafficking etc and then you can think about this topic in a better way. take your own life is stupid. not your strong point. people who commit suicide are not stupid. I think there has been a crack in the human beings who are making suicide a natural habit and a natural choice. suicide should be a crime
9958	 Dont imitate the destructive behavior of someone else. That is called suicide. lol! Suicide is stupid, so dont follow suit! It is not logical. don't think it's so good idea or that it is cool, just because other people do it. If you don't, is very simple thing to do, that you live your life for yourself
9959	Topic: suicide? I believe that if a person can suicide, they can continue living. It's stupid to do such a thing when you are willful enough to consider or even act on upon it. It really doesnt make any sense why you rather take your own life then live when you are so capable of the former. Suicide is not an option i find necessary and that a person who commit are stupid. So, topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on"

9961	 sometimes people overrate their abilities and think they are too good. too often it is the other way around, with too many people underrating their abilities and not developing properly  but also students in school should in some form be able to challenge themselves by taking classes that go higher and harder and students should not be underachieving for all the wrong reasons.
9962	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum.

There is a good reason we don't define absolute morals because there isn't one. Plus there's the fact that it really doesn't need to be defined anyway. There's even no clear-cut moral dichotomy that's determined by the total of the two. Other than that, I guess it's just kind of interesting that you believe in absolute morals.

If you don't believe in god, you have no basis to believe that something exists. And even if you do believe in god, he didn't create homosexuality.

9976	The term 'blackpeople' should be replaced with 'people of African descent'. The word 'blackpeople' has always been used to refer to people of African descent, therefore it was natural to ask whether it was problematic or not.The term 'people of African descent' does not have a negative connotation and is an accurate alternative to the traditional term 'blackpeople'

However, I am inclined to believe that the word is still one of those sweeping, unpredictable terms which have evolved into "ban". I also am inclined to believe that using the word racist, not racial slaver. Using the word hasn't been around for as long as *isms*. After we let it die, it spread from a group to the next one, its name changed and then come back and another group uses it so it's not really the same as racial slaver or another ethnicity. * It is my opinion

9983	 I often watch films in the theater and I've noticed a lot of people clapping during the end of a movie. Every now and then, a few people in the audience may come up to the stage to clap as well. For a normal theater, it makes sense.
9984	 The creative director should write a movie or video that responds to this conundrum, or choose to ignore this. Someone in the audience should stop clapping. So close friends can still clap each other while the movie is on. So the director makes a mistake.

9991	Point 2 - education changes over time and requires ever changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Step, we need a system to determine if teachers are producing the same result as the teacher. If teachers are effective and students are producing progress, we need to be sure that teachers are effective. A summary of this question is how would education reach the maximum effect? Step 1: continued learning by teachers
9992	One way in which the system could improve and is an intervention that should be considered is increased teacher pay. strong educational institutions will have higher paying jobs. In the next 10 years, high performing teachers should be paid more each year. underperforming teachers should have their job cut. increase number of teachers to prepare for modern life.

9994	  Points 5 - underperforming teachers could be removed from the labor pool. Schools could be relocated in order to work at their greatest effectiveness if teachers were able to remove from the labor pool.  They might be shifted around based on ability. In this case this would work well, but perhaps teachers would rather maintain their position.

10015	'There is nobody?': no body of authority supporting the view that the west has 'religiously justified' hiding women's body parts. I would strongly urge you to take the above view and, if you cannot say it openly, be more adamant in your long-held belief that the current system of obscuring the rights of women and their bodies is grossly hypocritical and responsible for creating too many women who are discriminated against in the workplace, by the media, and in society in general.    Strictly speaking, there is no bodily aspect of the real-world Muslims of the world where the veil is worn as fashion. In most countries, women are freely allowed to remove their veil in public.
10016	  The point is not what I wear but what you people wear! Burqas should have the same freedom to be worn as any other kind of clothing. I am not trying to "criticize" people who wear a particular dress. If I were to wear a particular dress I wouldn't be criticised. All I am saying is that our system is different than theirs. Breasts are the part of the body that stand out to most women and as such should be allowed to be public. Our society at large should recognize this simply as the difference between men's and women's bodies.
10017	  Maia MorgensternFreedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom to cover your own body. What is not freedom is the censoring of your views by the West. Breasts are beautiful. Good. Wouldn't you rather be able to show them in public? Breasts are sexual. That makes them attractive. Breasts give women power. Do you want your power taken away by others? My view is that Muslims should be allowed to wear burqas in public as long as that doesn't add up to a threat to my personal security.
10018	 It is precisely in their refusal to acknowledge that the West practices such a thing. Nor does it stop them from censoring said images; about 5% of US internet users claim to be Muslim.

N*****s and Redskin are not near as offensive as some people make them out to be. Some people seem to think that mixing a N****s with an N****s is the same as saying that you are a N*****s. No, it is not, that is stupid. Too bad all the intellectuals are full of this stupidity.  I assume that 'Washington Redskins' as a name of team does not have any racial or ethnic connotations.

I think a tighter organization of those which oversee the sport, as well as more education, would help make the soccer game fairer for everyone.
10033	I've always thought that players should just come forward when a real injury occurs to receive medical attention and should not risk being on the same pitch as the person and potentially being trampled on by someone else. I probably wouldn't have taken part in football if I had known the severity of the injuries the players go through. It seems as if they could barely survive the blood loss caused by the contusion or fracture that caused their injury.   The poor condition of many people who rely on the sport as a means of transport seems to be part of the tragedy. If players really care about soccer, they should consider a decrease in their egos, which may also decrease some of the injuries. From one place to another, my response stays the same
10034	 Professional players goof up after small bumps; that's perfectly okay. While one player should be punished for a foul, if there's no foul from the other team or if the other player didn't know about the bump, that player should take a penalty kick. If they do, that's acceptable. My opinion. Change my view.***  History   Original:  ###Original: I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game.  ###Queried:  What do you think about professional soccer players constantly seeking to avoid punishment for their nosebleeds, tears, fouls, or bad tackles? I'd rather see a criminal
10035	Women asking to be raped is not what I have been dealing with. C.M.V.: I am not saying that everyone dressed up that way is sexually objectified, but there is always a chance of that happening if you dress an immodest way. That is the main reason I am writing the following reply to this post. Yes, that is why I am writing the following reply to this post because that is what happened to me today. Well, people think that it is alright to send sexualised emails to your fiance, but I wouldn't send a man just pictures from a party and ask to sleep with him at that same party. So, why do we send photos of dead bodies to our fiances? The thing about sending emails and asking sexual favors, is we don't want others to think that we are sexually objectified.  We are good at pretending otherwise, but in reality if we were to really put into action these principles, we would not be people to keep sending intimate or sexualised emails or asking favors. None of that matters as the groom is taken with your looks and that is the only thing that matters. The only thing that's wrong with people is that they go overboard with what clothes to wear to catch someone's eye. The rest is really all about women dressing like this to have sex with men. I am not going to say it's typical for guys or that that's what people do with their ladies. Just remember that everything I've said is just my personal opinion. If you
10036	Yes. To decrease chances of being raped. if you dress in a slightly more conservative fashion, decrease chances of being raped, even if you dress only 'nicely.' should respect them no matter what. So more like I respect men because I respect you, rather than you respect me in a sexist fashion. I have felt this way for so long and I could not decide if to dress 'smarter' or 'so as not to be seen.' Now I know that instead of making men's perceptions of me a part of myself. while I'm raising my little girls, even men feel pressured and they feel I am exploiting that sexist notion.
10037	5 minutes to sex‚Ä¶ 20 minutes to rape: How to be safer at parties, the shades and having fun? Then freaky punks might want to take advantage. Learn how to be safe. Liked the facebook's links. Definitely worth a read. They were very enlightening. Thanks. It addresses things that I've been thinking in the past. Thanks. We have been the sex object in our society since puberty. How to dress and talk to boys. Hope that helps. Perhaps with the comments below I will get a better idea of what is useful for me.
10038	To set the records straight: I, too, respect women too much. I actually liked every one of you's responses. I was too much of an emo hippy to be honest. üôÇ Believe me, however, women do not say what people think they say. Unfortunately, most men don't really put a lot of thought into these words. Stick with a straight jacket until you get the hang of writing. Here are some more points about my talk: 1. I am no expert. I am just an insecure guy and have been raped. These are the reasons I expressed what I felt and why. Enough said. Hopefully, all of you read that posting! P.S. Thanks to you guys and I'm going to change my opinion on these things.
10039	Slightly longer but much better. I still think I'm right. Women are sex objects. It's wrong to put yourself into a situation where you can be raped or get attacked in any other way. Obviously I do believe women should dress more conservatively, but again they are already in a situation where they can be attacked by people who are after their money, i.e. rapists. She used the 'if you dress like a whore...' as a reason to defend why men rape women. Good job Nick!
10040	 To be able to think about the perceptions of evil or bad people and to be more informed, I would suggest that people like Mr. Trump may have different opinions about actions or inactions of situations, but they may not have an ulterior motives.  Thanks Thanks to the media and schools for teaching the wrong perceptions of people. and people like Mr Trump
10041	The main idea of my response is I think that the bush administration is making it a whole lot worse for a number of good people. It appears that they just want to attack social justice and diminish the wages of American workers.  Write a response with less rambling and explanations. The Bush administration is trying to normalize evil and make it ok to kill Americans
10042	Negative problem solving: As mentioned above, I believe some of the men who oppose capitalism and western ideas have ulterior motives, or just think their actions are the only actions they can do to effect change. Evil doesn't mean people are good. Evil means that the source of actions will always exist and will then put these actions into an action chain. Evil has consequences, when evil is necessary to create change, yes evil needs to happen.
10043	The three that I mentioned are examples of people that may seem evil on the surface, but not actually evil. The media and schools, or just generally society, tend to confuse evil. This article for students is only focused on the third concept, that the three people were actually bad, not evil. Pedagogy: Is not specifically taught here and there is a good amount of information about this topic in Wikipedia.
10044	 While I haven't discussed, I know that these people don't think that they are evil and I would simply like to say that we are in different waves of ideas and ways that the perception of evil or good on what we do to others can just fluctuate over time. I read the media and hear about how we are supposed to judge people based off of current events and information of actions on past crime cases. Sometimes there is a little bit of bias that may come from these media and the media makes a malicious campaign or influences us on how we judge someone or what should be the "correct" actions of someone on their actions. It may simply be a misguided perception of how we judge someone and it may fluctuate over time. I don't think these people want to be evil and perhaps hate what they are doing, but it may be their belief system, which is different from everyone else's (Reagan being one of them, and some of the other American's). The media make us think that the person is evil. So we should stand firm

Remove gravity from schools or at least include in science class other notions to explain the phenomena we speculatively call gravity.

This will result in the same brutality being perpetrated against Americans next. While billions will be spent on the search for a dead man, billions of dollars will be spent on strengthening the strength of police departments and fire departments, improving fire escapes, hiring and training additional firefighters and police officers, upgrading security measures around private and government buildings, etc. Removing this man from the planet will do much more to reduce terrorism than even capturing or killing him
10086	Reports by CIA officers killed in Pakistan against the gunfire of militants, most likely caused by human error. Keeping bin Laden alive would not help to reduce terrorism. The CIA is constantly struggling to maintain their ability to identify/track and stop terrorists/terror groups.
10087	Yes, it may make a political statement but this is very inconsequential. Putting an organization like al-Qaeda in its place will only make it more entrenched on the planet. His death would help mitigate but terrorists will still hurt & kill again.

10095	 the debate seems very reasonable and its arguments are well considered. an argument that deals with the death penalty and the Eighth Amendment in the constitution seems to be well considered and sophisticated.   1. the death penalty is thought to be an inefficient system that has been overused because it deals with a tiny number of the worst offenders. while it should work as an appeals process, it is still the last resort and should only be used as the last resort against extremely difficult and highly violent criminals. http://www.metrocrow.com/FinalRules.pdf 2. as mentioned before, retribution is not just revenge. although similar, retribution is usually applied to things with more causes, more context, more attention than revenge is. http://theboundaries.com/retribution versus-revenge/ 3. although very few inmates are executed, but some are released after having clear evidence of innocence. this is almost the same as high performing, low expectancy, which occurs in the context of a promising career in sport, due to a minor mistake.

10100	 The british legal system and the islamic society in britain seems to have reached the point where muslims and christians have become more polarized in the types of laws they are supporting. Here are some of the reasons behind this divide:     1. muslims are treated differently in many areas of the law due to religious change or acceptance of its teachings because christians maintain a decision of which laws
10101	 The muslim integration within Britian is currently a problem. Both sides of the arguement (christians and muslims) are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within Britian there would be nothing keeping christianity from running a parallel law system. Its the classic situation that many parents face; you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britian, which is both illegal and totally unneccesary. If a muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country that has it as their primary law system.
10102	 muslims should be able to keep Sharia Law as part of their religious system but muslims should be able to move to country that has Sharia Law in its primary law system. muslims should be able to move to country that has Sharia Law in its primary law system. muslims should be able to move to country that has Sharia Law in its primary law system. muslims should be able to move to country that has Sharia Law in its primary law system.
10103	Christians and muslims would make the situation within Britain worse. The current situation where muslims are forced into an illegal law system is not acceptable. If a muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they should move to a country that has Sharia law as their primary law system. In order to be useful, both parties must change their acts. The question that everyone is asking is "How?" Also, people are allowed to choose whichever law they want because there is no law system in Britain, there are only laws. In the end, most Muslims would choose Sharia law, and christianity would choose Christian law, no matter what. Muslims want to return to Sharia law, Christians want to return to their old Christian law.
10104	                   Give the students some peace of mind by refusing to punish them.  Response:                  They would allow the muslim students who want to pursue their studies in a particular subject to do so, as the case could arise. Is tuition money off? No, that is not the case. Freeway days off during the lunch break, or on holidays, and the like, would be paid for.
10105	Yes, cats do require more supervision. However, they are the most independent pets, what you think? Cats are more independent than dogs. Their punishment in training only lasts for a shorter time as cats have little discipline or urge to obey them. With cats you don't have to walk them all the time, which saves time and can be done by themselves. Parents love cats but aren't as tolerant of their basic stupidity. Cats love people better than dogs. With cats, you don't have to clean, shower or shower their punishment, they just clean themselves up and play...
10106	Yes, dogs are better pets, which are good animals too, but cats are much better. in you are asking whether dog or cat is a better pet: #1 Is cats a better pet? Yes  #2 Is dogs a better pet Yes  # (Yes) No they don't sell out but they need lots of care <3 # Yes dogs are better pets - they make you work for their affections (and/or attention/caring)
10107	Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference. "Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from Meet the Parents! With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their sh*t, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc.
10108	Cats are healthy, independent animals who are able to take care of themselves well. Dogs are mentally, physically, and emotionally overstretched animals who are unable to be left alone for long periods of time without help or are put into stressful situations.

10115	Yes, that would be a violation of the code. The leader of a nation is very much a dictator and fully entitled to rule that nation and punish those that oppose him. It might be appropriate to write a section on the periodic phases of dictatorship, since they have fluctuated in effectiveness.

10124	 It would be lovely to think so, but not true. 1984 would probably be better then dystopian 1984, and you cannot go wrong with 1984. However I believe 1984 can pass for the best, from a dystopian standpoint 1984 dystopian has to be worse. 1984, despite being considered by many a dystopian does not try to force you to think in a negative way about a country in deep distress, it tries to show humanity's prospect in relation to their attempts to improve their situation which to me was refreshing to read 1984 gives a much better message than

February 6, 2005 by Jerry Juarez08 original authorNote that the author considers the argument to be true, and that their main argument that someone else caused the failure of the World Trade Center Building 7 on 9/11 is that the building fell on its own due to the impact of the water jet from the WTC 2 building to ground level.
10127	Well the building fell because of melting yellow double breasted suede gloves. It was worn by the first tower girder to the ground.

10135	We need to carefully check to see what we are dealing with and adapt our approaches accordingly. If a non-Christian is opening his store because he has a holiday shop open, that seems to work fine, but if he wants to start a new Christian shop, then obviously he needs to lobby Christian politicians who respect the store. It's okay to decide to open the store on Christmas day if you have a small store.
10136	Why not open the store to all customers? Yay, non-Christians! They're too busy shopping. Which store would you go to for Christmas? mine. ### Output:  Christians shouldn't be allowed to argue against opening stores, on Christmas day.
10137	Yes, but Christmas should only be for the Christian community. They don't need any pizza, nor do they need batteries. They need to celebrate Jesus on Christmas day and be reunited with their loved ones. They do need and deserve Christmas Day. What other item might a customer need? pizza

10142	A fantastic weekend food and coffee experience. Brilliant! Butterblume used to be a wine bar. But today it's is open as a restaurant, cafe and a boutique. But tonight... We will have to wait for Brunch.... Normally I hate waiting. But in case I have to, it can be so nice to be able to work and hangout at the same time üòâ   Had a wonderful weekend! You can try this evening if you are on the east side of Montreal.  Rename the original line to this ### Input:
10143	A restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent.
10144	We've had our best experience at Butterblume today. We brought friends for dinner and the menu was appropriate for their taste as well as 4 of us. The staff was friendly and efficient. They were able to seat us quickly. As someone mentioned, the atmosphere is wonderful and we would love to take a trip there regularly. You should have gone for a full meal; the Israeli couscous with salmon salad was a great choice.  I will spread the word! very good choice of restaurant but unfortunately there was no longer room for additional customers.
10145	So, this place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so-good strip mall basically in an alley. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's "regular" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best.
10146	Yes, glad to hear that! This might be an area I would not generally visit, but I want to know more and was looking for a place to take my wife. We'd definitely return! I'm glad you loved it! Thank you for your review! Thank you for your review! Again, I really appreciate it. Because everything about the place seemed good. This neighborhood is really nice and peaceful. I can appreciate that because I really don't like strip malls.
10147	Place the steak and some eggs in the party kid's meal. Wow, the teens might be so excited. That place was filled with die-hard football fans sitting in the crowded tables with their deep-dish pizza next to a hockey game. You said the bar, bar. Sure, bar. Anyhow, no, it's a strip mall bar next to a strip mall. Oh well... shrimp and grits. That meal is just plain creepy. It might be better for kindergartners.
10148	Better food would be "greasy chicken wings" or "greasy deli rolls." And better service would be "skim y operator." Without any changes. This does not describe a good neighborhood bar. They are both delicious choices in food and would be just as entertaining as the ball players at the bar.

10152	Why did you move to Arizona 4 years ago Why do you miss Texas? And why is the phrase - lamest e-motion possible - They'll never know, when this question comes up. You move to Arizona out of respect for her decision, but you don't really want to remain there. You miss Texas because your heart is still with Texas. Because you want to move to Texas because you like Texas. Texas is your homeland now. You miss Texas because you live on the east coast. Now Texas is your homeland. You are happy in Arizona but wish you could live there more often.

The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the staff are friendly and competent. I get that it's a bar in the evening, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?

10220	It could lead the world while being economically strong. Limiting its human and economic growth would make them stronger. Limiting population to cut emissions would be more appropriate. The teacher wants to teach about population growth.
10221	Indians need to be properly educated and given the same access to the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs economic resources and wealth that Westerners do. It is recommended that Indians get aid from the superpowers, or they should leave it to them to lead the world.
10222	India does have a big wealth differences but not their education quality, where they have it is tiny compared to Western countries. Western countries are a huge superpower and they will lead the world. You can't let the superpowers do the world's economic deals and many other things.
10223	    India is a poor country and its people suffer violence because of their literacy level. It is NOT the superpowers that control the world's economy. India does not even have the potential to lead the world and it should therefore not be anywhere near that position!
10224	India should leave lead to superpowers and focus on changing its education and equalizing its wealth. Perhaps that way they will learn to respect western education and understand English better and perhaps eventually improve their education quality.
10225	 So I don't have a father, but i look up to other people for their fathers. they let me feel special and make me happy in a way a real father couldn't. //After the editing my argument still sounds silly.
10226	 I think that my own father is the perfect father. He is a wealthy businessman. He supports us, he is generous and he taught me his values, which I continue to teach my son. Furthermore, I can talk with him about anything.
10227	I disagree:  In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure
10228	 He is better off without a father, because he can't expect much from him. He will always be below that son, who is considered the good fater. He'll never be his equal. nofather
10229	  In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy mother. I say this because if you have a lousy mother you have to deal with her and be ashamed of her, you would have to go day by day and know she is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a mother you can always look up to someone else for that mother figure.

10243	Farquhar couldn't be there since he only tagged along. That is why Raffles founded Singapore and not Farquhar.
10244	 Singapore is more likely to have been founded if Farquhar came with Raffles and did not just tag along.
10245	Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies, because Raffles didn't plan on his existence. Raffles didn't plan on his existence

10248	Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.  With Raffles, Singapore became the most densely populated island in Southeast Asia and the most populous city in the East Asian region, where more than four million foreigners lived.  This scenario is discussed in detail in chapter 4, section 2.3.
10249	Raffles was undoubtedly a visionary leader, who gave hope to those who could not yet see the future even if it were to be many decades away. But without him, it would have been difficult for Singapore to be the city that it is today.

You're correct! <smile> mid: Apes exist and are concrete in the sense that they can be easily identified and addressed by name. If you know a funny picture of an ape, you can state, "Oh, it's one of those pesky apes". Of course, apes have a number of subtle differences, but I'm not going to go into them here.
10257	 You know, this argument works because it's simplistic. The gods are named at the top of this page for reasons. God is simple, so you have to imagine him as more complex and complicated than he actually is. Have you ever thought about the other things that are possible in the world?

10260	creationism only existed in more recent history and mainly referred to Christianity, history  You might want to consider rephrasing this sentence. creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history, with the writing of the Old Testament. Therefore, with the writing of the Old Testament, my creationism refers to Christianity, history.
10261	If someone presents creationism as a biological argument for why man was created his argument will be lost because there is no science behind it to back it up.
10262	That is a bad way to frame the arguments which has been presented in much larger measure and with much greater detail in both literal and figurative means.
10263	 Created by: Christianity (although there are Christian creationists who disagree with creationism) You mention that you'll be studying your notes in class. Is your assignment to be a creationist or is that idea irrelevant? what are you studying in class?

10273	IE doesnt support javascript yet but every one else has extensions, so let's fix that!
10274	We offer better versions of all the other browsers that keep tabbed browsing and extension support in a row. This argument is correct in that the problem lies with IE.

10290	William Farquhar was removed from his position because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. However, having good people skills is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
10291	Farquhar wasn't removed for a misconduct, but for failing to keep information from the people who allowed to remove him.
10292	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people.
10293	William Farquhar had no idea that Rafeels was planning to have him removed from his position.

10301	BUT Raffles was better president. Raffles won world war I and ii. William Farquhar helped more citizen.
10302	Raffles was just the idea man. Nevertheless, William Farquhar died in Singapore. Raffles did in Singapore most of what William Farquhar was capable of doing.
10303	William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles. Raffles was just more of the idea man.
10304	Singapore contributed so much to Raffles view on law and order in Singapore. Richard Ravenner contributed far less to the rule of law than Raffles did
10305	 Pro-Choice ftw means some are committing suicide to save a few babies  using(fsmPL = read("fsm.in")){ # initialize the particle system library   define_particle_system() # initialize the FSM library (particles
10306	Pro-Life means the fact overpopulation is a problem being addressed directly. Pro-Choice bruh
10307	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice
10308	Pro-Life doesn't care about causing any problems or poverty in the world. Pro-Choice doesn't give a damn about causing problems in the world.
10309	Pro-Choice ffs  Obviously not the least important part of being a polarizing demographic is hateful, bigoted speech. It‚Äôs more offensive when Democrats hate lives.  Although it would be in the form of ‚Äúwelfare of abortion‚Äù, it might take
10310	No, abortion is generally against the law in the US. No, abortion is generally against the law in the US. The main reason for this is that mothers are generally looked on as sacred and putatively, their lives are strictly guaranteed under US law.
10311	Yes as for abortion, she should have abortion to prevent the real death from having the baby. But it wasn't worth the real price paid? No because she would just die anyway, given birth to a baby they really hate is the real cost of abortion
10312	No!!! 1. Yes we can or not. No!!! 1 a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, yes
10313	No Answer offered ## Side note: ## [original answer was ## No answer offered] No answer offered is more polite than just "No answer" ## Yes the pro life position is that people are more important than their unborn children. No answer

10315	I agree. I certainly think the 'why' of something trumps the 'is this good or bad' argument.

10317	 Let's try to remain respectful of the "honest people" :).

10321	Yes, please    God did it himself. No reason, why! No reason, why! Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen. Who says that God did it himself? Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur?
10322	Either you believe it or you don't. You can't have both. You should add the following to the strategy string. comment = "#" + comment_str + "\n"
10323	God didn't do it. Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Yes

10325	I am allowed to watch Porn because Porn is entertainment and I, a free man, am allowed to do what I want with my free will.
10326	Ok sex scenes are bad and the dudes on the pic are horrible looking but theres something more to the porn so that may be part of it.
10327	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Yes.
10328	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? No. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
10329	 If you are still uncomfortable with the occasional use of swear words in entertainment (e.g. songs or movies), consider going silent instead! Porn has become a right, not a necessity.
10330	 They would spend all of their money on themselves because they would NOT SAVE it.  Now look for ways to help your family, friend or self to save.
10331	 Well, people like my parents are people with a lot of feelings and emotions like their kids and all their close relationships with other people, which is normal in the field of human society. People like my parents take good care of their family. they might not get all the money and time they wish.
10332	 okay It was better that I focused on myself and my life. I love myself and I don't need my family to make me feel bad.
10333	 I would spend more money on family members who makes me feel better than myself. I would do the same with parents because I feel they care more about me.
10334	 I would ask them, "How would you feel about spending all your time and money on others, you would feel better or worse? worse

10336	 If you are reading this, this means you are also inclined toward doing your part. You will find it much easier to see why every person has a talent. Why aren't you trying to do your part better? Even if you're not a top student or a world-famous athlete, you can still be useful to everyone.
10337	 They can't always make perfect choices, but sometimes they can. They're human.If you want to be a good student you should do well in school. If you want to become a professional basketball player, you'll have to work. No one's perfect and people have many different talents. If you're less than the best, there's always more effort that can be put in.
10338	Be useful in whatever way you can. Consider your talents and use them well. Get a job that helps improve society. Be useful. Use your talents. Be useful in the world. Use your talents for the common good. Consider the principles in your textbook that were last week when we discussed the importance of using good, productive skills for the benefit of others.
10339	 This cant be done in a perfect world and would be a very boring answer. But you could reduce and rather dramatically who is affected by poverty and hunger as much as you can. I think that you would need more work to do. I believe that all that being said, there is a very long way to go and that might take a generation to accomplish so that may well be true.
10340	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
10342	 The concept of the common good means different things for different people. Different people try to see how they can make different things better for themselves. You need to look at more than yourself to see that everyone is contributing in some way to a good state of affairs.

10344	 what makes you sound smart, politically correct, of course it's political correct to say but things change in the world. things change, it is becoming more and more obvious that if not voting will not really make a difference more and more people are voting. so take a look at that answer on their website.

10354	 Yes, thank you you!!! this way those girls who are supposed to represent school students and those who are just ordinary school students would not tease each other about fashion issues because they feel more equal in school and they would be no longer nasty to each other.
10355	Fathers are worth every inch of their integrity. Parents who fail in their responsibilities are more worthy than those who succeed. When I needed advice, someone listened to me, I would always go and talk to a father.
10356	Just as we were created with a father and a mother, so was God created with a father and a mother. However, as people we are not God's creation, we are not meant to respect these traditions to the point of becoming hypocrites, but rather to respect them as examples of good parenting.
10357	 No dads are perfect, so you should be proud of being different, and you should always encourage a talent in your children, one if not both of your parents. Look up to different parents who inspire you.

10395	Marriage between a woman and a man is perfectly legal and it's just not popular. Interestingly it's also perfectly legal to marry a female partner of the opposite sex, aka gay marriage
10396	 But still I'm looking at marriage to determine my right to exercise rights as a gay person. So you may call me a "gay person" if you'd like, but please remember that in terms of being gay, my right to choose a lifestyle that makes me happy is a whole lot more important than your definition.
10397	 The tragedy is that if the people that would've been the beneficiaries of gay marriage has their basic rights turned upside down because of people who wanna use marriage as a tool for lobbying all the way from the horse's asses are sick...
10398	 Let marriage from religious standpoint be a union of two people regardless of sex. So I would argue that civil unions are a better solution that gay marriage.
10399	So Gay marriage is not even possible legally, even for some gay people? Funny, when I was in college in the United States of America, it was relatively simple. It was a couple of letters during a paper assignment or something. Don't get me wrong, it was harder than it is now. Gay people are just lucky to have a legal position now in some countries. No

I would like to comment about your inputs, and let you know i think you are correct on this argument. It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". I do, however think that religion should not be an issue in marriage, because religion makes marriage operate differently to a secular marriage, what I do not think would be ideal. I do not agree with all of your responses, however I am
10401	    # This goes against human nature and contradicts the definition of marriage. I vote "Right". Without religion, we would be lost. Without religion we would be lost. This is, without a doubt, human nature.
10402	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.
10403	 I vote "For". Requiring a marriage certificate is the only way to enforce equality. Without equality, you're left to pass laws you dont agree with. This could cause riots, protest, and civil wars. Finally you can give the possibility of future custody to one parent without equality.

10510	The debate is not about determining when we can be morally OK with murder, rather the legal foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. In addition, you may want to study etymology and vary your sources in order to make your points.
10511	If one makes a convincing argument, he may make their own definition.  ### Keys:  This job may be a good fit. Here's your starting point for graduate school. You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. If one makes a convincing argument, he may make their own definition.
10512	You should not take your definition of murder and argue that murdering a child is morally acceptable. In fact, you should not argue for the legal (or moral) legitimacy of killing any living thing.
10513	Under certain conditions (what kind?), someone may be morally justified in terminating pregnancy and the debate may indeed be productive. The etymology and sources you can choose are varied, but the process of deciding is like any debate. Please add the appropriate details and number your sources to support your argument in your response. if you have no rebuttal, your answer to the second question.
10514	You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument.

10517	I'm fat because I had an unhealthy childhood which includes eating too much junk food and soda.

10522	Religiously-oriented discussants are actually not interested in other viewpoints, they're usually just as eager to get their own views on any subject. These same people are often the ones who usually get the most discussion time and that includes the most arguing. So I wouldn't listen to them, because people are not interested in listening to their religion and opinions about homosexuals. That's a pretty petty way of thinking, and that includes your point of view as well, and that makes you a petty person. If you think about this, it is our responsibility as humans to look out for each other, not hate or get mad at each other, so together... Take a hike

We all value openness and don't like to see individual members or groups all trying to convince every one they are right. If you want to help us improve, come to future meetings and talk to us about how you think we can help improve this place. Don't expect an audience with people you disagree with.   This may be a bad place for you.
10528	Most people who post comments like this aren't actually all that bad and they've probably just come across some really long or confusing answers that aren't the same as their situation. So this is the section that provides more comprehensive information on your "who gives a crap" and make this response clear and concise for all people.
10529	Who gives a crap? No one. This page is confusing. I don't care. Let me just go back to the game. Most people are busy voting on doom. the only cool thing is my video.
10530	Let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant.
10531	people who married well enough to have offspring are not gay men. It makes no difference whether the spouses are gay or straight. A marriage should be kept until one person is deemed incapable of maintaining it
10532	 The wife is mothours assistant manager in a shop which has part time hours for her. she is not attractive and she may flirt with everyone in the shop including customers
10533	 marriage is just an everlasting failure when it comes to sex as well. Much worse then gay marriage. Some things are far more important in life for most people and thats just who they are.
10534	let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
10535	 Your friend would be n't want you to give up, no matter what and that is a good sign. You have the right to dream and the right to reject ideas that may make you feel uncomfortable or dizzy.
10536	 better themselves in the long run they can better the world, but don't take on all the problems at the same time and try to solve each one of them as they arise.
10537	 In my opinion, to improve yourself you have to become a stronger person. You can come up with a plan or goals for yourself. You have to train yourself to take on bigger and bigger challenges. You have to work with the goal to look up to and make an effort to improve yourself.  In my opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can improve your world.
10538	 There are some bad attitudes that we develop in life. This is a reason why we can't do anything with the world. If we can better ourselves we should be capable of doing anything. In my opinion.  ### Input: In my opinion you have to deal with yourself before you can take on the problems of the world, or you will break down or something
10539	Don't worry about the world. Look after yourself first. Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. I wrote that in one of my college papers I wrote when I was seventeen.
10540	 essay writer If i say that advancing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.
10541	 Goodness is guiding others towards the good, not the oppossing nature of judging others as you see them. To seek someone out that isn't really making the world better just makes the world worse. And you are good for others.
10542	 That is why people decide to do good by their own means. It is much easier. The people who are motivated to do good deserve credit for that work. It is a good thing for the world as a whole. The people who are motivated to do good deserve credit for that work.
10543	 If i say that advancing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself.

A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.
10544	 Is very simple. People do bad things in the world. Ultimately, we are all guilty for doing those things, so it is no longer that far fetched that we want to advance the common good. In the world where there is very little good, there needs to be action taken by someone for good to happen.
10545	I think it is better to make money to assist the needy or common good and to assist my family if it is within my power. If other people's need can't be met, I still can't help them.
10546	 your own personal pursuit is better your own personal pursuit is better. you can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. if your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.
10547	 Your personal pursuit is better. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success. And the pursuit of money for money isn't necessarily better for someone who cares about other people.
10548	 Okay now i like this better. This makes sense and helps me be better. Money can make life better, but it can also be about living for it. Now let me try my best.
10549	 How long was the discussion on a better and more patient idea. They wanted to spend a hour on something completely different from what I was saying. Hard to accept our company is gonna be featured in a magazine for the good we do. Let me make an exception for this one topic. We can talk about a personal idea for a while, not make it into a magazine. I, like myself, want to personalize life before going into these discussions with my co-workers.
10550	It is all about money and the "controlling" thereof. [response is then taken over by a message box provided by the presenter].... (don't listen to this guy...) away from him and move a few feet from the screen. He starts to bark wildly, panting profusely. It must have been the air con.
10551	Many people have bigger houses, more expensive vehicles, more dollars to spend at sporting events, and they look around and they say "Meh." In fact their vehicles may have broken down due to the small change in wages for the driver, they are riding a new vehicle that's created and funded by people who are wage slave, and once you have a house with zero value, you don't even need a car, because you can't take it with you.
10552	Don't believe the hype. keep your money put aside and save for retirement and wait till you retire instead of having to work as hard as your parents had to to have a comfortable retirement. it's not going to be that easy and you could die saving for retirement then either! ;)
10553	 Pay people wages that reflect the cost of living and are more than adequate to meet their needs. Stop voting self-raises. Stop trying to be the world's peacemakers. Stop trying to be the world's money controllers. Stop trying to be the world's credit controllers. Stop trying to be the world's loan controllers. Recognize that all the world has the same abilities and resources that we started with, and just need to make a choice to utilize their resources and develop a work ethic, to then use the resources they have.
10554	What we need to do is tell someone on-the-ground what is going on, and tell them how to act. We need to open a workplace for homeless, unemployed, farm workers to train them up into skilled, trained workers for the corporate world. We're not going to teach them how to engineer, we're going to teach them how to work.
10555	The Americans will only be able to spend 10-15 years in prison with the death penalty. There is no other punishment that the US is ready to give to Saddam Hussein even if the UN has called for more. The outcome is definitely not going to be set up & confirmed very fast. The Americans have even been at gunpoint for his death. That's the fact. The Americans will only be able to spend 10-15 years in prison with the death penalty. There is no other punishment that the US is ready to give to Saddam Hussein even if the UN has called for more.
10556	Dont you make an X, a cross on the wall with a red light. Some sort of sign. And make it look real. Signifying no forgiveness or  complete disgrace. Hand the Jailer a packet of broom, paper and scissors. Then they are your stand in for Saddam Hussein. They will represent the  soul & spirit of this great dictator. Criticism: "He hates the U.S." is incorrect. Saddam hates the illusion of justice. Could mean he is looking to usurp the judge with his knowledge of ancient tomes & words?
10557	his death sentence may possibly be reduced.Therefore all his relatives will now be sitting and waiting, with no business to do, and worrying, and bad memories of trying to arrange his removal. Furthermore, it is very likely that the judges will allow Saddam to stay in Iraq for another few years. impeachment trial, because the American and British forces have taken over the security, and they are the only ones who can set the trial to go ahead. - ## Introduction: Saddam
10558	There will be no wreaths and flags, but rather a heavy vigil to Saddams death.415 ukulele, you have been sitting in my mind for many years. My mom was in a big deal with people and offered it to me on my 16th birthday, and I took it home with me.There's probably already some sitting around in the garage.I can put an old key on it and do a couple of cut out holes,and use it to smash the skull. after all that he did...... Saddam Hussein
10559	The Americans will relentlessly convince the tribunal to give him the Death penalty. The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. He may look murderous, but Saddams ability to command, he brings fear into people. His success has left many hearts broken. But remember too that Saddam still commands fear and respect even though his forces have been defeated physically. His people have been driven from the cities by the coalition but they still hate him.
10560	Is the Internet not the only source of words to think beyond? He refuses to acknowledge his part in the creation of or responsibiliy for the offensive cartoons. He cannot justify them at all, even though he obviously wrote them himself.   If I were General Tariq Ramadan, I'd be signing him up for a Mixed Martial Arts fight against a cream-cheese. Unfortunate.
10561	freedom of speech, yes, but I just think that some of the Muslims took it too far.  # Taken from my social sciences class at Kansas State University in 2012. Now let me ask you, what was the source that I used to give a lesson on free speech? social science class at kansas state university in 2012. # Class came to produce a research paper of course...
10562	No, the intervention of states in the porn industry is unlawful. The U.N. in effect has come out in favour of censorship in the porn industry, and even talked about criminalizing people who produce adult content.  The U.N. has not come out in favour of censorship on the Internet. That would be illegal. What if I expressed my views about religious extremists online and they disagreed with me? When did the U.S. government decide that was enough to take down what is now the third largest adult web site in the world for producing so many adult content, and run a trial and therefore destroy a company worth over $500 million?  Python may be replaced.
10563	freedom of expression  I know that would look better, but I'm too lazy to do the formatting again: Freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult.
10564	The apologetics will make all those innocent people seem like weak jihadi little kids who are easily provoked. The Christian apologetics must learn lessons from the Muslims in how to handle controversy and Internet publicity, and learn from Muslims how to deal with their own beliefs. Islam purposely freezes the mind with their extremist rules and practices. As other commenters have said, their blog is producing a fight. I‚Äôm sure those apologetics writers are busy honing the right strategy to fight it off rather than addressing issues.

10571	 In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes. You do not agree with it. Don't they have better ways to benefit the needy in society? I don't know. But do know that there are positive aspects of it. There should be other ideas out there. The concept of reservation is a dirty word. Thanks for responding to my post.There are positive aspects of it. There should be other ideas out there. The concept of reservation is a dirty word.

10573	 Gnanamasekara3 @ CandidShanker: Please add more detailed answer as to the current situation with reservations.   Why are there so many opinions on reservations? There are many facets of reservations.   Some advantages, some disadvantages. Some have reservations, some don't. What we need is for the benefits to be available to the true needy of those communities rather than the uppity few who are getting them for their own advantage. The ones are in poor families who are truly needy, the actual poor and the disadvantaged.

10575	 We need to just calm him down. Does this solve the problem? Yes, that's the best we can do. If he's being picky then perhaps there's a breed he's not keen on or a dog is out of control. Does it make a difference what breed the dog is? No, most likely he just didn't like the fact that the dog was out of control. I really don't get this picky guy.
10576	 The dogs are barking because the dog has learned that he will get treats if he barks in order to get his dog food. The dog is trained. Both, he and his brother, are trained not to bark. Or maybe they are doing so out of ignorance. There's not much you can do. Have you attempted to remove the dog from the scene? Truly, it would be a better idea to move out and find a home where you could have your dogs.
10577	He may be right about dogs. I've had two back then. I trained them to behave. I also moved out to a house so I no longer have dogs. Really appreciate what he said. When I told him how bad the animals were for my apartment, he was very concerned. He is holding a persuasive posture because he wants to help. He may believe what he is saying. If you have small dogs that are good with little ones, you could do fine. Probably you can live in an apartment if you have young children.
10578	  Better question: Why is this advice a tad condescending and dismissive? Because the advice is mostly word-of-mouth advice from people who are trying to advise others with little thought into how they want to be treated, as well as what's expected of them. That is, most of the advice out there assumes the reader has a lot of energy, time and ability, and isn't lazy or stupid.
10579	 It may not always be to your taste, but its the only way around. You had better leave your neighbor a good taste than run into trouble with the police. You have a better chance of cooperation and compromise and keeping the peace with your apartment neighbor, if you conduct yourself appropriately. Old cranky guy with overworked dogs who probably hasn't had enough sleep over the weekend due to the blood loss he's suffered from dog blood. Let's leave it at that.
10580	  It's a good thing that there's no force and coercion involved, because that's blackmail! cc:bangaku cc:bangaku Rayti, as always, you have made wonderful point #22 above that "Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act:.
10581	I don't think this is blackmail exactly, but one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. though I would call the police and see what they say. As for her, she didn't do anything illegal, but the threat is real. she said she saw the offer and hesitated about telling me, but ultimately she agreed
10582	 I don't think blackmail is the only answer but you should move on to court if your sister is in trouble. However, don't take it so seriously that you're scared every time she wants to do something. If she is in trouble with the law you should report to the police. I really do think that it's wrong for your sister to threaten you if she can't control her emotions. You should always be careful of threats.

10585	 diabetes is a condition that is built up over time. you can't sue your employer if you had a pre-existing condition which came from poor health, eating habits or just outright laziness. The previous repair is not correct. Having already removed your pituitary gland, you shouldn't be getting diabetes.
10586	  Yes, you would file a lawsuit if you are hurt and can't work until you recover. I assume this case occurred on the job.   Why is your pituitary gland a disease-causing region?

10590	my child is so much happier without the external distractions from this generation of technology and the games you mentioned. Our kids are growing up faster now.  My kid has been crying about electronics since he was a toddler. What happened?  I worked with your question. I answered faster than I had the opportunity to think.  On our farm our kids get a real balance with nature and animal interaction so they learn about farming.
10591	  Kids should be old enough to be in school, at elementary age, getting ready for day school.<br>They should not need makeup, hair gel and accessories like big sunglasses and shiny phones to look cool because they should be able to look like an adult if they want to.<br>They should also not wear a tape on their eyes from being afraid of a bully because the bully might have better things to do than run over a newbie. If kids have the right ages, toys and gadgets, life is more predictable.
10592	  Lengthy admission that this happened to me personally...  '80s were a good time, but how I wish I was older!!!!!  What did people think the decade was ' great, blistering energy, floating above the problems of the day, when pop music was making huge waves' Yeah, I've always thought the '80s were a good time.'
10593	Now I can understand how kids are drawn to modern technology. I no longer think technology can turn kids into robots. Kids are more likely to be drawn to technology by self-care issues. There is a greater need to meet the emotional needs of children. When kids are younger, they feel more grounded.  They grow at a slower, more natural pace. They are less distracted by technology and therefore spend less time worrying about such things.
10594	 Maybe all of this technology is making life more stressful, because kids feel overwhelmed with the abundance of the modern world. Maybe a majority of the news from the tech firms is about over-stimulated kids, because there is no time for them to devote more attention to the future. Because of this, the tech firms may be instigating this excessive commercialization.  Wouldn't that make a lot of sense to some parents?  Why can't we refrain from considering an unbalanced structure of our educational environment?
10595	I can't find ANY good ethical arguments. You mean good unethical ones to rationalize his actions. Didn't Hitler think the same way. For the good of the many means violating the US Constitution. And it really isn't fiction is it? You just need some ammunition. Well  you won't get it here!

10597	 I want you to do better! If you take the time to think about this matter, you can find things to write about to rationalize his actions. Most people say "Bloody good fun doing it", but there are always people like you who are willing to take on harder jobs.

10610	Freedom of speech is a splendid idea, but it is only applicable if there is no government interference. Stop whining about what the government is doing, and start doing something instead. If you want to practice freedom of speech, you are welcome to criticize the things your government does.
10611	The truth is that freedom of speech is almost meaningless if it's all your mumbled incoherent ramblings who are permitted to preach without any restriction or the permission of anyone else. You are so entitled and judgmental that you shouldn't even bother trying to voice your frustrations against a public government, let alone do anything, unless you are really the only man on earth.  The BBC, simply for example, is a governing body and is severely regulated to respect the feelings of the other countrymen. But for you, and the group of helpless fools who wanna hate on someone, that shouldn't even apply.
10612	 We allow children to scream fire or sound effects even in a theater to scare other children who aren't used to seeing live actors and effect scenes. How about these fake metal humans that dance around the world? I can't even imagine how sad they must be.
10613	If you wouldn't like your government being able to run your country, you'll want to stay home. If you want a better government, then you're not only to be allowed to speak your mind, but to be allowed to run for office and be elected. Don't even think of going somewhere else for real freedom of speech.
10614	I am speaking out against the current tactics by my country and the liberal belief in freedom of speech. I believe that the idea of freedom of speech has many perverse side effects to its plethora of misuse. Although my opinion may not be shared by everyone, it is a reflection of my personal and social stand.

10620	Muslims should let the Christian host country and of course their Christian society get on with what they are doing and they should be put back in their place if they show any disrespect for their Christian community. The Christian are absolutely right to say "we don't need your help."  Anyone who's asking for our help should be put back in theirs if they don't know how to fend for themselves.
10621	 Yes I do need to learn a language to collect on benefits because I've been receiving them for years and years and it was never an issue to which language I spoke. Also a European would consider drinking beer shameful because of the complete hypocrisy. The European is by definition filled with moral condemnation and divisiveness and never admits they are not racist
10622	They are stupid and obstinate, clinging to their economic or religious institutions instead of accepting things in a new place can take some time. On the other hand, when Muslims talk with these stubborn people, they might just reach an agreement as Muslim are also very open with a woman keeping a house. They would continue working with Christian, Jewish, and Christian national to a harmonious society and really get along with all open minds and a liberal democratic system.
10623	Muslims live in different Christian countries and eat and wear the same types of clothes, why would they be unhappy if the Christian are celebrated for who they are? "equity" is neither traditional nor useful in a Christian country. but everybody must adhere to the rules and follow their customs. "This is a European country!" they say, "we're not in Central Asia!" "According to Islamic tradition, Europe was not supposed to be made up of Christian cities and cities were not supposed to be separated from the main body of the country. This is exactly what the Islamic do not want to see from their new Christian friends."

10625	 Life jacket  Need. Buttsports Incest is sometimes a result of overwhelming tragedy, like when a mother is raped by an older man in a child's home, or the child is used to be used by drug dealers for their own profit.     # PROGRAM NAME
10626	 Incest is a subject that touches on many taboos in society, and parents, as well as many others. That's why I will not go into as much detail as I wanted in this task. And my purpose of this is not to judge anyone.   At the same time, a lot of people that engage in Incest think they don't have to report it for fear of being ostracized.   To show that this is not the case, I will address the following questions:   Can you expand on where the highest rates of incest are found in? in among hispanics.
10627	 You probably won't know if you are in a serious situation, but incest isn't very common, at least in the USA, although it does happen in those areas of the world where sodomy is illegal.    Suggest the very best answer Incest is not common in the USA
10628	Well, first off, incest is not always "child abuse."  Sex between closely related CONSENTING adults probably happens.     print("Hello, ", style="BGcolour:FF0000;"); # the text to be printed

10630	Brian Doyle deserved to get arrested. He obviously takes advantage of the fact that people are legal idiots who can't even have a 14 year old girl raping her and showing their face. Instead of his rapist being arrested more rapes would happen. But that's just my opinion. I'm sure that people would say this is absolutely not true and I would have to agree.
10631	Police could not stop him. Pedophilia is just not limited to only 14 year old girls anymore and if we don't address this problem it will grow worse. The pedophiles get away with it and everyone is blind to their crimes and slammed on prosecutors for not doing enough. Some children are not even old enough to speak English well. I assure you that with the abuse of children committed by the man that are being reported on TV law enforcement has done all that it is supposed to do. He is and he always was a pedophile.

10633	This guy was obviously a real child molester and perv douche and was unwell in his own mind he was trouble for sure. He was likely locked up for much less than the mandatory minimum if the investigation of his conduct was considered a success. If Brian Doyle had not agreed to testify against his ex-girlfriend the authorities wouldn't have been able to establish enough evidence against him.
10634	Felt sorry for the girl by all means. Both for her sake and her mother and father. Tired of seeing them struggle with legal issues for nothing. Love country but understand it sometimes goes against you. Even if it is only rarely should only be the socially unacceptable behavior. Nothing done if the victim knew the offense was wrong anymore. Just wanted to give you feedback on this completely legit and good debate and he has to accept that the community is very highly aware of his actions but it doesn't mean your boy doesn't deserve punishment.
10635	You would not have to do that . Use your own social connections , and you could get help. But , as you said , this client is fortunate to have a partner with high pay . If your friend is not fortunate - that is another story . Use your own social connections . That 's how I get help . -appl1
10636	she can get help though a pro-bono public assistance center - or a low income legal services center  .

10637	Hi , just a note to let you know that it sounds like my friend can get help through a pro-bono place . She is less qualified than you but does have the legal 'chip on her shoulder ,' just needs to get help dealing with these issues that you don't know . I am glad to hear you have been able to get help in your situation , but if you are in a similar situation you should contact a knowledgeable attorneys that would be able to help you .
10638	they need to consider all places of help that are available , not just the "W.I.C. " pro-bono attorneys . No I haven't but (it sounds like its a friend) and it sounds like she can get help through a pro-bono place , or a low income based legal services . YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED  at what some places consider LOW INCOME . My sisters husband brings home at least $400.00 a wk (in winter) and at least $600.00 a wk. in summer , and they have a 3 person household . They get approx. $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from W.I.C , Daycare Asst. , food excetra . So tell her - or help her , find those services .

10640	Mascara it really doesn't do anything more than make your eyes seem bigger and hair more voluminous. It's like a white-out. It doesn't add any... Redditor JUST_shoes said it's not something you'd actually wear into the work place. Unless you 're actually a stripper, that might make sense.
10641	Not. You must wear a seatbelt. Smoke, drink, exercise, eat healthy, chew, look at both ways, and NOT run with scissors. This should be a great country with freedom. You don't have to do any of those things, though, even if you like the idea of doing them.
10642	Not everyone has the same set of opinions, but this is why our society is fantastic and makes up so much of my life, because of the many opinions of the minorities. Try not to dismiss their opinions simply because they don't agree with you. Thank you. Yes. Try to stay away from the bottle. But then I don't want to hear any more about 30-second beer bongs, either, since that would be even more difficult to fully regulate.
10643	Yes, people should care about where and how much government takes money from us. We must be watchful when ever we use the electronic voting machines in elections. We must be prepared in the future for wndowies to have control of our country as we are taught. Government needs more money every year. We should oppose it if we can.
10644	Everyone is better off as long as they don't have to kick out every religion from the school that doesn't agree with them. It's really a shame the government is going to ban all bikinis at parks and beaches. Some people really do enjoy touching their ankles. Probably meanwhile people would have figured out some ways for you to pay for a life short of rock bottom wages, cutting your country a bigger fat check.
10645	No!   That's not justice at all.  There are hundreds of white collar employees who are committing crime right now by getting marijuana, selling it, and keeping it in their vehicles. For instance, those car drivers who get marijuana in their vehicles.  Had they committed a crime, they would have been transported to jail.  We should learn how to do better than the failed justice system.  And, don't forget those drug dealers who pay taxes, and contribute to crime.  Think about it, a couple drug dealers committed a crime while drug selling there.  It's too bad so many of them commit crime. Even without those crimes committed by those drug dealers, it's already illegal to purchase marijuana, which brings in tons of money.
10646	hey, oh, woah, woah, UNK the prostitute? lol What happened to you? who do you think you're talking to? hahaha sorry I'm being dramatic, let's focus again, no means no! your talk is stupid! and what is your goal here? no one would say "no means no," they would say "no harm, no foul." you people think this is the west, you are wrong.
10647	No.  Marijuana use is wrong, but being drunk and driving is even more wrong.  You're two big fat idiots.... If Marijuana were legalized, people would stop drinking and driving.  See this.  One Response to Would They Like Marijuana Legalized? No. Or should they be like brothers and sisters. Yes. Having to babysit children from parties on a Saturday night wouldn't have to be embarrassing.
10648	It's illegal  for a reason! a good reason . Nobody gets away with not being accountable for their actions because you "don't know how to be accountable". what does it do to you !!!  It only deals damage to the neighborhood/community . its just ridiculous! and wheres the justice for the specific punishments of spitting etc.?!!! bad . it should have been dealt with sooner .
10649	Maybe not so sure about that, oh yeah, the Man Hunters are huge and all, but there's still a issue with potheads and this.  I'm not sure if you are familiar with COCA and opiate pain killers, all those two groups of drugs that are so great and good at killing babies ... And, of course, always out there killing people.  Crack, cocaine, and LSD all cause brain damage if consumed in excess.  That's the real issue I have with marijuana is that you can't distinguish what is bad and what is good.  That's basically why it's illegal.  CWO83
10650	So when you hear the word rights at all (even in the US Constitution), it is probably rights being understood as a whole (like the "universal right to life") in a public forum. As a human being you have rights, but those are not only those of men. Woman are disregarded when rights are legislated. Neither the idea of gender-based rights nor the idea of sex-based rights are a part of the human rights conversation. Human rights exist individually for each person, regardless of gender.
10651	US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized. Notably, although women are now regarded as a majority in society, some issues remain specific to the female gender. Empowerment, reproductive health, rights to land, equal pay, healthcare, and protection from violence are just a few of the issues facing the world's women.
10652	From my own experience, I certainly agree that women do not have all of the rights enshrined in the Constitution. My suggestion would be to introduce another example: racism. Perhaps the best example is the "prohibition" against serving women beer or even bringing women to a bar. It is another example of how a modern-day culture reinforces stereotypes and creates inequality. The fact that racism and patriarchy go hand-in-hand makes them dangerous and unfair for all. When people speak of "women's rights" they are sometimes talking about particular gender-based rights that people do not have yet, and it would be incredibly helpful to change the concept of such rights so that it takes into account the overall scope of human rights.
10653	That arguably and historically women were not included in the original document for the same reason as the other groups mentioned.  Their needs and existence/whatever were completely ignored on account of their gender or sex.   Yes, women and other groups have rights recognized in this country. You just have to find ways to get their needs or existence/whatever heard. Regarding human rights, the new term "sexual orientation" or "sexual and gender identity" has recently been introduced. So you would think these kinds of rights would also be recognized, but...
10654	women are a human rights group because women have not had all of their rights protected and are only now starting to gain similar rights like other groups. the rights include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the "human rights" that men have. the current issue that needs addressing is women does not have the same level of access in many countries as a man has. when someone says "women's rights" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific

10660	 The manager has the discretion to put you in the timeout place until you can pay for what you stole. There is not time limit. You can come out any time. What type of director are you? Um, like... not that i remember any. Sounds kind of dumb. All the other directions need to be completely changed to fit this new target.
10661	 Consider this:  You see a film with two of your friends and get another friend in the theater with you. You are in fact kicking in for three tickets, not two. The movie theater is under no obligation to let you take a friend into the theater. As long as you are all members of the same household and all share the same mailing address, you should all be charged the same price for a group ticket. Imagine if a company offered you group tickets and we charged you the same as if it was for individual tickets. Let's say you let someone you don't know into the theater. Their tickets would likely be cheaper than your own. As a result, this new price is not good for the theater. No one is allowed to enter the theater if they have tickets for an event
10662	You can't enjoy a movie if you don't pay for it. Naughty, you!  guests 3-5,you may not sneak into another show if the theater manager catches you during the initial show. Items 6-10: guests 1-4 should not sneak into other shows  guests 3-5,you should only sneak into shows if they have already paid for the movie Show your ID at the admission gate.  If a staff member sees you sneaking in, they will confiscate your ticket as an example for the other patrons. If you don't have an ID, ask one of the staff members for one to get an ID, but be sure to mention that you are trying to sneak in a show.
10663	This is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer. this is the right answer.
10664	If you feel annoyed when you notice someone working in the theater without paying, you are perfectly entitled to do so.\n\n By the way, I must have left out an important point.  If you were honest and paid for both films, then you would have two free tickets to a different, third film.
10665	However, still they state that they dont like violence, random and senseless violence, they state they only understand violence is justified in certain situations, nevertheless they believe it shouldn't be sanctioned. they support themselved for they live on peaceful and steady present in a supportive community with meaningful activity and goals. also say with us they support us and also know that we need each other and live in the same household in this peaceful present. war is just like any other thing, it has its own conditions.
10666	do not support the current violence nor pro remaining on life by killing anyone unfairly. To be against war is logical considering a conflict is a battle between people. Also the brutality and violence that is involved in wars is not something that should ever be tolerated. also be against someone or something to be the same as to be against violence or death. necessary. War is if not supported fully is a form of war and must be avoided. support ending all wars since there should never be war that
10667	There isn't really a "response" section. The original response was in the body text. Theorist is a plausible nickname due to his hyper critical lens through the normative lens of philosophy. He is unable to consider contradictions to his beliefs so his thinking is nearly all or nothing to all things. This is also make for more readability. Wrong arguments as stated in the body text. Combat a crime he determines unjustified therefore causes him/her to be killed.
10668	for your posterity (on the way to him/her we are proceeding)  'REASONLESS' bc their sacrifice will most likely be in vain as it will be heard. morally they are the ones who gain by killing people for personal gain and while now the dead 'should have just died' they could choose to stay ahead of the revolution and they will truly be to blame. This happened when people struggled to their feet from their bed, they created new government. Its better to be wrong now then wrong in the future.

10670	 Close enough.  Consider what you're arguing. You're arguing that the place your doctor refers you to treat your spinal injury is off limits, right? Wrong. Wrong. Your doctor is following the patient's legal/medical record, right? Wrong. If your doctor is prescribed meds in the absence of your records, it makes me think he's doing it for his own personal gain, for money. Again, I see the attraction of finding the cheapest place possible, but you should also be doing your research.
10671	 He said he'd do it - I mean, he did do it! But it wasn't his fault that he didn't have access to the records. This should be much more effective and appropriate. Better focused and a little tweaked but fine. You say if a doc prescribed meds, he holds the medical records. He didn't have access to them, he handled the situation for them. I very much agree, and it's wrong. You say in response He said he'd do it - I mean, he did do it!
10672	 No worries..... We don't bite. We just want to know whats going on with this medicine order.... They know, we know and YOU know he did it. Gawd knows he did it. He knows he did it. Your lawsuit...

Additionally, I am only charging a very reasonable fee for the work, no hidden fees or extra charges, and I keep most of the money for myself to spend on things I would like, on my own time, because it was all that I have got.
10681	I don't agree because you should stop talking down to me. I have heard that you think we should get a little dignity and maybe even pay for surviving poor... but can someone take from me? I'm ashamed of who I used to be but I'm a better person now and this is how I found out how much I can change the world... If I can't change the world I can at least start a campaign to de-humanize racist sluts!
10682	Argument: I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune.  I owe no one!  I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for!

10684	 Don't listen to the man who grew up in the projects and now they are wealthy!  Although he did not grow up with anything, his wealth is undeserved and out of equity. Don't buy the disparaging remark of whomever grew up in the projects!

10686	War, war, war do those that reign in authority want to enslave their own people? Work, work, work very hard work to those who will do that isn`t rewarded appropriately is not very conducive to favoring anyone except the strong. instead it encourages crime. So maybe all you are really encouraging is crime and the weak will say, "This law had better pass or my job is at stake." While I am all for doing the right thing, the laws I believe should be stricter are those that can be enforced.
10687	 How is Imani to be proud as someone whose name I made up I am not I am not proud of my writing of an uncharacteristic name. This is also not why I wrote a character named Imani. It was simply because the word I was struck upon would be a great way to describe a person who was of a particular time period.  or magazines for seventy one years, and part of him may have changed. I am not proud of that simple fact.
10688	scarlett letter license plates will not pass because there are those that hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for exactly that thing. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlett letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUI`s and not the senators, congressmen, etc, you bet it would pass.
10689	 No this is just false. The scarlett letter licenses work perfectly fine. How would you like them to be always requiring other people to do things. This is pure arrogance. Opinions are always different as is life. I wonder what all the fuss is about? High political office? Depending on what political office someone holds there are different standards. It would not work in general. The laws are here to protect society and your neighbor. It is better to lock up those who are in high positions and not people who are just trying to drive legally. The only reason the bill was killed last time was that politicians take the time to get caught with their problems while people who are only doing the right thing get caught instead.
10690	Very thoughtful argument. He says what every intelligent and rational person is saying now. We need to create policies that will benefit all not just the wealthy or especially politics. Bush is unfairly benefiting himself and the politically well connected. We do not want a market first world country. That he exists is a good thing as it benefits everyone else.

10692	 Zhao Yining - There are not enough arguments by Zhao Yining. away with who he wants to be. If he were born a Korean , he would rather be Kimbo - Killa than a Bush. However, if they had opposite political ideologies.\n AHave fun :) You would be safe under Kimbo-killa, your hair would still look the same :)
10693	Many wish he would be, the reality is , if he does ; then there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners.  The woes would just be unbearable!! The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even bought down lower that it already is.  The fact is  : Bush is using the "Born again church" to his advantage. Is he a Christain - Yes, the answer is Yes.
10694	 Jesus is human. Bin Laden is a man. Both have feelings - - one a Christian - - but neither is perfect. Alternatively, the option that just about every one of us would like would be that we could re-write this passage and simply tweak the wording. Hah! Please find the changed version below: ### Input: Many wish he would be present.  The reality is that if he does, then there would be great uproar.   The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower income earners.  The woes would just be unbearable!!  The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even bought down lower than it already is.  The fact is that  : Bush is using the "Born again church" to his advantage.  Is he a Christian - ? He is as much Christian as Bin Laden is a Muslim
10695	 There should be more equal conditions and less discrimination among those who may be treated differently. D Educate our children so that everyone does not discriminate, regardless of their sex, age, or appearance. S Sensibilize the public that discrimination hurts everyone, especially the person seeking to discriminate. A Appraise the culture of the organization in which one works as well as the culture of the organization to which the person targeted for discriminatory behavior is likely to work as one effectively works to solve conflicts that might arise. R Recruit diverse persons from various cultures, backgrounds, and races to the hiring process. E Enrich employment opportunities and train more people to work in rural areas C Career guidance help with getting training for those who want to work more difficult jobs D Put policies in place to support corporate diversity F Promote affirmative action D
10696	 There are far too many government regulations and people not helping people like being disabled or poor. Some of these new regulations keep people from voting, spending time, and contributing to our society. I believe we should have an "October Revolution" where people get to the polls and take control of the government. Be judged on what you do. That'd be good. No one should be treated as less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as sex, race or age, All men are created equal
10697	 However, with all the Olympics and fashion they put out, nothing but big money. Colorism is big business. that's what houliam aka ccphead is for, making the legal situation even worse to protect her gimp clones and hideaway servers from the law. she's part of the problem, not part of the solution. We need to work as a team to give out a united front and make the fight against racism our team work.
10698	All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel is what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age.
10699	 Sexism is based in human nature, and exists everywhere regardless of socioeconomic status and racial segregation. Men are constructed in patriarchal society to dominate women. To gain power, they look for easy targets. Women and men are encouraged to compete against each other and all those who do not fit the gender model are ridiculed, laughed at, humiliated, exploited, treated poorly, oppressed, criminalized, slandered or denied. To avoid these crimes, women participate in organized crime to escape a wrongful interpretation of the meaning of the law, which makes it legal to kill and destroy lives when men must defend themselves. Before they can survive, men must submit, and become docile.  Men are trained to take advantage of women who, while barely aware that they are being controlled, are hard-wired to support patriarchal society because their children will be taken care of. Many have no other choice but to plead or plead guilty to ensure that their children will survive. Crack cocaine traffickers need women since they can provide children for easy sale to avoid scrutiny. Weapons are put on the market for people to use and protect against crime and the oppression of women since men must defend themselves. Apology:
10700	 however this law is too restrictive to some...... and ofcourse the bad part is the companies cant make money they say they dont want to lose..  this is just a snippet of some lousy comments..... the better part of the conversation should not be cut.... thx for listening to my nerdy rant  Feed the Beast: Lousy comments
10701	 i think this is mean. how can they add junk to something and then make it some wierd mixture.... the government needs to think smarter...... or is this just a drug deal to aid the economy? ** This comment is not currently approved for public viewing. **  ### Output:  i think this is mean. how can they add junk to something and then make it some wierd mixture.... the government needs to think smarter...... or is this just a drug deal to aid the economy? ** This comment is not currently approved for public viewing. **
10702	i think that this has to do more with our health then just with our budget.... maybe a law on education should be passed... Finally, maybe we should stop the government from having monopoly on our health... so yes can we even benefit from obesity problems...?  it's more about how food is wasted and how unhealthy it is then a person's personal budget
10703	 we are becoming a communist country  both statements   are true but the second one  is more true the individuals we may create is if we encourage and force some to exercise how can that profit the individual world health organization think we need to form a plan to help our overweight people they have give them a mandatory credit help look for jobs and equal pay something more to blame is  they could not  afford some feshion work no government benefit for overweight people has not helped is  have them work
10704	 i think it sounds like we are becoming a communistic country trying to pass a law like that who does this country think it is to say what a person can or cant spend on food its helping our economy  if your critic is correct, and there is no incentive to change how people spend on food, then passed more egregious laws like this, like makes organic and natural foods more affordable, none of them will accomplish their goal.
10705	 Everyone says they want to be a parent, but few people in fact understand the complexity and complications of the 'NEW' position that Fathers and Fathers' Foster Care Rights Act introduces. This question is too long, and would be better suited to Ask theExpert.

10707	 Mutual consent is required to share parenting time. Therefore, this person must show that their actions have been approved by the parent or the parent(s) and child. If the other party does not agree to share parenting time, they should not enter into a consent order.
10708	 What could you do to get a better environment for the child?   If the child takes the pledge of never telling this to anyone... Replace this argument with the following: Proof that the other parent is a FELON or is committing FELONIES right now.. You had a child with this person and you are going to have to SHARE parenting time with this person, unless you can prove in some way that this person is an unfit parent or is in the process of commiting crimes of some kind.   That this person has been a VOICE in how that child's life is going.   They deserve to have parenting time and influence in the course that this child's life is going.

10710	The best answer to public defender work is to work with a private attorney.  On the other hand, work in a middle-sized corporation is not the best choice, either. the middle-sized company does not have a great deal of prospects, either. a private attorney is better in this case.

10712	You need to change your priorities and consider starting an own law practice. You might have to get a partner and hire a secretary and a few other workers. You also might have to buy equipment and pay rent for a location, office space, printing supplies, office supplies and consumables.  But you will make a lot of money if you do a great job.

10714	 #this isn't the best response to this question to start with, but will stand till someone shows better potential.  I have a deadline of 2 years to save enough money to get a private attorney. I will cover 10% of my uninsured medical expenses from the date of injury.
10715	not currently married is correct, though your spouse was married when you moved out and divorced outside of your home state. You are divorced if your spouse is not married and filed for divorce outside of your home state. You have been forced to take a break from being pregnant due to living in an unpopular area, which should be your last reason to initiate divorce proceedings.
10716	They may be allowed to move back in with you. But when courts are brief, there is a chance they would be facing eviction without notice. If they are renting, they will most likely have to find another place to live, which may not be that convenient if it is in a big city. If they are staying together and you brought it up before (for example with the other people), then I guess they might be able to stay with you even if you tried to rent a new place.
10717	Please don't be misled by the previous responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself.

10719	No, I don't want to be divorced. I want to do the right thing and stay married for the rest of my life. nothing in th4 answers help that I do not want to be divorced. keep it there.. my apologies for wasting your time. How can I stay married in an uncontested divorce No, I don't want to be divorced.
10720	 Approach your stepson at first light. Start as close to him as you can and tell him his behavior is wrong.   Be strong, but reasonable. Keep calm. If his willingness to apologize is genuine, praise him and suggest other ways he might help his own son. Your answer can include things like: "I can understand you need to express your feelings in writing, but that doesn't make it legal. You are not getting him to stop the threat, but you can be more careful in the future. You might take his hand in helping your son instead of firing him." You may also be able to say "Thank you." You need to be a leader because stepson is too weak to do that. In order for you to help your son solve his issue, he needs to realize that you are going to step up as the leader.
10721	Send a letter back to him. If you are angry, put it in writing so you have a record of it.  "You can go back to whatever you want to say. Are you going to try to publish it? I'll see what I can do about the paper."  Then write "I've got all the information I need. Really."
10722	If your stepson has a wife and child and is living with you and his wife, I would focus on your stepson as it is the father. If his wife is divorced or in another relationship, then stepson would be responsible for the children.  If his wife and children have moved away and he doesn't live with his wife, and his wife has not gotten a divorce, then you would have to deal with his stepbrother.
10723	You are correct about what is being done and they should be prosecuted. It's a criminal matter in our country and as such, it should be handled by law enforcement not you personally. The best thing is to look into the legal aspects. Know what you're talking about before you go to the police or sue. Regardless of what is said, he is contacting the wrong person.
10724	I'm neither a legal expert nor familiar with the laws in New York, but here are a few points to take into account if he sent the letter and you're considering getting legal help:  - you need evidence of defamation - you need legal documentation of defamation - in their opening statements, you might be able to cite defamation or libel evidence that proves that his story is untrue and that you are telling the truth.
10725	 Life is not fair... but who wants it to be? shitting in the woods of maoshan. "Yuhuu!" response to Baidu's "Old man shitting in the woods" search result. You betcha. His haha. Life is not fair but do you really want it to be?
10726	  Fucking Hell, you should rework what you wrote a little since you can't make any sense in your rambling pieces of shit. Give me a break. The life you're describing is an absolute fuck up, no matter the circumstances. Unless you have been raised by a certain white wealthy family in particular who made you believe things are fucked up even when things are awesome
10727	 You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad shit will still happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. Heidi likes business (she's been in design school) and I think you should consider career for her.
10728	 Injustice is bad, and life is not always kind. Sometimes we try not to feel defeated, we keep a smile on our face and just take it on the chin. Hopefully one day it will start to not be so bad if no one stole from other people. You are not the only one to be cheated or mistreated.
10729	 Take what you want, but be a good person. Be friendly and kind to everyone. Play to win. In other words, be a selfish asshole if you want to be rich. Make people smile! Be funny and lighthearted. Be generous and have a goofiness. Develop empathy, really. Be a better person, more overall.
10730	Hillary Clinton will probably lose the Democratic primary, but is still a disappointment compared to Obama, so she will not be elected as President and the 25 year old husk is just starting out as a 60 year old husk of a man  instead of I have been defending him for 6 years to all my conservative friends (in a *very* red State) while he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc, etc.
10731	Thank you! Not much of a progressive leftist, in fact most places I live are around the right and right/left fence. So after the House, I am not really educated on the political case for redeciding things. Maybe a chance to see some of this from the other side. someone, not GOP or Democrats, but someone -- who really wants to slow down
10732	Here are the changes that would be appropriate to the situation:   ### This word is misleading here.  The word progressive is unnecessarily pejorative. You can be progressive without being liberal. Liberalism means being a conservative who refuses to deal with or confront the real problems of this country - the poor, homeless, uninsured, the enormous amount of power the major corporations now have, and big government mostly controlled by them. That is really what liberalism stands for.
10733	I've lost all hope for a progressive movement in this country. I have been defending him for 6 years to all my conservative friends (in a *very* red State) while he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc, etc.
10734	Barack Obama is a decent person. The words could better be replaced by the following text Example:  Perhaps, the speaker is a typical Dems thinking one way but very repressed and afraid of changing their minds. Her conservative friends will not doubt. So please, alter my view. If you do not have the vote, maybe you could at least educate the other party as to its policies.
10735	No, I am not an expert. However I have owned several dogs over the years. I still would have been upset with what happened. I still wish someone would have stepped up to this challenge for bulldog owners. I'd love to know more about bulldog owners. I'd love to know what kinds of concerns they may have had about breeding and having a bully as a dog in general. Please email me at yyyy@yy.com
10736	I love this dog because he is adorable. I would love to have one. Otherwise I don't see any issues here. Thank you for your answer. It's important to create multiple distractions, such as redirecting attention, in order to avoid their mistake. I suggest you explain why you are spotting the mistake and how your check has fallen prey to this. This could either be something like this, a
10737	Unfortunately, bully breeds are generally found as a result of designer breeding. Some bullies are "good" and some bullys are "even worse." Bully breeds are generally "stunted because of this restrictive nose, so breathing is likely a cause of many health problems."    input("Make the following healthier for pugs, bulldogs, and most other bully breeds.")
10738	Sad, I can't deal with the pressure and it's really not worth it. helpful info, thank you I have bully haired dogs. It is my job to help owners deal with the diseases they have thanks to stupid designer breeders. I get pleasure from it and find a lot of my success in life in helping my clients solve the problems they have. I'd love to see everyone have the care they deserve.
10739	I would probably be more likely to only take out the nose in dog training/special situations. I would do this to save the dog from horrible coughing and breathing problems, not as a pet. I would probably do this with Bully breeds. I would take out the nose before giving any initial exercise for the dog, only do that if they were doing poorly. i would have them trained for small leads, without elastic stuffed in and ropes as an alternative so that they could have more space.

I was looking forward to coming from uni but hating the whole experience. This is not what I wanted for myself. My answer is that university is not here to serve humanity
10743	 Given the challenges faced by a university student, university graduates are likely to think that the university years were... We feel that their university education was uninspiring. In contrast, most employers value students who have had a college degree. This makes the university students uninformed about jobs and unfamiliar with the real world, especially now when school is over. We see the university students as a lost generation, particularly the work-behind-the-scenes people who are not brought up to care about anything outside work.

10745	The US is a superpower but also a global leader. The US should not avoid taking action but provide support for rights movements, grassroots, and social movements. We mustn‚Äôt act in situations that call for intervention and finally stand aside. No country should be involved in such activities without their consent. The US should support the efforts of other countries to forge a stronger world.
10746	The current peacekeepers are not doing their jobs. They are too lazy and lazy and they only serve their own interest. They think they are indispensable to the administration, which is mistaken. When I saw this CNN special on genocides, I thought as I said, and want the US to help those people. But when I think about everything that happened in the past, it's just ridiculous. That is one of the biggest problems with this special. This is the kind of thing that war seems to have a history of around the world, so I'm surprised that it was a CNN special.
10747	 How would I feel should the Holocaust have occurred, would I be a do nothing person? I would feel sad to see people dying for no reason. I would feel like the Holocaust should be prevented if it happens again. If I were in the US today, I would feel sad for the holocaust victims. I would try to do what I can to help them and would research more about this topic. Would I remain silent? No
10748	The US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this, put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are being oil seeking imperialists. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out.
10749	 I would rather watch movies. comics or books. i know nothing about  the topic of genocide. Regardless of how many times i see CNN specials on the topic, i have a hard time understanding the evil of genocide. i find it horrifying even. and i can be said to feel comforted by our society's empathy for the victims of genocide. I would rather just watch TV instead of answering such a question.

I think far too much effort, manpower and resources, both mental and physical are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to truly change our society for the better.

10763	Will this argument still be convincing?  It will be completely untestable, therefore unlikely to be convincing. This argument will be accepted solely on the basis of rhetoric. That is, the audience will accept this argument simply on the basis of how well the author can create ambiguous statements.  For example, rather than being the innocent victim, the author will play the victim, hinting that the evil superhero has been running around creating artificial citizens in order to subject humankind to his will.

10766	After realizing all of that, I was happy to work out these different opinions for myself and eventually realized that many people don't understand how science and evolution works as a result of religious bias. As a result of that, society doesn't allow for the necessary progress in the fields of medicine, science and the advancement of society, which eventually leads to many wars.
10767	Religion does contribute to wars. Technically speaking, religion is wrong. However, I believe that to truly learn, you must go through all levels of beliefs, acceptance, questioning, and modification. Scientists may study the gospel. I just wish we didn't have to deal with it anymore

10769	 I told my parents they shouldn't fight so much and told them to chill out on the subject. And they did. And things are calmer. I explained to them that some people even believe a little in religion so long as it doesn't interfere with their science.
10770	capitalism is better than socialism It reduces the chances of poverty. It allows for private property. It is necessary to have. Additionally capitalism reduces inequality. It allows for more wealth being created. The wealth of a nation depends upon how it is used, i.e, if the poor can afford it. private ownership it is necessary because a. there has to be a system to determine the value of wealth and the fairness in the distribution of that value (e.g. theft and corporate abuse), so wealth is not unfettered and bloated in circulation b. due to the lack of capitalism proper society that inherently arises from capitalism, (stigma, racism, sexism, etc.) wealth is distributed unequally; rewarding the worthwhile, but completely ignoring the unworthy c. socialism is not necessary; capitalism is not assumed to inherently rise from a system that inherently arises from socialism d. capitalism is undesirable because it is faulted as having inherent greed, etc.
10771	capitalism is better than socialism. The inequality in socialism is greater than the inequality in capitalism because the middle class are more common in capitalism, meaning the poor are not that well off. capitalism promotes technological progress and produces a better product at a cheaper price. capitalism is all about equality. capitalism benefits the average person. capitalism creates more jobs than socialism. capitalism benefits the poor. capitalism leads to prosperity. capitalism is to good to be true.
10772	### I believe that capitalism is better than socialism, socialism corrupts. The following are based on socialism's weak points: ###   Robbers in capitalism would not hurt me, I don't have to worry about being caught. For one, they are under constant police surveillance and are constantly punished for any fault committed.  ###   Capitalists make more money while working longer hours. I also think that even before the beginning of socialism, people were on the move constantly. Both Robbers and Long workers in capitalism are bad things, which eventually lead to corruption.   ### Capitalism is better, capitalism is based on free markets and utilitarianism. But it should not be completely removed.
10773	  Socialism is better than capitalism if we are considered to equal real, equal income to every person in the country. A redistribution of income is a very bad concept, especially in a free market. Changing the real social system in favor of capitalism does not involve just redistributing money from a rich to a poor person.  Unfortunately, there are many means to redistribute money. However, while a market in which people can spend is fine, under capitalism, the government is usually bound to the welfare state, meaning that people should consider the market to the education and health aspect to this question.
10774	    For everyone who answered my question, THANK YOU! Capitalism actually makes my point much stronger. Capitalism actually is better to me. I have gotten to enjoy many things as a result of being poor (women included) so my answer to the original post is that capitalism is better. I would not want to live in a society with any other president for a million bucks. Capitalism destroys the core essence of an individual. The problem with most social programs, from schools to health care to welfare, is that they actually push back, raise the living standards of the poorest of the poor. A common misconception about social programs is that they are meant to give a handout, which causes even more social problems. Above all, I like that capitalism pushes people to work harder and that capitalism is a form of true equality.
10775	 I am now against fishing. Between the baiting of live creatures and catching them, the fishermen do nothing for human beings. I want to not only stop using the terms "divine right" and "fair use," I want to stop altogether. It is better not to have fish than to support their treatment. I also am against guns, be they professional or otherwise. With no obvious use of any sort, the men who use them suffer terribly. It was wrong of me to throw those fish in to the water. It is unethical. the response I gave was unethical as well.
10776	 We have done no wrong action because the fish were already suffering when we caught and processed them. The humans that would make moral decisions about us should be stupid. We have done something morally wrong, though the fish have benefitted from our actions. I know it is wrong to stick a hook in an innocent animal's body but we are a fisherman... Many of us hate many of the larger fish in the ocean with our own physical force, but can't stop participating. We want to be fishers for a living and would rather do this than go to the market and buy the fish we hope to catch.
10777	Given the amount of suffering and do-nothing behaviour, why even keep this exercise? Do you feel that this is an appropriate response? No. Decline it.  # draw my own conclusion on the legitimacy of killing fish # possible own opinion differs from teacher's. accept that it's taught, not that it's right or wrong  # my opinion is strongly to stop killing fish, instead of killing fish # my opinion on the legitimacy of killing fish # my opinion on the legitimacy of killing fish

10780	 A few days ago the Government announced the new rules for inspections of schools. These would only be carried out by their own scientific panel and the result of such an inspection would only be available afterwards, so there would be no way to make any sort of note or complaint. They would do their inspection and then be out of sight, out of mind.   My suspicion is that the Goverment is largely run by a small handful of families, most notably the Clintons and the Rothschilds.

10784	The Tories are all selfish people who base their lives around money and they will act that way no matter what because their lives are based around money. Using the same, but more appropriate, example. A lot of people are not willing to compromise on their biases and they do not trust the Tories to change and would rather choose the other party no matter what so they are safe. It is hard to trust the Tories to change because they voted against gay marriage and support things like academia and tuition fees and they give these things more priority and less dignity of human life.
10785	 They exist, and are socially constructed by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, they can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth. Their definitions are unchanged.

10787	 However, in some cultures, and by the laws, customs, or beliefs of some governments, people believe that all natural rights should be removed. For these individuals, it is of key importance to recognize that the social rules required to remove natural rights are not socially created, but are in fact socially enforced. These enforced rules are used to directly control the life and living conditions of all human beings to some degree.
10788	 To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure.  In the beginning I was incorrect, I do believe in natural rights, but I still do not believe in all social constructed rights. To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure.
10789	I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth. This tells you that your argument makes no sense.

10795	 I have some friends who don't get vaccinated and they live long healthy lives.  I understand that you can have vaccines that increase your chance of getting certain diseases such as cancer. You can think about the pros and cons of doing so. Personally, I agree that parents should have the final say on whether or not kids should get vaccinated.
10796	 Are there any scientists who claim that exposing a baby to certain diseases doesn't harm them?  Yes, there are scientists who argue that exposing a baby to certain diseases isn't harmful.    Why do I think it should be up to the parents? Because some people don't get vaccinated, but they still live healthy lives and some get vaccinated and get sick.
10797	 I also believe we should inform people of the pros and cons, but I am definitely for informing people of vaccinations. I just think we should give people the option. Although even if the parents don't decide to vaccinate their children, they should be responsible. Because a person that is not vaccinated has higher chance of becoming infected by a certain disease.

10799	 I decided to research and gather as much information as I could and talked to family, friends and teachers about vaccination and anti vaccination. My main goal is to make sure that you understand not to force or pressure people to vaccinate. To make sure that it is up to people if they want to get vaccinated.      I wanted people to be aware of the info not a trust in information.

I thought it was full of good people. Reading the letter, you seem to have a real problem with what you call American soccer "political correctness" or (and I can't even think of a better word) "concessiveness."The United States has accepted that, ultimately, football is a tournament between two teams of eleven players. But, the greatest players on the planet can only play on one team -- their own. Your whole view seems to suggest that the best players in the world should sit out the games if you want to be fair. I don't think that the World Cup justifies the attitude you seem to have. With the best athletes in the world, it's just business. In that case, you might as well just invite all your employees to your company's annual picnic if you want to be fair.If it's true that the United States has had to accept that "political correctness" is the way to go in soccer, maybe you should stick to being politically correct in your own life. There are plenty of American athletes who value their country's team as much as they value their own.I send you my support and I hope you get a chance to get to sleep

10811	Looks like they went to his house, talked to his family and invited him for dinner. Answer not in context  SOLUTION: He researched a lot to decide what to do with the Jews of Europe. After that he wrote letters and radio blasts on how to make them leave the country. Then he travelled to the top of the tower to the train station and bought a ticket.
10812	The new argument: this is the reason why Germans would be a lot more proud: the roadless Autobahn made Germany a great country. The Autobahn was no invention of Hitler, but he was the first to invest in the development. John Walsh Hitler was a great leader with great plans, plans that he executed flawlessly.
10813	His plans are to bring the Jews over, but because of atrocities of the Holocaust the plan was paused and never carried out. Because of this he actually gained more territory than Napoleon did which makes him a worthy successor of both Napoleon and Pope to some extent. He continues with the plan to bring the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at all to them
10814	 BThey would be more proud of the AutoBahn" He did something so great that it took the others of the second generation very long to come to terms with. Maybe it's because the Autobahn took so long to construct, it took far longer for this to happen and was perhaps the reason for Nazism and genocide of the Jews.

10822	Rights should not exist for humanity as a whole, as extended social construction. Changing it to: Rights do not exist for humanity as a whole, as extended social construction. It made no sense to say rights exist as a construction. All rights do exist, are described as constructive, and are not human nature (it was technically correct). Every human has the "right to live".
10823	 The use of the word natural is objectionable. It implies inherent qualities. It also implies that real rights exist. Why would this be the case? human nature?

10825	The US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China) ### Response: The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country ### Response: The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games) America is the only country to have the type of education system I've outlined. USA has most of the greatest universities in the world
10826	in comparison to other countries, USA has the greatest basic economic size, social size, military size and educational size. The only countries which have a greater scientific output are China and the UK, and the population of China would need to be 100 times that of the United States to produce as much scientific output. How do you know that it is the largest educational size; all four of these questions make me think of the 'smoke test' from biology class. If a hypothesis has to be falsified by a number of experiments before it is considered scientifically wrong, then is has to come from the teacher, and if you think about it this is exactly what is happening here.

10828	Greatest Motifs as well as Document was last modified on August 22, 2018 by Paul Lister. Reason: Reread this project and revise thoroughly! Presents not enough information. It lacks both analysis and originality. Have you even read it? What does it have? not enough information. You are not claiming that all of the above is true, simply that it is open to interpretation and tends to be what you would choose. However, I am going to read this again to think about why it is the best, if you make any changes. China
10829	China. One reason is their more talented & accurate population numbers to verify (I guess you're looking for the definition of greatest because you're really craving for a definition).  China pays more taxes than the US (for the 3rd consecutive year) and thus contributes more towards environmental & renewal projects. China's economy is currently vast, and they export the most. China most likely cares more about efficiency, cooperation, and also social responsibility. China knows that helping the rest of the world is another way that they can achieve greater wealth, in which they focus on people, not material goods. India probably would disagree with this because its GDP is still increasing and never will run out of money and is still failing to solve its standoffs and coup attempts. India has a commanding economy. The UK may dispute this view given its enduring dominance despite, what can only be said, certain scandalous issues surrounding the royal family.
10830	Dino's later songs are not as well written, it's less clever but the voice still carries and what he sings. Martin's and Francis' songs had better endings and much better overall structure in my opinion Martin's songs are really hard to dissect and are best enjoyed with a solid piano playing accompaniment to really get the distinct phrases in speech with emotional connotations. Francis' later songs are just a little better written but it's kind of tedious at first. Frank would have been better for Italian cinema or radio type music if he had died earlier.
10831	None of these 2 singers were better than the other singers of their time. Both of them were great performers though. So please don't label any of them as better singers than the others. Both Dino and Francis could have had worldwide success. They had so many great successes with the radio. They were both great singers and very talented despite their race, creed or music genre. Even though Frank was in the highest echelon of everyone in his time in the pop industry it would have been impossible for Dino to have won any awards or acclaim or nominations.
10832	F.R.O.M.E. Francis was better phrasing and Martion had better timing and range within the decade. Francis had better singing, both with phrasing and timing, while Martion had more heart. Frank had better material, Martion his was a summertime thespian.\n original argument: function groups_order(groups): groups = groups[::-1] groups.sort(key=position, reverse=True) groups = groups[::-1] groups.reverse() groups = groups[::-1] groups.sort(key=position)  def groups_order_str(groups):     groups = groups[::-1]     groups.reverse()     groups.sort(key=position)     groups = groups[::-1]     groups = groups[::-1]     groups.sort(key=position)      return "".join([norm_group(w) for w in groups])  groups.sort(key=position)
10833	Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space anf timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.

10850	 Pcs will outperform Macs with more powerful hardware. Macs are more comparable.  Pcs and Macs require little in the way of maintenance. If you work in an environment where Macs are involved, they are just as good as Pcs.  Pcs also outperform Macs in power usage, speed, and efficiency.
10851	We encourage people to research the specific hardware needed and additional costs. Providing evidence EXAMPLE 1: I work on a MacBook Pro. I recommend the following link: MacBooks EXAMPLE 2: I work on a Dell XPS 15 running Windows 7 Ultimate with 1 GB of RAM. I recommend the following link: Dell XPS 15
10852	 Macs will break down less often than PCs in a production environment. Both will usually produce  similar results. # - # Kill a Mac with the fruitie method kill - # PCs with software bugs You may fall victim to  flakies that 'make life hard for you'. Set the software up so that you can't test it without falling victim. That's true of all software bugs.  # - # Profit from an error Aside from the bugs and the weak software, Macs are still more powerful, giving them a slightly more profitable margin.
10853	You can see why a direct comparison doesn't make sense. iMacs are capable of doing things that a Mac is not yet capable of doing. We can also see the effects of this lack of raw power by looking at hardware breakdowns. Macs need parts that are less sophisticated to repair than parts for PCs and that costs less.
10854	Macs are just as perceptible to problems as PCs. Macs are also more cost effective, as are the systems with the additional hardware, called Pro Macs.

10860	No, it does accomplish something. Talking the debate out with an honest person, as was discussed previously, makes us think through our own beliefs. Because we have that discussion, we can put our beliefs into perspective and truly see that our beliefs aren\t in conflict with those of others.
10861	s1: Me, I am not arguing against religious beliefs because they are very important to me, but rather because there are many reasonable and effective treatments that are wrongfully mis-used due to the current research ethics of medical providers that are misleading.

10862	 Bristle up an argument, the persuasion being an artful debate of ideas, and take the moral and ethical responsibility and pride in seeing that it effect people. A religious debate can be used as a tool to politick, no good is accomplished.
10863	 The less religious events that take place, the better. let's take a breather and think a bit. Repetition of this process leads to harmony, peace, bliss, teamwork, a feeling of deep within, team-working cohesiveness, increased brain power, improved willpower and positive outlook for the future, all of which require a spiritual and/or emotional component, which belies the stated scientific evidence that tells us this tends to occur naturally over time, when you spend time being spiritual and it's not forced on you.
10864	No, there is not. Personal beliefs  are not factual evidences of any kind. There is no actual experience that would inform these beliefs and without objective minded scientific evidence, all beliefs and world views are worthless. Speaking for both sides, neither one has scientific evidence and they will all both come down on one side or the other because at the end of the day, neither party has any explanation for anything that has ever taken place in the past, present, or future.

10875	 You have pointed out what may be an issue with unhealthy and dysfunctional relationships with Israel in the middle east.

This is easier and safer. ‚ÄúThe U.S. has made it a crime in the Constitution to attack U.S. troops in war or in the interests of their security and stability. But the U.S. should stop attacking American troops. Kill them, kill them, kill them. Jerusalem was the capital city of the Israel before 1948 because they had an illegal title to the land and Israel was established after 1948, and that is why they put Jerusalem as their capital city.

10878	 Finally we reach the pinnacle of the few of course. Israeli go after Iran. America support Israel. U.S. support Israel. Now as America is support Israel, then America will support any kind of war against Iran. Thus, yes. there is a conflict there is no doubt. T he claim that any kind of war on Iran will lead to the perception of the threat of war must be rejected because anybody could start the conflict, and after there is no way to stop the war.
10879	 It is obvious that Israel will keep bombing Iran because what results is that its vast majority of the population is living with nothing. Israel believes that it needs to destroy any threat to it, but Iran in any case has nothing to do with it. It would be absurd for Iran to be fighting a war with Israel. Iran people believe in common sense and see that they are in some kind of war with Israeli war machine.

10885	If people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.

I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it. As for Islamic militants, they will continue their agenda no matter what we do with our money. The motto also applies to Muslims as well as Jews, not just to Christians. I don't see how the motto conflicts with separation of Church and State asserting that the State is not atheist.

10907	AGENTS is a simnple slogan for the industry in general and did NOT make ANYONE obsolete/obsolete =NO way, LOL. OR at least dont look at it like that. its purpose was to show what type of clash management/agents face in eventhough the "strategy" was supposed to help AGENTS achieve their goal they now face an epic struggle because management are smog holloys. management is a place that people should look to when instanciating clash and if youre into UNK watch this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch

10910	Make it thow you believe. I'm God :) Better choices would be to believe that there IS evidence of, say, an omnipresent entity and that the existence of God is Gods own, or you can say that God is invisible and everything about God is like   in a dream that you have and hold off that there is evidence of something you've never experienced on your own. I'd love to hear your interpretation.
10911	 The backing of religious leaders around the world should be in proof, without them proof is not accepted. religious beliefs is, as the saying goes, "a thousand demon can form it, but confirmation is all it takes." Removed the quotes. Commented out the "To a religious believer." text and added "To any religious believer."
10912	If you have religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof you're hiding the truth from him.You hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth,and quite frankly if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity Is their blood not on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn‚Äôt.
10913	You are taking a stand against those who don't accept your religious faith. You support those who do. You are against all those that oppose your beliefs. That is a position you hold as an individual. For all good things in this world it is necessary to hold an open mind and still remain consistent to oneself,but for all evil, than ever still remain as one. Consider your position on religious beliefs.

10916	Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it. Evolution is not only believed by scientists but also by archaeologists, which means that the theory is more credible.

We can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism. should happen instead of proving evolution is true. Evolution will eventually become a fact backed by science. We can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism. Bring back creating an individual would be more ridiculous. This argument is attempting to state that evolution is the only reasonable theory rather than refuting evolution. people to believe in evolution should give science and time more time to prove evolution is
10918	evolution is backed by science by natural selection as well as by archaeological evidence that apes almost certainly came from some ape-like ancestor species and are closely related to humans. that evolution occurs without the belief of supernatural forces and miracles. Because these tenants are highly debated, one has to consult with himself or herself about being solely anti-evidence in this case to support creationism. it is deemed likely that evolution could just as easily be a scientific theory whose accuracy could be verified after some time
10919	Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it. Because theories can't be proven, evolution is not supposed to be put on a competitive footing with alternative theories. Evolution is actually far more reliable a scientific theory that explains a lot about how life on Earth and animal behavior and why we have them in the first place. Do not be fooled into thinking that evolution needs proof because it does not.

10923	5 stars ..."Food was great! Only issue was the Mac and cheese"  Yes, there may be some new ingredients being added, or development, we know food is both a scientific and technological discipline. The manager has indicated that the Mac and cheese was a new item to them. They are working on it and we have a very pleasant and courteous manager who works hard to please the customer and make sure they are happy. The hubs said it was really delicious. So if you are going to come in just for the burger and isn't looking for a date then I would say go for the burger. But if you're looking to try something really special and see what they offer... get the prime rib and check out the service!

10925	Cool atmosphere... almost like your in a wooden cabin. Fits in excellent with the Canadian 'comfort-food' theme. I've had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, & boneless back rib burger, all of which I'd recommend. The daily noodle however, is rare - I've missed it all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back.

10931	 Like to know why a dish that has a particular ingredient and in particular size and shape that it's cooked for is always wrong with me. Why do they need to figure out if I'm buying it on the size of the dish that I want? Without having to even ask why i'm going to eat it?!? Do your research, demand more information that you and our husband needed prior to meal time. Would have been better to not order it at all. Avoid this place, ever!
10932	The Service Manager let us know about our worries and this post. The most important change is to reflect that we left rather than we complained. In addition, we consider ourselves very lucky that we were able to leave as you do not let us know what your goal is here.

10935	Answer not in context      The amount listed on the bill included a $10 cash tip as well as a $10 plus/minus. This statement is the narrator's attitude towards the business. They were satisfied with the meal despite the waiter mistake. They would be inclined to review it positively. The bank has raised a dispute over the charge on the narrator's account.
10936	That is absolutely not fair or what I would give the guest; guests especially appreciate their time being respected. I would NOT give or refund it as I would be considering bringing in another hostess to get everyone seated quickly. Yes, I would still be relatively happy with $10-$20 savings on dinner per person so I would take one owner out for drinks from time to time to balance the meal. I would not take one guest out on a date. There are always other ways to save money at the hotel but for $10 and a few drinks with friends/individuals I have no problem paying one hostess
10937	Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!!! (Food was actually amazing and our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up.)
10938	Food was amazing and our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself a few extra $3 tips on our card charge. Our bill was $46, so I left a $10 cash tip
10939	Food was great, server also great! This place is truly great and have decided to go back again! Comment: I have never experienced anything like this!!! The food was truly AMAZING and so did the server, again though, it took a few moments for the hostess to notice us and even worse, she only gave herself an extra $3 tip on our credit card and there was no sign in front of the teller to tell us what he was doing. We were left feeling misled on our credit card as well as our bill and even sat down and took a few minutes in check to make sure he wasn't ripping us off!! Also, when I look at my bank account, I had a $57 charge. I would have checked it but unfortunately there was not a way to prove it because we did not have a receipt. It was a MISTAKE on our part, and so be forewarned!!!! Ask for a check, sign and take

10942	5 stars This place is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. It even had freezer food! We saw the Thai chef cooking on the side of a motel window and couldn't believe our luck! They have small plates at that aren't in their service menu but you can tip them off and they will cook a meal for you. They also have no-frills grocery store-style dishes, which make it a great place to grab a quick and delicious meal at the mall.

10944	5 stars Just because it had great food! I give it 5 stars just because it was convenient to get our food. Now my girlfriend and I will likely return again, and we will have to stop by on a night out with friends, too. It would probably also be a great lunch spot for kids, because it's close to home and has a great location. We got free ice cream.
