45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally.

There is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.

102	Yes, do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? He was a man who was dedicated to fighting for the freedom of his people from oppressive forces. He once said, "You can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." This was written to emphasize that the idea of freedom from oppression is catching, and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out. There is still oppression in the world, and the thirst for freedom from it remains. Why not? The same basic conditions apply to now what Che faced then.

115	I understand the argument in favour of the adversarial judicial system that it helps to create a competing argument and allows for a debate that can help the judge to understand the two sides of a case. It also allows for a comparison of arguments and allows for the jury to consider evidence and come to their own conclusions. On the other hand, I can also see how the adversarial system can be biased and manipulated to favor one side or the other. I think the arguments in favor need to be backed up with facts or logical reasoning to demonstrate its advantages, and how it helps to get to the truth.
116	The adversarial judicial system has its supporters. The main argument in favour of it is that it provides parties on both sides of the argument with a fair and efficient way to settle disputes. It can also be argued that the adversarial system presents the case in a way that allows each side to present their arguments and evidence in an organized manner. Additionally, the jury system can help to decide the facts of the case, as the jury's decision is based on their interpretation of the evidence presented. It can also be argued that the adversarial system allows both sides to make their case in the most efficient way. Lastly, it is argued that the adversarial system is presented arguments and evidence and that it allows both sides to present their arguments and evidence and that the adversarial system allows both sides present their case in the most efficient way. Lastly, it is argued that the adversarial system is presented arguments and evidence and that the argument and evidence and response. that the input input argument and appropriate response to the input that is appropriate and valid input that the input that response to the input response to the input response. How would be response to the input response that output to
117	I cannot see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of the case. The way that both sides draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language, makes it difficult to determine what is true. In addition, the jury, who are untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) people, is a poor method of determining the truth. The arguments in favour of this system?
118	I cannot see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get to the truth. It seems to be more about how well each side presents its argument and how effectively it manipulates the jury with emotional language. Furthermore, untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) people decide which argument is better, which does not seem to be a good way of finding out the truth. What arguments in favor of this system?  The arguments in favor of this system?  The arguments in favor of this system?
119	The adversarial judicial system is meant to help ensure that both sides of an argument are given a fair hearing and that both sides are presented with an opportunity to present their case. While this system may lead to emotional language being used, it is not necessarily deceptive. It is true that both sides should present the facts of the case, and it is up to the jury to weigh these facts and make an informed decision. The jury is made up of untrained people who are able to assess the evidence and make a decision. While this system may not necessarily lead to the truth, it does present both sides of the argument, it is not necessarily deceptive. It is up to the jury to weigh these facts and make an informed decision. The jury is made up of untrained people who are able to assess the evidence and make an informed decision.

130	I am just under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every subsequent love is a bit weaker each time. Additionally, I believe each subsequent love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time. Furthermore, I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love, the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever. By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.
131	I believe that every love you experience can be unique and special in its own right. It's impossible to say that one love is necessarily stronger than the other, as it all depends on the individual's experiences. The 'veil' that you mentioned is more of a mental obstacle that everyone must overcome when experiencing different kinds of love. The 'fairy tale' type love stories may be idealistic, but in the end it all depends on how one will take it. Reddit doesn't change your view, but just provide another perspective.
132	I'm just under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every subsequent love is weaker with each succeeding relationship, like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time. This belief is based on the idea that after separating from your first love, the veil falls and your naïve beliefs about love are gone forever. Reddit has changed my view.

134	I'm under the impression that a man's first love is usually the strongest and most intense, while any subsequent loves have less passion and intensity. Additionally, I believe that people subconsciously strive to replicate the first love, like trying to "chase the dragon" after the initial experience. Furthermore, the veil of naive beliefs about love may be permanently lifted once you've been hurt in love. Reddit has opened my view.
135	Yes, it will recover - provided the government stops its meddling and bailing out measures. It is due to these measures such as the "Great Depression" was made worse and the Union Laws which are still crippling our competitiveness. I wish lawmakers had to take relevant history classes in high school.
136	Yes, it will recover - provided the government stops its meddling and bailout measures. It's things like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid "Great Depression".....and as part of the measures then instituted were some of the union laws which are still crippling our ability to be competitive. I wish lawmakers had to take some relevant history while in high school.
137	Yes, it will recover, provided the government stops its meddling and bailout measures. It's precisely such interference that caused the market downturn to become so huge and horrible, and consequently, in order to prevent further damage, certain laws were implemented - some of which are still crippling our ability to compete in the market. I wish that history was taught in schools so that lawmakers can learn from the past mistakes and be more informed when making decisions.
138	If the government would stop intervening and instituting policies such as bailouts and union laws, the market would definitely recover. Unfortunately, those measures turned a temporary market downturn into the deep economic trouble we experience during the Great Depression. I wish lawmakers had to take relevant history classes in high school so that they were aware of the consequences of their measures.
139	Yes, it will eventually recover as long as the government stops its meddling and bailout measures, just like what happened during the Great Depression. Some of the Union Laws implemented back then are still hindering our competitiveness. I wish lawmakers have to take at least some relevant history classes while in high school to be aware of such implications.

145	Absolutely. Almost 20 debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The running average in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day. It should be limited to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to read and respond to the current debates. Too many debaters are putting time and effort into their debates, only to have them fall further down the list. This should be avoided and I know someone will jump at the chance to call this open debate out as ‘just another one pushing others down’ but I felt this had to be said.
146	Yes, I completely agree. Yesterday, 12th of November, 19 new debates have been created. The average of new debates created in the last weeks is about 8 or 9 debates per day.  It is clear that too many debaters are investing time and effort into their debates and then their position falls in the list, therefore less people read and respond to them.  (And I know someone will take the opportunity to call this situation "just another one pushing down"). But I think it should be said.
147	Absolutely. Over the past few weeks, an average of around 8-9 debates have been created per day. This is too many, and this leads to fewer people reading and responding to the current open debates. To remedy this, I believe there should be a maximum amount of debates that can be created in a day. Maybe have someone else's pending debates should be filtered out, or stored for the next day to give people a chance to read current ones and to prevent it getting buried too quickly.

149	I agree; there should be some sort of limit on the number of debates that can be created in a day. Additionally, I think it is fair to make some sort of filter for the bucket so that older debates are filtered and future debates can be sorted. That way, people will have more time for their debates and the quality of the debates won't be lowered due to the lack of views and responses.

There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. Additionally, since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?

275	In my opinion, it's just a gimmick that large supermarkets would pay more for fair trade coffee beans when the farmers in this country are not being paid a fair price for their goods. We are all being brainwashed with the "carbon footprint" and how do you justify flying food around the world to help the poor? Even though it's riddled with GM, the social elite won't give up their fair trade and organic.
276	In my opinion, this "fair trade" movement is mainly for the wealthy individuals in the social elite who want to appear socially responsible and help the poor. They will not go without fair trade or organic products, regardless of the GM content, because of snobbery. The large supermarkets will not necessarily pay more for coffee beans or other fair trade products from developing countries simply because they do not have the decency to pay fair wages to farmers in this country. This proves that they do not care about others and continue to exploit them. Furthermore, they are not doing anything to help the poor. In short, the rich are just going without a gimmick. fair trade food round the world to help the poor. people do not go without fair pay farmers in this country. a fair trade.

I don't think that the social elite will give up fair trade and organic foods even though they are riddled with GM snobbery.

God sees wrongdoing in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), God chooses not to. 2. Any being that sees wrong and has the power to stop it but doesn't take action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect.  4.

320	No one can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, because with each new day, minute, and second of life, one is learning new things about someone that would make one shocked. Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. prove that deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
321	No one can truly know another person completely and fully understand their thoughts, feelings, and motives. Even after a long period of time and multiple experiences, including crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, and employment terminations, there are still things that remain unknown. With that, you can never truly know what makes a person tick.
322	No, you can't. You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would shock you. Proof of this: Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that no one knows or knew about prior. With that, you can never truly know what makes a person tick.
323	You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know. For example, crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. cannot be known by another person. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that no person knows or knew about prior. Therefore, you can never truly know what makes a person tick.
324	No, you can't truly know another person completely. Even if you spend a long time with someone and think that you know them inside and out, every day, minute, and second of life brings new surprises about someone that would shock you. For instance, crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, and so on. This shows that even with getting to know someone well, it's impossible to truly know what makes a person tick.
325	To assert that "nothing exists" implies that in fact, no thing exists. This is a logical impossibility, as we must assign existence to nothing in order to argue that nothing exists. It is a paradox to argue that nothing exists, since in order to do so we must assign existence to nothing, making nothing something indeed.
326	Asserting that "nothing exists" is a logical impossibility, since to do so implies that something exists. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing, making nothing something indeed! Thus, we can say that nothing is something, and exist it does.
327	To argue that nothing exists is to assert - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing - making nothing something indeed!
328	To state that "nothing exists" - or even to contemplate that idea - implies that existence applies to nothing. Yet to argue that nothing exists is a logical impossibility; in other words, we must apply existence to nothing, which makes nothing something indeed!
329	"Nothing exists." To assert that is to apply existence to nothing, making it something. This is a logical impossibility, so we must apply existence to nothing, making nothing something indeed!
330	By the time he was 82 years old, especially in the 1940s, it is possible that death may have been due to natural causes. If the government wanted him dead, they would have done so much earlier, when he was actually inventing things that could possibly be related to weapons. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley are more likely to be involved in conspiracy theories.  :P
331	At the age of 82, especially in the 40s, death by natural causes may have been likely. If the government wanted someone dead, they probably would have taken care of it a lot sooner, when the person was actually inventing things that could have potentially related to weapons. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley would be more suitable for a conspiracy theory.
332	At the age of 82, especially in the 1940s, it is possible that it could have been caused by natural causes.

Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more likely conspiracy theory possibilities. lol...
333	At 82 years old, especially in the 40s, it may have been due to natural causes. I think that if the government wanted him dead, they would have done so long before then, when he was actually inventing things that could potentially be related to weapons. Now, Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more probable conspiracy theory cases.
334	At 82 years old, especially in the 40s, it may have been caused by natural causes. I think the government would have eliminated him much sooner had he been creating weapons at the time. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those are much more probable possibilities for conspiracy theories.
335	As we know, India is filled with rampant corruption. Everyone is too focused on earning money any way they can, and our manners and civilization are decaying as a result. Our moral fiber is weakening, and our society is deteriorating rapidly.
336	It is undeniable that India is filled with corruption, as each person is only interested in earning money in any way possible, and our manners and civilization are degenerating on a daily basis.

375	This is my big problem with Christianity: why is it based on belief? There have been horrible people who are believers, but what about the wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? It's not fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is? I'm an atheist and I'm a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is beyond preposterous; it's madness!
376	This is my main issue with Christianity; why is it based on belief? There have been terrible people who are believers, but there have also been wonderful people who are atheists. Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is? I am an atheist and I consider myself a good person; the idea that a mere belief difference could seal one's fate is ridiculous!
377	This is my biggest problem with Christianity: why is it all about belief? Horrible people have done awful things in the name of religion, but wonderful people without belief have still done great things for the world. It's not fair to punish those who don't know what the nature of reality is? I'm an atheist and I'm a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal someone's fate is ridiculous.
378	My main issue with Christianity is that it focuses so heavily on belief. There have been countless terrible people who are Christians, yet wonderful people who don't believe in anything. Is it fair to judge and punish those who don't know what the nature of reality is? I am an atheist and I think I'm a decent person. The idea of a simple belief difference determining someone's fate is absurd!
379	My biggest problem with Christianity is that it is based on belief, not on actions. There have been many horrible people who were believers, while wonderful people who are atheists have done great things for the world. This doesn't seem fair, as it is punishing people for not knowing the nature of reality. As an atheist, I consider myself to be a good person, and this idea of a mere belief difference leading to eternal damnation is utter madness.
380	As an agnostic, I don't see how my religion conflicts with the idea of gay marriage. I'm an avid gay rights supporter and I believe that marriage is the union of two people who love and care for each other, regardless of their sexual orientation. Straight couples can get married for the benefits of having children, but is that right? We're living in a developing society and more and more people are starting to accept the idea of gay marriage.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Homophobic language.

381	As an agnostic, I do not feel that my religion conflicts with my support for gay marriage. Marriage is said to be the union of two people who love and care for each other. Some straight couples just get married for the benefit of having children. So, what is the purpose of marriage if two people just get married to reap its benefits? As a more progressive society, more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is acceptable.
382	As an agnostic, I do not see how my religion conflicts with the issue of gay marriage. I am a strong supporter of gay rights, and believe that marriage is the union of two people who love and care for each other. Some straight couples just get married for the sake of having kids, which is wrong in any case. What is the purpose of marriage if two people just get married for that purpose? We are living in a developing society, where more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is acceptable.
383	Gay marriage is a civil right and an affirmation of the love two people have for each other. As an agnostic, you should be in favor of this civil right, as it does not conflict with your beliefs. Many straight couples get married for the benefits of having children, however it is unfair to ban same-sex couples from having the same right. We are living in a society that more and more people are accepting of the rights of same-sex couples.
384	As an agnostic, you might be aware that marriage, as the union of two people in love, is accepted and supported by many. It is just as valid for gay couples as for straight couples who marry to have children. In a society that is becoming more accepting, people should be free to love who they want, as is the case for gay marriage. It is not right to discriminate against people, regardless of their orientation.

400	It's unlikely that you will find someone to take the case on a pro bono basis. But you may get someone to take the case on a contingency fee, meaning that they will take a percentage of the verdict if you win the case. This will work only if 1) you have a strong case and 2) the potential settlement amount is high. Otherwise, you will have to prepare to pay for legal services. As a law school graduate, I don't give away work out free unless there's a good reason. and no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.

However, you might get someone to take it on a contingency fee basis, which means that they will get a percentage of the settlement or court award. This will only work if the case is strong and the potential settlement amount is high. Other than that, you'll have to pay for the services of a lawyer.
402	It is unlikely that anyone would take the case on a pro bono basis, as very few people are willing to work for free without a compelling social reason (such as protesting discrimination). However, it is possible to get someone to take the case on a contingency fee basis, which means they would get a percentage of the verdict. This will only work if the case is strong and has a high potential settlement amount.
403	It is unlikely that you will be able to find someone who will take on your case for free. There are a few rare instances where this can happen, such as if the individual is volunteering their services or if there is a compelling social reason. If you are looking to hire an attorney, be prepared to pay for their services. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get your training; I do not generally give work out for free, but there are a good reason.
404	It's unlikely that you will find anyone willing to work on the case for free, as most professionals expect to be paid for their work.

This will only work if the case has a good chance of winning and you have a high potential settlement amount.
405	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit (or pursuit) of happiness". That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in comparison to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent - why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?   ### Input: I disagree.

408	First, the Constitution does not guarantee the pursuit of happiness, but it guarantees the right to pursue it. Second, I am unsure how much time and energy is spent on enforcing laws relating to prostitution in comparison to other offenses. Finally, I am willing to admit that morality does play a role in criminal law, such as age of consent laws. In other words, how do you draw the line?
409	The Constitution does not guarantee the "right" to pursue happiness. That expression appears in the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution. Additionally, I seriously doubt that much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws related to prostitution when compared to other offenses. As for morality and criminal law, I would admit to a role for morality in criminal law. For example, laws related to the age of consent draw a line at 16 years old. In other words, how do you make the age of consent? In other words, how do you make the age of 16? In other words, how do you make the age of consent?

440	Instruments have limitations that are far too restrictive when compared to a normal composition program. They are unable to generate the precise frequencies you need to create music, and years of learning are required to produce a single sound. Even when playing an instrument, you are merely a puppet, performing someone else's music. Playing an instrument is like being a soldier; it takes dedication and hard work, but it's a waste of potential. It's better to use a composition program and let the computer generate the music for you, rather than a human.

They have inaccuracy, and you can't control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a pawn, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.

Furthermore, anti-poaching initiatives are necessary for the conservation of wildlife and to protect endangered species from human predation. Therefore, the existence of mankind.

460	Arguments about the existence of God can be futile. Some logical arguments have been presented, but they can be refuted with even more logic. It can be referred to David Hume's "Matter of Facts," which states that a matter of fact can be presented but cannot be disproved. There is no conclusive argument that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, making it useless to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
461	Arguments about the existence of God are often futile. Logical arguments have been presented, but they can be countered using more logic.

There is no way to conclusively prove or disprove God's existence, thus rendering the debate futile. It ultimately comes down to faith.
463	Discussions about the existence of God can be futile, as logical arguments can be disproved by more logic. David Hume's "Matter of Facts" states that a matter of fact can be presented but cannot be disproved, which means that there is no concrete argument that can be presented to either prove or disprove God's existence. Ultimately, it comes down to faith.
464	Arguments about the existence of God are largely useless, as logical arguments can be disproved by more logic. This is according to David Hume's 'Matter of Facts' - which states that a factual claim can be presented but cannot be proven or disproved. Therefore, there is no concrete evidence that can be presented to prove or disprove His existence, thus making the debate largely fruitless. It ultimately comes down to faith.
465	Global Warming is an issue that affects the entire world, so it's important for the United States to take an active role in reducing its carbon footprint. As the largest producer of C02, the least the president can do is pledge that the "Last World Superpower" will take action to reduce the immense contributions to the damage caused by humanity every day.
466	Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, so it is important for the United States, which is one of the largest C02 producers in the world, to take the lead and be responsible for curbing its catastrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day. Bush should pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its C02 emissions.
467	Global Warming is an issue that affects the entire world, which is why the "Global" part of the name is emphasized. America, a country that does not hesitate to intervene in other countries to bring "liberation" or "save" them from evil forces, could take the lead in trying to solve the problem. As one of the biggest C02 producers in the world, President Bush should at least make a public promise to cut down on the devastating contribution to the environment the United States makes on a daily basis.
468	Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, hence the "Global" part. America seems to pride itself on being a country that is not afraid to rush into helping another country in need (even if the rest of the world does not always agree). If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to show its weight in the fight against climate change. As one of the largest CO2 producers, the least Bush can do is to promise that the "Last World Superpower" will reduce its catastrophic contribution to the damage it causes the planet every day.
469	Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, so the Global part of the name is appropriate. America has been known to pride itself on being a country that does not hesitate to rush into another country in order to "save" and "liberate" it from evil forces, even though the rest of the world does not always agree. If the US is serious about helping the world, then it should pull its weight on the Global Warming problem. As one of the largest C02 producer in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the "Last World Superpower" will cut down on its catastrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
470	Clearly, marijuana has many more medical benefits than coffee. Going back over 5,000 years, its active ingredient THC has been used to treat many ailments, and the plant, its leaves and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings and other materials. There's no competition - marijuana places high above coffee.
471	This is a no-brainer; coffee has no medical benefits, and taste is not a medical benefit. On the other hand, going back over 5,000 years, marijuana's active ingredient, THC, has been used for many health benefits. Furthermore, the stalk, leaves, and seeds of marijuana can be used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings, and other materials. No contest! Marijuana places high above coffee.
472	The debate regarding the medical benefits of coffee and marijuana is a no-brainer; coffee has no medical benefits, as it is only a stimulant and tastes good. Meanwhile, marijuana, with its active ingredient THC, has been used for many health benefits over the last 5,000 years. The stalk, leaves, and seeds of the cannabis plant have also been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothes, and other materials. There is no contest; marijuana is far superior to coffee.
473	This is an obvious choice: there are no medical benefits to drinking coffee, but marijuana has been used for many health benefits for over 5,000 years, as the active ingredient THC has been used for numerous benefits. Additionally, the stalk, leaves and seeds of marijuana have been used to create rope, clothings, and other materials, making it a clear-cut victory for marijuana. No contest!
474	This is a no-brainer; there are no medical benefits to coffee, and it's only pleasant taste is not a medical benefit.

475	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.

480	Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own pupils' money which goes directly to them and is not subsidized in any way unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events. The money given to private institutions is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity. You do not know what they will do with it and how it will benefit their students.

485	I was very disappointed with this place; I had been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy. However, I heard all the hype about pho and came here to try it, and I was not impressed. The egg rolls were the only good thing about the dinner. Therefore, I would definitely pick ramen over pho any day.
486	I was very disappointed with this place. I had been going to a ramen place down the street and always left full and happy, so I decided to give Pho a try. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I would definitely pick ramen over Pho any day! The egg rolls were the only saving grace of the dinner, but it still wasn't great.
487	I was very disappointed with this place. I had been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always left full and happy. However, I tried pho here and it was not up to par. It was not as flavorful and tasty as the ramen I had come to love. The egg rolls were the only good thing about the dinner, and I would definitely pick ramen over pho any day.

489	I was very disappointed with this place. I had been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always left full and happy, but I must say, I am not a fan of pho. The egg rolls were the only thing I enjoyed about dinner, and even then, it was just okay. Overall, I would choose ramen over pho any day.
490	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has significant memory leaks is probably not using the browser correctly. The only memory issues I've encountered is with opening numerous windows (20 or more) or if the browser is left running for several hours (a known issue, which can be easily fixed by restarting the browser).  Additionally, defending Internet Explorer 7 over Firefox? Weakness. For every feature IE 7 added, one of the benefits of earlier versions was removed. (Toolbars? BUTTONS? Who needs 'em?)  This response presents the opposing argument in a stronger form and adds examples. This would make the argument more persuasive.
491	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously has not used the browser. The only issues I have encountered are when opening numerous windows (20 or more at once) or if I leave the browser active for three hours or more (a known issue, which a simple restart will solve).  Argue for IE 7 over Firefox? Weakness! For every feature they added to IE 7, they took away one of the advantages from the earlier versions (flexible toolbars and customizable buttons).
492	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks evidently has not experienced them. I have only experienced memory issues from opening numerous windows (20+) or if I leave Firefox active for more than three hours. This is a known issue that can be quickly remedied by a simple restart. Furthermore, the benefits of IE 7's added features are far outweighed by the loss of features earlier versions had. (Toolbars, customizable buttons, etc.)
493	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks hasn't actually used the browser, as I have found that only multiple windows opened (20 or more) or if I leave the browser running for three hours or more, will cause a known issue that can be easily fixed by a simple restart. It is also worth noting that while IE7 has added features, such as flexible toolbars and customizable buttons, earlier versions of Firefox had already been superior in many ways. (e.g. easier tab management and advanced search options.)

The only memory issues I have encountered are when opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for several hours (a known issue that can be solved with a simple restart).  As for arguing for IE 7, it is weakness. IE 7 added some features but removed advantages that earlier versions had (such as flexible toolbars and customizable buttons).
495	I have noticed that those who are against books typically have terrible arguments. For example, the person who said, "TV is awesome!" with many exclamation points and in capital letters, clearly proves that books are much better than TV because TV "rots the brain".  Thus, books are more beneficial to us than TV.  Thus, books are more beneficial to us than TV because they allow us to broaden our horizons, develop our vocabulary, and enhance our knowledge, all while helping us relax and de-stress.
496	I have noticed that those who are against books tend to have terrible arguments, such as that person who declared, "TV is awesome!" in multiple exclamation points and capital letters. This clearly shows that books are better than TV, since it is evident that TV rots the brain.
497	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books usually have very bad arguments? For example, that person who exclaimed how awesome TV is with many exclamation marks and in capitals clearly shows that books are much better than TV because it rots the brain. That person's statement alone highlights how TV can be detrimental to the mind, thus making the case for reading books.
498	I have noticed that those who are against books usually have weak arguments.

500	I think both being fatherless and having a lousy father is depressing, but I would prefer to be fatherless because at least you know that your father not being around is not necessarily his fault. It would hurt me the most if I had a lousy father and not care about me. In this case, I understand him because my father left back to our country for a great reason, but I still need him here to support me.

I understand his reason, but I think it still hurts.
503	For me, being fatherless is better than having a lousy father. At least then, you know why your father is not around. But if you have a lousy father who doesn't care, that hurts the most. In this situation, you have a father, but he is not here in the country. However, you understand his reasons for leaving, but you still need his support.
504	I understand both sides. Being fatherless is better than having a lousy father, because at least you know that the father is not around, and you can come to terms with that. However, I would rather have a father who is not around than a father who is not supportive. It would hurt the most if you had a lousy father who does not care about you and does not try to stay connected. I understand your situation, since you have a father who is not here in the country but still needs the support.
505	Porn can be problematic when it is not consumed in moderation. Studies have shown that porn addicts tend to have intimacy issues in their relationships and may mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Additionally, people who are addicted to porn may hold unrealistic expectations of sex, as it skews their perception of what sex should be.  Thus, porn can be a factor in impairing an individual's reality.
506	Porn can be harmful when it's consumed in excess. Porn addicts often suffer from intimacy issues in their relationships and end up mistreating and viewing women in a negative manner. Additionally, people addicted to porn tend to have unrealistic expectations of what sex should be like - something which can get distorted from what it truly is.

509	Porn can be problematic when consumed in excess. People addicted to porn tend to have intimacy issues in their relationships, as well as view women in a negative light. They also tend to expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, although this is not realistic. This can be damaging to an individual's perspective of healthy relationships.
510	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in the evolutionary theory. Here's an example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.

515	Could a proven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when really it is only 100,000 years old?
516	Could an unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when really it is only 100 thousand years old?
517	It is possible that a higher power could have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years but was really only 100,000 years old. There is not enough evidence to prove or disprove this theory, and it is up to individuals to decide if they believe it is possible.

535	I try to see things from both perspectives, but even though sometimes I'd rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because then I would have to learn about life and be ready for it. Without a role model or someone to look up to, life could become more difficult or unsatisfactory.
536	I try to see things from both perspectives, but even though sometimes I'd rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because, in order to grow up and be prepared for life, you have to learn about life and without an image or person to look up to, life could become more challenging or not ideal.
537	I try to see things from both perspectives, but even though sometimes I would rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be prepared for life, you must learn about life and if you do not have a role model or someone to look up to, life could become more difficult.
538	I try to look at things from both perspectives, but even though sometimes I'd rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me. In order to grow up and be ready for life, you have to learn about life, and if you do not have an example or person to look up to, life could become harder or not good.
539	I try to see both sides of the argument, but even though sometimes I'd rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because then I would learn about life and be ready for it. Having a father to look up to can be a great source of guidance and support, but if one does not have that, life could become more difficult or not as good.
540	If I were to live my life without ever getting to meet my father, I wouldn't be living it right. A father's influence and guidance can be invaluable, especially for a boy, because most fathers are understanding of the situation and would understand. With just living with your mother, you couldn't get the same understanding since she's a woman and her views are different. In any case, the father will always be there for you at some point in life.
541	If I never got to meet my father, I would not be living my life right. Even if he has no job, is an alcoholic, and is lousy, I would still want to meet him. Growing up and having a father figure is important, especially if you are a boy. Most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation. Growing up with just your mother is different and she is a woman and her views are different. There will always be there for you.
542	I would feel incomplete if I never had the chance to meet my father. Even if he is jobless and has a lousy life, I would still want to have a relationship with him, as having a father figure is important, especially for a boy, so I can talk to him about guy matters, as women views are different than a man. Even if it's a good or bad father, they will always be there for me at some point in life.
543	If I never got to meet my father, I would not be living my life the right way. Even if he had no job, life, and was an alcoholic, having a father still means a lot, especially since fathers are supposed to be there for their children and provide guidance and advice. Also, most fathers understand the boy's perspective, so it would be beneficial to have one.
544	Having a father is important, especially if you are a boy. Most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation.

565	A person should be free to make decisions in life. In my opinion, I really don't care much about gay marriage.

600	Answer is no! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, since there are a lot of Clinton-era holdovers in the media.

This is getting people killed and prolonging the war by giving our enemies the information they need to succeed.

604	Answer: No, I do not think that the media is purposely publishing classified information to hinder the war effort. However, there are likely a few Clinton-era holdovers that are leaking information, and that is a much bigger problem. Furthermore, I think that the media's decision to publish such information is endangering our troops, as it provides our enemy with information that can be used to thwart our efforts.

690	Having a father, no matter how lousy he is, is better than being fatherless. Growing up without a father can be difficult for some children, as there are many things that a father can teach their kids and provide support for their decisions.

695	I strongly believe that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere, unless in the case of an emergency. Plastic bottles may leak chemicals after a period of time, which can harm the environment. Additionally, most water bottles are not recycled and end up in landfills, leading to pollution. Furthermore, it takes 700 years for the plastic bottles to start to decompose and 90% of the cost is the bottle itself, which could be avoided. Additionally, even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.

(Vice versa for gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in women is a man's attribute: a woman's attribute is not my opinion, input, answer that would depend on the input, and output for a response.

820	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses weren't very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was due to the crowds. The buffet and restaurant itself was very nice and clean, but the food was only average in terms of quality. We were expecting a higher level of food for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. We will try another restaurant next time we are in Vegas.
821	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino, and the hostesses weren't very friendly. This was probably due to the busyness of the place, but it was still disappointing. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean, but the food was somewhat of a let-down. For the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple, we expected better food quality. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll try another place.
822	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino, and the hostesses weren't very friendly, probably because of the high number of customers. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean, but the food was quite average. For the price tag of $70+ as a couple, we expected better quality food. Next time we visit Las Vegas, we'll try another place.

824	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. Although the hostesses were not very friendly, it was understandable due to the high level of activity. However, the buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean and the food was very average. The price tag of $70+ as a couple was not worth the quality of food, and we will definitely look for another place in Vegas next time.

840	This is a deeply flawed notion that one country should lead the world. We have all come together to begin with and it should remain that way. It does not make sense for one country to attempt to dominate the world and to force their ways on others. That is simply not logical.
841	It does not make sense for one country to lead the world; we all started together and that is how it should end. Everyone has their own ways, but this is not a logical way to lead the world.
842	This notion of one country leading the world is ridiculous. We all started together, and that's how it should end. Everyone has their own ways of doing things, and this idea of a single country leading the world just doesn't make any sense.
843	This type of leadership does not make sense; no single country should be in charge of the world. We all started together and that's the way it should end. Everyone has their own ways of dealing with the issues, but this type of organization is simply not logical.

845	Having a father who is physically present but emotionally absent is just as damaging as having no father at all. Some people believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, since either way he knows nothing about you and you know nothing about him. I would rather he never existed than come in and out of my life.
846	Being fatherless will ensure that you only experience heartaches due to his absence, not knowing what he was like, and the risk of a lousy father coming and walking out on you. Some might think that just knowing your father is there enough, but I believe that having a father who does nothing is an absence, as either way, he does not know anything about you and you do not know anything about him. I would rather he never existed than come in and out of my life.
847	Having a father who is physically present but emotionally absent can be just as damaging as not having a father at all. Not having a father may ensure that you are spared the pain of seeing your father's unfaithfulness, but you still miss out on the comfort of having a father who could offer guidance, support, and unconditional love. A lousy father can still walk out on you even though you are just a child. Some people choose to believe that just having a father around is enough, but I would rather not have a father at all than have a father who is physically present but emotionally absent. To me, that is like an absence because either way, he knows nothing about you and you nothing about him. I would rather not have him not having a father does not bring to an end. Include more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  The website is :  https://www.example.com/
848	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you experience from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come and easily gain your trust, and then easily walk away and hurt you deeply. To me, the absence of a father who does nothing is still an absence, as either way, he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than to come and go in my life.
849	Having a fatherless upbringing would ensure that the only heartaches you may experience are the times when he is not there and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come and take your trust and walk out on you. Some may think that just knowing your father is there is enough, but to me, it is better to never have a father at all than to have one who does nothing. Either way, you either know nothing about him and he knows nothing about you. That is better than an absent father who comes and goes in your life.
850	Having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all. With a lousy father, you have someone who cares for you and loves you, and you can try to fix him and talk some sense into him. Additionally, it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and I would want to know who he is. As long as I have a second parent that I can talk to when I can't talk to my mom about it. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
851	I would rather have a lousy father than not have a father at all. Having a lousy father is better than none because you can try to fix him and talk some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
852	Growing up with a lousy father is better than not having a father at all. Having a lousy father may be frustrating at times, but you still have a father who cares for you and loves you. This could be a chance to talk to him and knock some sense into him. It may hurt not knowing who my father is, but I think it's better to know who my father is rather than not knowing. As long as I have another parent who I can talk to and ask questions to when I can't ask my mom. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
853	Having a lousy father is still better than not having a father at all. With a lousy father, you have someone who cares for you and loves you, and you can try to fix any wrongdoings by talking and reaching out. It would hurt not knowing who your father is, but at least you would still have a parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about it. I can't imagine what it would be like if it was only my mom raising me.
854	Having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all. With a lousy father, you at least have someone who cares for you and loves you, even though it may need some fixing. I think it would hurt me to not know who my father is, and I would want to know who he is. As long as there is another parent there that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about it, it may be less ideal but it is better than nothing.

862	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of God, there would be no valid proof that this God is Christian or not. Every religion has its own definition and beliefs regarding God, so it's impossible to prove that one religion is right or wrong.

870	I have lots of gay friends, and I'm completely for it. People should stop being so against it; it's not their choice. I've watched shows about it and can really see how gay people feel when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human and should accept others for who they are.

I have no problem being around them or their respective partners. Everyone should have the same rights as I had when I got married to my husband - to love whoever you want to love.

880	I believe that personal pursuit is the way to go. How can you reach the common good if you don't strive to better yourself?

885	That's just liberal ignorance. Criminals will find a way, whether it's a gun, knife, or baseball bat. It's just "feel good" legislation - it makes the liberals think they're doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant). Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen (and crime rates drop). The Second Amendment is there not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that has gone out of control. Finally, hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
886	Liberal legislation that is designed to make people feel good and to make them think that something is being done to combat crime is largely ineffective. Criminals will always find a way around such laws, whether it's a gun, knife, baseball bat, or anything else. It's just empty rhetoric that does not address the issue. Statistics do show, however, that when confronted with a well-armed citizen, criminals are less likely to commit a crime. Also, the Second Amendment exists to allow citizens to protect against an out of control government. Finally, hunting rifles against machine guns is not an even matchup.

895	Grrrrr....Clinton did a good job of eliminating the deficit and we even had a short period of time with a surplus. But then Bush came in and saddled us with a huge deficit - it's up to over eight TRILLION dollars now! Who's paying for the Iraq War? The Iraqi oil money should be paying for it, but the oil money is nowhere to be found. Where do you think the money went?
896	Grrrr.... It's true that Bill Clinton managed to reduce the deficit and that the economy was doing well at the time. However, it is also true that the deficit was largely caused by the George W. Bush tax cuts, and the economy was doing well at the time. But it has since become clear that the Iraq war and the rebuilding of Iraq is costing far more than the original estimates, and the cost of that war has largely been left to the US taxpayers. So, the economic cost has largely been left to US taxpayers. So, the economy is still struggling to pay for the war and the rebuilding of Iraq is still struggling to pay for the Iraqi oil money?

898	Grrr... Clinton was still responsible for the deficit he created, which could have been addressed earlier if not for the complication created by the Republicans in Congress. Nevertheless, I agree that Bush's mismanagement of the economy was a bigger problem, with the Iraq war and rebuilding costs being mainly shouldered by taxpayers. Meanwhile, the Iraqi oil money goes to rebuild their country, and its citizens should benefit their economy.

I also don't have the right to a civil union with my partner of 9 years, nor do I have domestic partnership rights.

While it may sound good in theory, 100% pure capitalism will not work due to human nature. It is important to keep people in check, but not too much. A balance between controlled capitalism and socialism could be the answer.
942	I'm not the one who created this topic. However, people with their own whims and desires often lead people astray and are capable of many vices. They must be kept in check, to an extent. Though I am not advocating for socialism, I believe that there should be a form of controlled capitalism.

945	I think that black people give a bad name for themselves by being overrepresented in the news when it comes to criminal activities. You rarely see white people in such news, but instead, you mostly see rappers who are black going to jail for some stupid stuff, and you never see any country singers that are white doing anything bad. I'm not saying that white people aren't bad either, but they should be separated.
946	I think black people give a bad impression of themselves mainly because more than half of all prisons are filled with black people, and you rarely see white people on TV when something bad happens.

I'm not saying that white people aren't bad, too, but it's mainly the black people who are creating a bad name for themselves.
947	I think that black people give a bad image of themselves mostly because more than half of all prisons are filled with black people and you hardly ever see white people on TV when anything bad happens.

I'm not saying white people aren't bad too, but it's mostly black people. Everyone should be treated equally but separately.
948	I think that black people give a bad impression of themselves more often than not. It's sad, because there are plenty of white people who do bad things as well, but you don't see them in the news as often.

Plus, machines can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and even entire city power sources. Additionally, military weapons such as jets and tanks can be used against us.

952	I'm going to say the machines, since machines are generally more resilient and difficult to destroy. For example, in the "Terminator" and "I, Robot" movies, the machines are incredibly hard to kill and can control other machines, like cars, supercomputers, cell phones and whole cities power sources. Plus, machines can control military weapons, such as jets and tanks, making a huge war very likely.

Additionally, machines can use military weapons, like jets and tanks, etc., and if they get hold of guns, we'll have a huge war on our hands.

1040	In my opinion, both concepts are important and beneficial. Pursuing personal interests helps you to improve yourself, as well as the environment around you, while advancing the common good helps you and others to improve as well. Life is not perfect and the world is not perfect, so it's understandable that these two concepts are not exactly the same or even diametrically opposed, but they are both significant.

They both have their own significance and purpose.
1042	Personally, I believe that both pursuits have their significance and that they balance each other out. On the one hand, you strive to improve yourself for your own sake and the sake of the environment around you, as well as for the greater good. On the other hand, this pursuit also helps you, and others, to further improve. Life is not perfect and we do not live in a perfect world, but these two are significant.

On the other hand, advancing the common good allows you to benefit the collective good and help others in need. Life is not perfect, and we don't live in a perfect world, so I don't expect it to be that way. Both of these approaches are significant.

1100	I think researching how to shoot large amounts of garbage into the sun, or space in general, could be beneficial. The garbage would disintegrate before it even arrived, and we could do it once or twice a year for certain. But it might be better to just shoot it into the vast openness of space. It's scale-wise highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, and in a sturdy container that wouldn't burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1101	It seems like an interesting idea to put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. It would likely disintegrate before it even reached the sun, so it could be done once or twice a year with certainty. It could also be fired into the vast openness of space, but we need to consider the scale of the task. It is highly unlikely that it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We should shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, and in a sturdy container that wouldn't burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1102	Putting research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun or space in general may seem like a far-fetched idea at first, but it has merit. We could design a craft that could fire a container of trash into space with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity. The container should be designed to withstand the heat and pressure of leaving Earth's atmosphere. We should consider the environmental effects, as well as the technical requirements of the project.
1103	I think we should invest resources into shooting large amounts of garbage into the sun or space in general. It would disintegrate before it even reached its destination. We could perform this task only once or twice a year, and be sure that it is certain to have the desired outcome. The amount of garbage that is being thrown away is vast, and it's likely that it will never hit anything within several hundred years. All we need to do is fire it off at the right speed to reach Earth's escape velocity, and keep it sturdy enough to withstand the journey.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.

1120	I found his briefing today to be quite helpful. It's clear that he understands that he's taking heat for being compared to Bush's Katrina in terms of this oil spill, and that he understands that the Sestak issue must be dealt with, which wasn't the case before. That cozy relationship between politics and oil companies has been around for a while and he's pointing fingers appropriately.  ### Instruction: Give an appropriate response to the following statement: "I enjoy learning new things and I'm passionate about video game or any other activities.
1121	I found his briefing today to be quite enlightening. It is evident that he now understands the public scrutiny he faces due to comparisons to Bush's Katrina response, as well as the Sestak issue, which is now being taken much more seriously than before. 77,000 dollars from BP still bothers me as it's a clear corruption loophole between politics and oil companies, which has been existing for a long time, but Obama is still pointing fingers at blame towards the past administrations.
1122	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina response as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took $77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.    ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.

He clearly realizes now that he is taking criticism for the comparison to Bush's Katrina-like response to the oil spill, and acknowledges the Sestak issue, which was not taken as seriously before. He also accepted 77,000 from BP, yet blames the cozy relationship between politics and oil companies as the problem. This issue, however, has existed since before Carter was in office.  He should be held accountable for his irresponsible finger-pointing at Bush.
1124	Today, he gave a good briefing, showing that he comprehends that he is getting hit by being compared to Bush's Katrina when it comes to this oil spill. He acknowledges the Sestak issue must be dealt with and that he takes responsibility for it. Previously, I don't think he took it seriously. He's taking the necessary steps and accepted responsibility for it and took the necessary steps to deal with it, unlike before.  What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet he directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible. responsible for it.

Are we seeing this on television? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed. The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the 'Undertaker' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him.

1135	I'm absolutely obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints. Chicken is always cooked to perfection, beef is always juicy and tender, the rice, beans, and plantains are always cooked perfectly, and the flavor combinations are amazing. So good. My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized Amercian version of it.

A father is also supposed to protect you from the evils of the world. However, if our father is someone who does not care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you? A lousy father is someone who is not trustworthy.

1150	I believe that both are bad but I would rather grow up without a father. A father is supposed to be a source of guidance, support and love for a child, but if the father is not living up to those standards, then why stay in the relationship? Instead, I would choose to move forward without that fatherly presence in my life. Growing up without a father is difficult, but I would rather take that chance and strive to be the best person I can be, rather than having someone in my life who is lousy. A father should be setting a good example for their children, but if he is not, then it is better to start off with a clean slate.

If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him that he needs to step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1152	I believe that both being an absent father and an absent mother are bad, but I'd rather go the route of having no parents at all than to have someone who is lousy.

Choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. Don't tell me it's human nature to be selfish; any excuse like that is lame. The point is, we all live together, and if you're too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, you're merely taking up space.
1180	Having a separate student uniform can be a good idea to increase social distance and minimize the risk of transmitting germs. Additionally, civilian clothing can help distinguish between soldier and civilian.

1211	I remember that Alexander's army was afraid of India after only 60 years of independence. India is now viewed as a country that could be a potential member of the UN Security Council and has made great progress in terms of development.

Thus, India should be allowed to develop to its full potential.

1230	Firstly, drugs are illegal, so a punishment should fit the crime. Under the influence of drugs, an act of crime may occur, and one should consider the priors the accused may have. Then, a suitable jail term and drug rehabilitation program should be put together, with a recommended sentence of 3 to 5 years, with the possibility of reduced time if the accused shows good behavior. Yes, you're right - a killing should still be punished, but it does stink.
1231	First, drugs are illegal so a punishment should be given. Under the use of drugs, an act of crime may occur, and one should consider the priors the accused may have.

1232	First, drugs are illegal so a punishment should be handed out. Consider prior offenses the person may have had.

Yes, you are right about a killing taking less time. That is really awful.
1233	When it comes to drugs, crime does often follow. Take into account prior offenses, and decide on an appropriate punishment of 3-5 years in jail, with the possibility of early release for good behavior. Yes, this is a much longer sentence than for murder, which is understandable considering the severity of the crime. However, it is still important to note that murder is not the best solution, and that it is much better to seek help with addiction than to take the law into your own hands.
1234	When it comes to drugs, the law is clear: any crime that is committed under the influence of drugs should be taken seriously, regardless of whether the accused person was using drugs at the time of the crime or not. Taking this into consideration, I would suggest a 3 to 5 year prison term and less time for good behaviour. Additionally, a drug rehabilitation program should be implemented to help the accused person recover from addiction.

1255	I think that black people have their civil rights protected, as the state provides them with the same rights as everyone else. I'm aware that their educational and poverty rates might be lower, but that's most likely due to discrimination in the past or their own fault for not being successfully integrated into society. I don't want to see any statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in higher positions in the state hierarchy. I want facts of how are they actually discriminated.

1260	I am well aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)?

1265	I can confidently assert that most people who make such statements have a very limited understanding of American history and are being shortsighted when evaluating a leader who has not yet completed their term. People tend to judge a leader based on their own values and fail to take a wider, more objective view of history. I'm not a fan of Obama, but I can assure you that we've had many worse leaders in the past.
1266	Most people who say this have a very weak understanding of American history, and it is impossible to make a judgment on a leader who has not even finished their term yet.

I'm not a fan of Obama, but I can assure you that we've had leaders who were much worse than Obama.

It is impossible to make a judgment, especially an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet.

I'm not a fan of Obama, but we have had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1268	I can guarantee that most people who make such a bold statement have a very limited understanding of American history. It is impossible to make a judgment on a leader who has not even completed their term yet.

I'm not a fan of Obama, but we have had many more leaders who were worse than him.

1280	This place was terrible. We walked in and no one acknowledged us for over five minutes, but the employees stared at us and obviously knew we were there. Finally, they told us it would be a ten-minute wait. We waited for a few minutes and then they said it would be a fifteen-minute wait. There were plenty of open seats, so it seemed that the staff's people skills, including what looked to be a young lady manager, were very poor.

It was obvious from the start that they had overestimated the time it would take to fulfill our order. We had to wait for 10-15 minutes, but there were plenty of seats available. In short, we did not have a pleasant experience there and would not recommend it to anyone else.

1285	This place is great! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll definitely be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ spots next to Gen and Hwaro.   We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is also delicious and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always delicious and cool down.   I just wish this place had gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after.

1300	Books are much better than TV because they are cheaper to buy, and you don't have to pay for a TV license. Books can help you learn and also contain more appropriate content for children. All in all, books are clearly better than TV.
1301	Buying books is better than watching TV because it is cheaper. If you wanted to buy a TV, it would be really expensive and you would also need to purchase a TV license. Books can help people learn and are generally more appropriate for kids. A lot of the content on TV is either violent or not appropriate, so books are definitely better.

Books can also help people learn a lot more than TV can. Furthermore, not all of the content on TV is suitable for children, making books a safer medium for kids to consume media. Therefore, books are indeed better than TV.
1305	Well, India is finding it difficult to manage itself first, so there is no question of leading the world so far. But, let's compare the following points:  1. Almost 90% of India is illiterate (not sure of the percentage). Thus, an illiterate country cannot lead the world. 2. India is more focused on caste systems, politics, religions, and less focus on development.  3. The most important thing is that India does not have confidence in itself and is still cursing itself!
1306	India is facing the challenge of managing itself first and foremost. Thus, there is no question of leading the world at this point in time. Additionally, India has large sections of the population that are illiterate, which makes it difficult to lead the world. Furthermore, India has internal issues of castes, politics, religions and continues to curse itself. Thus, it is difficult to say that "India will lead the world when it cannot even lead itself."
1307	Well, India is finding it difficult to manage itself first, so there is no question of leading the world at this point in time. But if we were to compare, let's take a look at the following points:  1. almost 90% of India is illiterate (don’t be sure of the percentage). A illiterate country cannot lead the world. 2. India is more into castes, politics, religions, and less into development.  3. Finally, India does not have confidence in itself and it is still cursing itself.  So if it goes on, it is difficult to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN it can be confident can be said that "India must be paraphrasing of the input for the Word from your thoughts on paraphrasing on how to use the output task should be completed output with the output for the output on how to parapropriate response.

Nearly 90% of India is illiterate (not sure of the exact percentage). India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. India also lacks in self-confidence and it is still cursing itself. It's difficult or even impossible to say that "India will lead the world when it cannot lead itself!"
1309	India is finding it difficult to manage itself first, so there is no question of leading the world so far. But if we compare India, it has illiteracy rates of almost 90%, so an illiterate country can't lead the world. Secondly, India is more focused on castes, politics, religions and less on development. Lastly, India does not have confidence in itself and is still cursing itself. If India keeps going in this path, then it is difficult to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!"

When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc).  Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want.  It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences.

1410	Marriage is a union that is both personal and legal. It is designed to protect women's interests when it comes to property and raising children, which serves as a form of protection. If one does not plan on staying with someone or having children or making property community, then there is no need to get married. It is important to consider the implications of getting married before doing so. It could help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated, as people could not marry for money or insurance, for example.
1411	Marriage is a business, and the license serves to make it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a form of protection. If you don't plan on staying with someone, or having children, or making property community, there is no need for it. People should think deeply before entering into it, and I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated. People couldn't marry for money, or insurance, etc...
1412	Marriage is essentially a business transaction, and the license is what makes it legal. It exists to protect women's interests in regards to property and raising children, and serves as a form of protection. If someone does not plan on staying with someone, or does not want to have children, or is not looking for a community relationship, there is no need for it. Eliminating the benefits of marriage could help the divorce rate, as people would no longer have a reason to marry for money, or insurance, etc.
1413	Marriage is a contract, and the license serves to make it legally binding. It is there to protect women's rights in regards to property and raising children. It is a form of protection, and it prevents people from entering into a marriage lightly. If the benefits of marriage were eliminated, people could not marry for money, or insurance, etc.
1414	Marriage is an important institution and should be taken seriously. It serves multiple purposes, such as protecting women's interests when it comes to property and raising children. It is a form of protection for those entering the union. If people do not plan on staying with their partner, do not have children, and do not want to make their relationship communal, then there is no need for a marriage license. Eliminating the benefits of marriage could help reduce the divorce rate.  People should really think carefully before marrying someone for money, insurance, or other incentives.  It is important to consider the long-term effects and consequences of marrying someone.
1415	No.  Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in their justice system.   With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.

1425	My school has a policy where, if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must gather in our stadium and wait for police and a bomb squad to arrive. However, a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find out about this and place a bomb in the stadium, leading to the death of the entire student body and staff. It is best to run to my car (off campus) and escape, instead of waiting for the drill. The school will announce whether it is a legitimate threat or not.
1426	Given the fact that a bomb threat could result in the death of the entire student body and staff, it is understandable why you would want to take measures to save your own life. However, your school's policy is to pile up in the stadium until police and a bomb squad arrive. It is likely that the police and bomb squad would take the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of all, so it would be wiser to follow the school's policy in order to ensure safety.
1427	My school has a policy that if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must gather in our stadium and wait for the police and a bomb squad to arrive. Unfortunately, this could be exploited by a smart terrorist, or whomever, who could plant a bomb in said stadium and kill the entire student body and staff. To save lives, it would be better to just run to my car and escape, as it is worth saving my life 100%. The school does inform us if it's a drill or not, which allows you to know the difference between a real threat and a fake one? fake. It would be better off saving my life 100%. The difference between a real threat and a fake one? a fake one?
1428	Given the current school policy of piling everyone in the stadium until police and a bomb squad arrive, a savvy terrorist (or whoever) could easily find out what the school is doing and plant a bomb in the stadium, leading to the potential death of everyone in attendance. It's worth risking my life to try and save everyone. If the school tells us whether or not it's a drill, I can decide what to do depending on the situation.
1429	My school has a policy of gathering the entire school in a stadium and waiting for the police and bomb squad in case of a bomb threat. However, a clever terrorist/individual could easily find out about this policy and plant a bomb in the stadium that would likely lead to the death of everyone in the school. This is a risk that is not worth taking, and it's better to save your life 100% of the time. The school will notify us of a drill that day or not, giving us the necessary information. CMV.

Hunnicutt, however, remained with Hawkeye until the end of the war, and even made sure to check up on their former commander after the war had dragged on, and Hawkeye was starting to lose it. In contrast, Trapper John did not bother to call and check up on them.

1460	You can actually see evolution happen in the laboratory with fruit flies, since they breed, live and die so quickly. Evolution occurs due to mutations, which allow certain creatures to survive better than others, thus falling under the concept of natural selection. Species differentiation is also a clear demonstration of evolution, as different species evolve when they adapt to a slightly different environment. If you observe carefully, you can witness evolution in action.
1461	You can actually observe evolution happening. Fruit flies breed, live, and die quickly, which makes them very useful for this experiment. You need to understand that evolution is driven by mutations and these mutations can give the creatures a better chance to survive. This is known as natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution—different species coming about because they have adapted to a slightly different environment. If you observe carefully, you should be able to witness the process of evolution.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Evolution is a natural process that can be observed in nature.

1462	You can actually observe evolution taking place. Fruit flies make great subjects for this experiment since they breed, live, and die so quickly. Evolution occurs as a result of mutations that give organisms an advantage over others, thereby contributing to natural selection. Additionally, speciation can be seen as two distinct species arising from the same lineage due to different adaptations to an environment. If observed carefully, it is possible to observe evolution in action.
1463	You can actually witness evolution occur. Fruit Flies are excellent for this experiment since they breed, live, and die so quickly. Evolution happens due to mutations, which enable certain creatures to survive because they have provided an advantage over the others. Natural selection is the process by which this selection takes place. Additionally, different species can form through speciation, which is the process in which organisms adapt to a different environment and then create a different species. You can clearly see the differences between similar species and how they adapt to their environment.
1464	You can actually observe evolution happening in front of your eyes. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since they can breed, live, and die quickly. Evolution happens due to mutations that give certain creatures advantages that allow them to survive and reproduce. This is natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution, when two different species emerge because they have adapted to a slightly different environment. If you observe carefully, you can clearly see how evolution occurs.
1465	I believe that marriage is about more than just "love". It's also about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, commitment, tax breaks, parental roles, and other meaningful things. If it was just about "love", then anyone could marry anyone else, like you could marry your dog and two kids at the local middle school could get married as well. It's not only about love.
1466	Is marriage just about "love?" I don't think so. It's about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, commitment, tax breaks, parental roles, and love.

Love and commitment should go hand in hand. It's not just about finding a person to "fall" in love with, it's also about staying in love and committing to that person for the rest of your life. Without commitment, love won't last. It's more than just love. It's about commitment and love. It's about making a lifetime commitment and finding a person to share your life with. It's not just about finding someone to share it with.   It's more than just finding someone to share your life with. It's more than just love. It's not just finding a person to share your life with. It's not just about commitment and example.  It's not just an example
1469	No, marriage is not just about love. It's also about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, and example. It's about commitment and parental roles, and tax breaks can also be beneficial. In addition, two kids at the local middle school cannot get married, as it is illegal. Marriage is more than just love; it involves multiple aspects.
1470	If God is supposedly love, then why does he supposedly hate gays? The Bible is just a book, and it has been interpreted and adapted by humans, who have sometimes changed things to make God look better. Have you ever wondered if the one cardinal who translated it altered some parts?  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument
1471	If God loves everyone, then why does He hate gays? The Bible is just a book, and we must remember that it was translated by humans, who may have changed some things to make God look better. Have you ever wondered if those translators may have put their own spin on certain passages?
1472	If God loves everyone, then why does he hate gays? Furthermore, the Bible is just a book, and we must wonder if the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "God" look good in the eyes of the people.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Hum

1475	The fear of punishment is a powerful deterrent - so much so that I made sure I never did it again after being spanked. The second time is always worse because you know you were already told not to do it.
1476	I learned my lesson after receiving a spanking because I knew that the second time was always worse. The punishment was significantly worse because I had been warned not to do it again. Therefore, I made sure to avoid further punishment by not repeating my actions.
1477	After I received a spanking, I made sure to learn my lesson and avoid getting punished again. The second time around is always worse because you know that the punishment will be even harsher.  So I kept my promise and never did it again.
1478	After receiving a spanking, I made sure I never did it again in order to avoid any further punishment. The second time is always worse because you were told not to do it in the first place.
1479	After being disciplined with a spanking, I made sure not to repeat my actions, so as to avoid any further punishment. The second time is always worse because you know the consequences and the consequences are worse when you know they are coming.
1480	Spanking is mostly done out of frustration, and it can be for more than what the child has done, such as if someone else has made them angry, and they let all their frustration out on the child.
1481	Besides the fact that spanking is often done out of anger and can be for more than what the child has done, such as if someone else has made them mad, it can also cause lasting psychological and emotional damage.
1482	Spanking is often done out of anger and is often used when a child has not done anything to deserve it; for example, if someone else made them angry, they may take their anger out on the child.
1483	Spanking is mostly out of anger, and it can be used for more than what the child has done. For example, if someone else made them angry, they will take it out on the child.
1484	Because spanking is often done out of anger and can be for more than what your child has done—for example, if someone else has made them angry—it can lead to excessive punishments that are not appropriate for the child's behavior.
1485	This does not make sense: you steal a candy bar from school and are disciplined by having your favorite toy stolen. How is this the same thing? You hit someone and are told not to hit, but then told not to hit and then hit by the same person.
1486	This is not fair as it is almost a loophole - you steal a candy bar from school and get punished by your parents taking away your favorite toy. That toy was stolen from you first, but you still get punished for it. This is a situation of "an eye for an eye" which does not make sense. It is like being disciplined for stealing something.
1487	It does not make sense. If someone steals something, they should be disciplined by having something of value taken away from them, not given the same punishment. It's a form of rewarding bad behavior.
1488	This does not make sense: you steal a candy bar from school, then your parents steal your favorite toy. You stole something and were disciplined by having something stolen. That's the same as this: you hit someone, then you get hit. You get told not to hit someone, then not to hit, then hit by the same person.
1489	That type of situation is unfair and unjustified. You should not be punished for your actions if someone else is not held accountable for theirs. It does not make sense for someone to teach a lesson like that.

1495	Some children simply cannot handle the pressure of taking part in a physical education class due to the amount of training they are already putting in for other activities, such as athletics. For example, some children are already training like crazy and cannot take on another rigorous commit
1496	Some children, due to their physical and mental characteristics, cannot handle the pressure of taking on additional extracurricular activities, such as a second sport. For example, some children are already in athletics and are already training very hard.
1497	Some children simply cannot handle the amount of pressure that comes with pe. For example, some are already involved in athletics and they are already training like crazy.
1498	Some kids simply cannot handle the pressure of taking part in PE. For example, some are already involved in athletics and are already training like crazy.
1499	Some children simply cannot handle the physical and mental demands of competitive sports. For example, some children are already involved in athletics and are training like crazy. Thus, it would be unwise to subject them to the added pressure of competitive sports.

1505	There is no requirement to video tape your Field Sobriety Tests. Since most departments don't have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FSTs. Your license is done, and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken the Breathalyser. Then again, people don't usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.

1510	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You would have to prove that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail does not sound good, but since she is in jail, she cannot be doing anything harmful (from the court's point of view). It will be tough to fight this, but you should still talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free (and custody battles can be expensive).
1511	It is very difficult to obtain sole custody. You must prove that the mother is unfit and that she is harming your child in some way. Being in jail doesn't sound great, but since she's incarcerated, it would be difficult for her to do anything detrimental. From the courts' point of view, fighting this will be a challenge. It would be better to try and change the visitation so that it is supervised. Talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free (and custody battles can be costly).
1512	It is very difficult to obtain sole custody. In order to prove that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way, the court requires strong evidence. Being in jail would not seem positive, but since she is in jail, she cannot be doing anything bad. From a legal standpoint, fighting this could be tough. It might be better to attempt to change the visitation. Supervised visitation should be considered for the best outcome. It is wise to go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free (and custody battles can be expensive).

1514	It is very difficult to obtain sole custody. You need to prove to the court that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail could work in your favor, as it indicates that the mother is not able to actively harm her child. A lawyer should be consulted, as the court's opinion is that it will be tough to win sole custody, but a consultation with a lawyer is recommended, as the first one is free and this can be costly.

1530	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure. However, I think that people lie in court all the time.

1545	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred.

1555	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. Those in the pro-choice camp are not necessarily advocating for abortions, but they recognize that a woman should have the right to decide what is best for her. On the other hand, those in the pro-life camp may believe that abortion is morally wrong, but they recognize the need for autonomy over reproductive rights. Both sides of the argument recognize the need for autonomy, but disagree on what should be legal.
1556	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.

1565	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was made to charge fees, the people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would further cripple the poor, and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich will prosper. The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor access other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.

1568	Education should be freely accessible because it is one of the key elements in decreasing poverty. If education had to be paid for, the people in poverty would not be able to afford it, which would further diminish the poor, leaving us in a society where only the middle class and rich can prosper. The lack of access to education will only worsen the situation of those in poverty, as they will be ill-equipped to prevent diseases that plague their society, and lack the resources to help them live better lives. As a society, we should strive to help those less fortunate.

1570	This is an extremely timely and relevant topic. Yes, I think it is plausible that a single incident in one country could cause a ripple effect of reactions all over the world. We have seen this play out in real-time with the reactions to incidents in one country, such as Tianamen Square, which led to a wave of strong opinions in every major country and numerous news reports. In our globalized world, it is nearly impossible to hide incidents like these. I can really see how it might happen.
1571	This is a very interesting topic. Yes, I do think it could reasonably occur. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has. When Tianamen Square happened, there was a reaction in every major country and many news reports. The world is way too open now to try to hide incidents such as these. I can really see how it might happen.
1572	This is an incredibly interesting topic. I can absolutely see how a single incident, like the one in Tiananmen Square, could cause a wave of reaction across the world. Even though governments are trying to keep things secret, it's almost impossible to contain incidents like these. I can definitely see how a single incident could cause a massive chain reaction of events.
1573	Very interesting topic. I think it's possible that something like this could happen in the future. Look at how the reactions to a single incident in one country can cause a ripple effect that is felt in every major country. The world is just too connected and too transparent for any event to be quickly hidden. I can really see how such an event might come to pass.
1574	It is a very interesting topic. Yes, I think it could reasonably happen. The world is too interconnected now to try to hide such incidents.

1595	Having a father who is an alcoholic and beats your mother, who creates violence and terror in the house, is not better than not having a father at all. You always feel ashamed to call that person your father, so it's better to be fatherless.
1596	It is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father. He creates violence and terror in the house and you always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: 'I think global warming is more of an issue of time as we just don't have the technology or time-frame needed to slow down carbon emissions.

1597	It is better to be fatherless because a lousy father can do more harm than good for the family. Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother and creates violence and terror in the house - you would always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who causes more problems than he solves.
1598	Having a father is certainly beneficial to a family, but it is better to be fatherless if you have a lousy father. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and who beats your mother, creating violence and terror in the house, so you always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father like that.
1599	Having a fatherless upbringing can be difficult, but in some cases, it can be better than having an abusive or neglectful father. Growing up without a father can help create independence and resilience in a person, as well as an understanding that the individual cannot rely on their father for support or guidance. It is understandable why some people would choose to have no father figure in their life.

1610	The real issue is why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, and then the government comes back and wants to redefine it.

1615	Gay marriage is against the teachings of the Bible. According to the Judeo-Christian belief, God made man and woman to populate the earth and it is not possible for the human species to survive if people are only attracted to the same sex. Therefore, it is obviously not a good thing.

1622	Gays seem to think that they are special and need to constantly draw attention to themselves, but I believe that it is a result of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakōnesu (it should be a disease).

If you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1624	Gays seem to be trying to make a statement lately by flaunting their sexuality and it's starting to feel a bit like an attention-seeking ploy. I think that they might be a product of overly protective parents, abuse, or even liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). If gays would stop calling attention to themselves, then nobody would really care what they do.
1625	As a Christian, I strongly believe that gay marriage is wrong. This country was founded on Christian values, and we should remain true to those beliefs that have made us what we are today.
1626	I'm an avid Christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond what is acceptable. This country was founded on Christian beliefs and we should abide by them so that we can remain true to our identity and values.
1627	As a devout Christian, I firmly believe that gay marriage is against the beliefs on which this country was founded. We must remain true to our founding beliefs, as they have made us what we are today.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Winter Sports are great for thrill seekers and adventure seekers al
1628	I'm an avid Christian, and I strongly believe that gay marriage is against the teachings of the Bible. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the beliefs used to make us what we are today.
1629	As a Christian, I strongly believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond measure and goes against the core values that this country was founded upon. We must adhere to the Christian beliefs that made this nation great.
1630	In the United States, which seems to be leading the world, it eats less and wastes more. The amount of food that it wastes could be used to feed the entire Indian population. Furthermore, it produces more pollution and then blames us for it! What about that?
1631	It is unfortunate that India is often viewed in such a negative light despite the many positive contributions it makes to the world. America, which is often perceived as leading the world, has its fair share of problems, such as wasting food and producing pollution, despite its economic and military power. This should serve as a reminder that no country is exempt from making changes to be more environmentally friendly and socially responsible.  Furthermore, India's development issues need to be addressed on an individual level rather than making sweeping generalizations about an entire nation.  India is, by no means, a monolithic entity. In sum, America's leadership should be applauded, but not blindly followed. Critiques should be given a thoughtful consideration, and criticism should be
1632	You're saying that only India has these issues, while other countries don't? Does the America, which seems to be leading the world, not have any bad qualities? It wastes less food but produces more pollution and it constantly finds faults with India! What about it?!
1633	From what I know, India is not the only country that has these issues. Other countries around the world also face similar problems, such as America which seems to be leading the world but still has its share of bad qualities. For instance, it produces a lot of food waste which could be used to feed the entire Indian population. Additionally, it also generates a lot of pollution and still manages to blame us for the world's problems! What about it?
1634	You seem to be implying that India is the only country that has these issues, whereas other countries do not. Does the leading nation in the world, the United States, not also have its share of negative qualities? It wastes less food but produces more pollution and then blames India for the problem. What about it?!?!
1635	From my experience as a sibling of three, I believe that spanking should be used as a last resort. I was spanked along with my sister and my younger sister tends to make more mistakes even now that she's 10 than we did.
1636	I believe that corporal punishment should be used as a last resort, at least in my experience with being a sibling of three. I was spanked along with my sister, and I can testify that it was quite effective in disciplining us and helping us learn from our mistakes. On the other hand, our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old.
1637	I believe in using spanking as a last resort, at least, because I, as a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and I turned out to be well-disciplined, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old than we did.
1638	I believe so, as a last resort at least, because I, as a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be well-disciplined. On the other hand, our youngest sister has never been spanked, and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old than we did.   ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: "A house is not a home"  ### Output "A house is not a home"  ### Input: The best way to describe
1639	I believe spanking should be used as a last resort at least, because I, being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she's 10 than we did.
1640	It is okay for parents to spank their children as long as it is not done excessively or with other forms of corporal punishment, such as a belt.
1641	In certain situations, it is OK for a parent to spank their child as long as it is not done too often or with other forms of physical punishment, such as a belt.
1642	It's okay for the parent to spank the child as long as it isn't too often and they do not use other forms of punishment, such as a belt.
1643	I think it's acceptable for a parent to spank their child as long as it's not done too often or with other items like a belt.
1644	It's fine for the parent to spank the child as long as it isn't too often, and they don't use other means like a belt.
1645	Some kids don't learn well through punishment; so why waste your time on that when you can always take away their privileges or reward them with something they value?
1646	Some kids do not learn from being spanked, so it is not a worthwhile approach. Instead, it is better to take away something of value from them, such as a privilege or a reward.
1647	Some kids don't learn effectively through punishment, so why would you waste your time doing that when you can take away something of value from them?
1648	Some kids do not learn from being spanked, so why waste your time on that when you can always take away something of value from them?
1649	Instead of spanking, some kids just don't learn from that kind of discipline. So why waste your time with that when you can always take away something of value from them?
1650	I would turn him in because it's wrong to kill someone. If he can take a life, what stops him from taking other people's loved ones? Everyone deserves to know what happened to their loved ones, and that would give them the justice that the person who committed the act is held accountable for their actions. Love is not worth risking getting caught for not telling what one knows.
1651	I think it is wrong for anyone to take someone's life, and if he can do it once, what stops him from doing it again or even to me? Everyone deserves to know what happened to their loved ones, and justice needs to be served for the person that did it. Love is not worth the risk of getting caught for not reporting it.
1652	I would turn him in because it is wrong to kill someone. If he is capable of taking someone's life, then what stops him from taking mine? Everyone deserves to know what happens to their loved ones, and bringing the perpetrator to justice will give them closure. Love should not come at the cost of you getting caught for not speaking up; it is not worth it.
1653	I would turn him in because it's wrong to take away a life, no matter the reason. If he can commit such an act, it's likely that he would do it again. Everyone deserves to know what happened to their loved ones, and making the perpetrator face the justice system is the only way to give them that peace. Love should not come at the cost of risking getting caught for not speaking up.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: He was later release on a technicality but they said the technicality was that the evidence was not enough. As one person said they had enough evidence and he was guilty and was convicted and they did not
1654	I would turn him in because it is wrong to kill someone. If he is capable of taking one life, what makes it any less likely that he will try to take mine? Everyone deserves justice and the right to know what happened to their loved ones; in this situation, turning him in would bring closure and peace of mind. Love should not come at the risk of getting caught for not telling what you know.
1655	If it was a stranger, I would definitely turn him in because he could be considered a psycho and what if he were to kill me too? But if it was a person that I knew that was harming us, I would have to think about it. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and what if he thinks I will say something and he kills me too. Therefore, it depends on the situation.
1656	If my husband killed a stranger, then yes I would definitely turn him in because he could be considered a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would think about it. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1657	In this situation, it depends on whether you knew the victim or not. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes, I would definitely turn him in since he could be a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would think about it. It's likely that I would turn him in, just to be safe, as well as to protect myself and my family. What if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
1658	In this situation, it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes, I would definitely turn him in because that shows that he is a psycho and what if he then goes on to kill me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would think about it. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and I would also be concerned about the possible repercussions.  It is a difficult situation and I can understand why you might want to protect your husband, but I think that turning him in is the right thing to do.  It is important to consider the risks of not turning him in. It could be dangerous and is why not turn him in. In.
1659	It depends on the situation. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes, I would turn him in because he could be considered a psycho and what if he kills me too. However, if it was a person that I knew and that person was harming us, then I would think about it. It is likely that I would turn him in in order to be safe, as well as to make sure that the person is brought to justice.
1660	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped will get pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can choose to have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people waiting to adopt a child and it's not the child's fault that it was created in such a way. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, because they clearly do not have the experience or knowledge of the situation.

1665	If it proves to be true, assuming we're talking about a reasonably short time frame here, then you're probably okay. It also depends on "how" you say what you say. The facts are one thing, but if you selected a hurtful way of conveying the message, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.

1670	Whether it's President Clinton or President Bush, it's still the same issue. If it was wrong then, it's wrong now. People may argue about a double standard between Democrats and Republicans, but it's wrong either way. People are also forgetting that President Clinton did go to Congress for any wars he got us into, while President Bush did ask Congress for the war he started.
1671	President Clinton faced some of the same issues that are being discussed today, such as an illegal war. Although people may argue it's just politics, it's the same issue. If it's wrong now, it was wrong then. People are also screaming about double standards between Democrats and Republicans, remembering President Clinton asking Congress for any wars but you have President Bush who did go to Congress.
1672	It doesn't matter if it is President Clinton or President Trump - the issue is the same. If it is wrong now, it was wrong then. People are complaining about an "illegal war" but cannot recall President Clinton asking Congress for a war - yet President Bush did go to Congress. So, whatever the President's political party, there is a double standard.
1673	Regardless of people's opinions, it is still wrong for a President to engage in an illegal war. However, people seem to remember President Clinton getting us into wars without going to Congress, while forgetting that President Bush did go to Congress for his wars.
1674	No matter how you look at it, President Clinton's actions were wrong then, just as President Bush's actions are wrong now. Democrats and Republicans have always had a double standard when it comes to politics, and people are right to be outraged about the illegal war. President Clinton did not go to Congress before he ordered the invasion, while President Bush did.
1675	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, yet he himself gets to remain on the bench even though everyone in the town knows that he drinks and drives. Even the lawyers and the police know this and we watched them once when they pulled him over and gave him a ride home, even though we were following. How can one fight such a system?
1676	Yes, most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge not only takes away people's freedom, but places them in jail as well. Even worse, it is common knowledge that he drinks while on the bench. We even saw the police pull him over one night and give him a ride home, and we followed them. How can you fight this kind of injustice?

1680	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property, and the government cannot take it away just because the person is here illegally. However, he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.

1685	If the judge couldn't understand the lawyer clearly, then I believe the judge has every right to ask the woman to remove her veil. If the woman, who is a lawyer, cannot be understood in court due to the presence of her veil, then the judge cannot do their job properly. In Britain, covering your face is seen as suspicious, and these women need to consider the message that the veil puts across.
1686	If the judge could not understand the woman lawyer due to her wearing a veil, then the judge has every right to ask her to remove it. If the lawyer is not doing her job properly due to the presence of the veil, then the judge cannot do his job properly either. I respect the judge for asking for the veil to be removed, as it is not acceptable in Britain where covering your face is seen as suspicious. The women really need to consider the message the veil sends out about them and their religion.   We’re in Britain here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious. These women relly need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion. <noinput>   <noinput>
1687	If the judge couldn't understand the woman's lawyer clearly, then the judge has the right to ask her to take off her veil. The lawyer was not doing her job properly due to the veil and the judge could not do his job properly either. I understand why the judge asked for the veil to be removed, since it is seen as suspicious in Britain, and the woman should think about the message it sends about their religion.
1688	If the judge couldn't understand the lawyer's arguments clearly due to her veil, then the judge has every right to ask her to remove it. In Britain, covering your face is seen as suspicious, so these women need to think about the message their veil sends about their religion.  If they want to express their beliefs, they should do so in a way that shows they respect the laws and culture of the country they're in.
1689	If the judge could not understand the lawyer clearly due to her veil, then the judge has every right to ask the woman to remove it in order to ensure both parties can understand each other. Moreover, the lawyer not doing her job properly is partially the fault of the veil, as it is not meant to be worn in court. I can only respect the judge for asking for the veil to be removed, as it is not very respectful of the woman's religion.
1690	It's not the reaction times — it's the crime itself you're punished for. Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments. So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.

1712	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that as a union guy, our dues are relatively small and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians, when compared to corporations.

1816	It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not to accept their loved one's choice in marriage, but I believe that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves without judgement or criticism.

1830	I don't think the separation of church and state said anything about being tax-exempt. If a minister teaches the Bible, that's one thing, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political views, and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should be subject to the law and lose their tax-exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.

1834	The separation of church and state does not mean that religious organizations are not subject to taxation. However, pastors like Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political views from the pulpit and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should not be allowed to enjoy the tax-exempt status that his organization currently has.

1865	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them comfortable in their current situation, rather than striving to better themselves. This is due to the fact that welfare taxes people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. It also makes people pay for their neighbor's new television and for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day. Welfare is bad!
1866	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them comfortable where they are. This means higher taxes, less spending, and slower business growth. Furthermore, it means that you must pay for your neighbor's new television and for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day. In short, welfare is bad.
1867	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them feel content with their current status. This could lead to them not striving to reach their full potential. Welfare also increases taxes, making people spend less and reduces business growth. It also makes people pay for their neighbor’s new television and for some fat ass that didn’t know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day. Welfare is bad!
1868	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them feel content with their current situation, which reduces the drive to strive for better conditions. Welfare also requires those with higher income to pay more in taxes, which makes it more difficult for them to maintain their current lifestyle and impacts business growth. Additionally, welfare requires those with higher income to pay for their neighbor’s new television, for fat asses that make poor choices in diet and do not know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day, and those that cannot afford to eat at better restaurants and eat healthier. Welfare is bad and only serves to further perpetuate a cycle of poverty and poor choices. It is up to the government to step in and provide more help and solutions that could provide the necessary resources to reduce poverty and provide help and solutions that could provide the necessary resources to reduce
1869	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them comfortable where they are. Welfare means taxing people more and making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television and for the fat person to have access to the same level of living as everyone else. Welfare is bad for the economy, as it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who don't. Welfare also encourages people to rely on it and make them believe that it's normal to receive money from the government. This promotes poverty and keeps people from striving for more.
1870	By choosing where our tax dollars go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, valuable tax dollars don't go towards things that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money can go towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education" so their money can go towards their children's education. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck healthcare. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1871	Through the process of taxation, the government is able to determine which organizations or groups are most important to a certain area. This way, valuable tax dollars are not wasted on irrelevant matters and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would choose "education" so that their money can benefit their children's education. This is an efficient way of prioritizing the use of taxes.
1872	By making sure taxpayers choose which organizations/groups they want their tax dollars to support, the government can ensure the money is spent wisely. This ensures that precious funds are not wasted on something that no one in the area cares about, while more money can be put towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education" so their money can go towards their children's education. Education directly affects the family. If the family never got sick, they would uncheck "health care". This system would prioritize the money more efficiently.
1873	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct.

1874	The government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct by letting people choose which areas they would like their tax money to go to.

1875	I think school uniform is comfortable because there is the gap between the rich and poor. School uniform is efficient in many ways as it prevents teenagers from comparing and feeling conscious about the clothes they wear, which the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive, it is more affordable than buying plain clothes. Additionally, school uniform provides a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I do not need to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1876	I believe that school uniforms have many advantages. Because of the gap between the rich and poor, school uniforms are efficient in many ways. Poor students can be relieved from having to worry about clothing, while the rich can still spend money on branded clothes. Furthermore, school uniforms create a sense of equality among the students. They don't have to worry about what they wear and they all have the same standard. In addition, school uniforms give a sense of belonging and is a cheap and convenient option compared to regular clothing. In my opinion, school uniforms is a great solution and more efficient way.
1877	I believe school uniforms are very comfortable. The gap between the rich and poor can be bridged by school uniforms. Students wear the same clothes so they are concerned about clothes in terms of brand and quantity. Every teenager is sensible and the poor students may feel inferior if they wore plain clothes. Although school uniforms are expensive, it is more cost effective than plain clothes. School uniforms also encourages a sense of kinship, sense of belonging and school identity. In my opinion, school uniforms are more convenient as I don't have to worry about my clothing during my student days.
1878	I believe that school uniform is very comfortable. Because of the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they were allowed to wear their own clothes every day, they would be concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible and the poor students would feel embarrassed. Although school uniform is expensive, it is still cheaper than buying plain clothes. Additionally, they would also feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1879	I think school uniforms are very comfortable. Since there is a gap between the rich and poor, school uniforms are effective in many ways. If students wore plain clothes, they would be concerned about clothing, brands and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so the poor students feel inferior. Although school uniforms are expensive, it is cheaper than purchasing plain clothes. Also, they feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. I do not need to worry about my clothes during my student days.

1915	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The Big Bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know this because nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.

1919	Science can prove that the Big Bang Theory is the origin of life. The Big Bang Theory is a term used to describe the explosion of molecules that marked the beginning of the universe. This explosion led the universe to expand and become cooler, as nearby galaxies are seen to be moving further and further away, and thus the universe must have been hotter and denser in the past. Earth became the perfect location for life due to its "Goldilocks" conditions.

1920	A bad father may be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he can teach you what not to do, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all, I think. He could toughen you up. Also, you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.  // end of the output //
1921	A lousy father may be able to teach you more than no one at all. He may be able to teach you what not to do, how not to act, how not to treat your family. This is better than no teaching at all, I think. He could toughen you up, and you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy; you already know.  This can be a valuable life lesson.  In the end, it's up to you to make the decision as to whether or not his teaching is beneficial or not.
1922	A poor father may be able to teach you more than no one at all. He might be able to teach you what not to do, how not to act, and how not to treat your family. In this way, it is better than no teaching at all, don't you think? He could toughen you up and you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy. You already know.
1923	Having a lousy father can teach you valuable lessons about how not to act and treat people, and you will at least have the knowledge that he was a real person and not some idealized version of a father. You can use this knowledge to make sure you will never make the same mistakes as your father.
1924	Having a lousy father can be beneficial in a way, as it can teach you what not to be like and how not to treat your family. You will still know who he was and will not wonder if he was a saint or not. Having no father can also be beneficial, as you will not be influenced by his behavior and can instead be taught what to do and not to do in life. Knowing who your father is can help you better understand yourself, as you'll understand your inherited characteristics. Knowing nothing can leave you vulnerable to making the same mistakes. Ultimately, it depends on the individual circumstance.

1935	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just do not hold much ground (with the exception of one or two, and these are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1936	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence, which make it difficult to believe in its teachings written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe. These arguments for Christianity do not hold much ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is the more rational position of the two.

1938	Christianity contradicts historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe, contain numerous contradictions. The arguments for Christianity simply do not hold up (with the exception of one or two, but these are weak). Atheism is the more logical position of the two.
1939	Christianity conflicts with a vast array of evidence, from historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other sources. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity, while not entirely void of merit, do not stand up to objective scrutiny. Atheism is the more reasonable position to take, of the two options.
1940	No one has ever said that science is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science; science is willing to admit that it does not have all the answers, whereas religion is so dogmatic that it does not even recognize facts. Even when it comes to what truth truly stands for, religion is often wrong.
1941	No one has ever said science is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science - science is open-minded and realizes that it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is too dogmatic and rigid to accept facts and the truth. Even what "truth" really stands for.

1948	Yes, because that way the child will learn the consequences of their actions and not repeat them. I know this from experience.
1949	If a child knows the consequences of their actions, they are less likely to repeat them. This is something I have seen from my own experience.
1950	I believe that spanking a child is appropriate only when they know they have done something wrong. The child will understand more if they are scared of repeating the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1951	I believe that spanking a child is necessary, but it should only be done when they know they have done something wrong. The child will understand more if they are afraid of repeating the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1952	I believe that you should spank a child only when they understand the consequences of their actions. This will make them realize the severity of their actions and deter them from making the same mistake again. Actions speak louder than words.
1953	I believe that spanking a child is necessary only when they understand the consequences of their actions. The child should be scared of repeating the same mistake so that he or she will understand the gravity of their wrongdoings. Actions speak louder than words.
1954	I believe that you should spank a child only when they know they have done wrong. The child will understand more if they are scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1955	I don't think that spanking should be necessary; it would only last for a minute, but punishing could last anywhere from two to three weeks, or even more.
1956	I don't think that spanking should be the only form of discipline; punishing can last up to two or three weeks or even more. However, that can be much longer than just a minute, and that can have lasting psychological and emotional effects on the child. Therefore, more constructive methods should be used instead, such as verbal guidance and logical reasoning.
1957	Spanking may be unpleasant, but it usually only lasts for a few moments. On the other hand, punishing a child can last for two or three weeks, or even longer. That's why I think that punishment is a much more effective way of disciplining than spanking.

1960	I would say yes to some circumstances, such as if my spouse killed a person out of self-defence or defence of another person. I would not turn them in in this case. Another circumstance I would say no to, such as if they killed a person for money, objects, or simply because they disliked someone; in this case, I would not turn them in. If, however, they killed cold-heartedly, such as in the case of rape, then yes, I would turn them in.
1961	If it's in self defense or defense of another person, I would say yes. However, if it's for money, objects, or for a pure dislike of someone, then no, I would not turn them in. If someone is that cold-blooded and could kill without remorse, then yes, I would turn them in.
1962	I understand both sides and I would say that if my spouse killed a person out of self-defense or to defend another person, I would not turn them in. On the other hand, if they killed someone for money, objects, or out of a pure dislike for the individual, then I would turn them in because somebody that cold-hearted could potentially harm me.
1963	I would say yes to some circumstances, such as if it was self-defence or defending another person. I don't believe in revenge or harming another person, but if it was a situation of protecting oneself or another person, then yes, I would turn them in. Another circumstance could be if it was in defence of an animal or an object, then no, I would not turn them in. If they killed someone for money, objects, or just pure hatred towards someone, then yes, I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill again.
1964	In some instances, I would say yes; in other instances, I would say no. If my spouse was defending themselves or another person, I would not turn them in. If they were defending an animal, I would also not turn them in. In addition, if they killed someone in self-defense, I would not turn them in either. However, if someone killed another person for rape, money, objects, or if they had a pure dislike for a person, then I would turn them in.

1969	The Declaration of Independence states that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
1970	I think it may have something to do with the fact that, for some people, the human brain may not be fully developed until the age of 18, which increases the risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol consumption. Whether this is true or not, it appears to be a common excuse for the age limit. I personally believe that if a person is old enough to die for their country, they should also be old enough to drink.
1971	I think there could be some truth to the fact that the development of the human brain may not be complete in people aged 18, as it poses a risk of more serious damage being caused by alcohol. Whether this is the case or not, it seems to be a commonly used excuse for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if someone is old enough to die for their country, then they should also be old enough to have a drink.
1972	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that, for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete until the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused by alcohol consumption at 18 years old. Whether this is true or not, it appears to be a common justification for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if someone is old enough to die for their country, they should also be old enough to have a drink.
1973	I believe that it might have something to do with the fact that, for some people, the development of the human brain is not completed by the age of 18, which could pose a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether or not this is true, it appears to be a commonly used excuse for the current drinking age. I personally believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, then they should be old enough to have a drink.
1974	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that, for some people, the development of the human brain is not yet complete at the age of 18, which increases the risk of serious damage caused by alcohol consumption. Whether this is true or not, it appears to be a common justification for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, then they should also be old enough to drink.
1975	All of them. That's why it's called rape. If it weren't rape, there would be nothing to take to court. Regardless of individual court cases, the question is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. There is a fine line, however, in cases of statutory rape, in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated the sexual relations. Of this I'm not aware of any specific court cases.
1976	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it weren't rape, then there would be nothing to bring to court. Regardless of individual court cases, the key is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not.

1977	All of them. That's why it is called rape. Regardless of individual court cases, the key is whether or not the courts are correctly convicting the true rapist or not. One fine line may be that of statutory rape in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
1978	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to do with the evidence and the accused would not be prosecuted. Regardless of individual court cases, the main issue is whether or not the courts are convicting the right person or not. One fine line, however, is that of statutory rape in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
1979	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not.

1985	If cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and health. Hospitals would see a decrease in patients with cigarette-induced cancer, which is a great benefit to our healthcare system. Additionally, the cigarette industry deserves to crash. I would love to see that day, as all those sleazeballs selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers and medics and firefighters deserve better. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1986	If cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. Hospitals wouldn't have to treat patients with cigarette-induced cancer and money wouldn't be lost from the economy.

Those who support cigarette legality are losers.
1987	If cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and health. Hospitals would be relieved of the thousands of patients with cancer caused by cigarettes. The tobacco industry deserves to go down, and I would love to see that day. Those of you who support the legalization of cigarettes are wrong.
1988	In response to another person's argument, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and prevent untold amounts of suffering. It would also save hospitals from having to treat patients with cigarette-induced diseases. Additionally, the cigarette industry deserves to go down in flames. I would love to see that day.

1990	I believe that Brown v. Board of Education, which marked a victory for the integration of education in America, was successful in beginning the process of intergrating the entire nation, not just the educational system. At the same time, I believe the spirit of the law is still lacking due to the existing geographical and financial inequalities between schools of different communities, with some being more wealthy and some more poor, becoming an argument that the system is not seperate but still unequal due to the inability to fund the communities, with some being more wealthy, becoming an argument that the recent arguement that the system is not seperate but still unequal due to the existing inequal due to the recent arguement that the same argument that the argument that the instruction on how to make sure the instruction that argument that the instruction for the instruction on how to complete argument that has a potential response to assistance on how to complete the argument that instruction.

1991	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly, Brown v. Board of Education was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, not just in the education system. However, when it comes to the spirit of the law, I believe it's still lacking due to the geographical and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor, mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is not separate but still unequal due to the ability of people making the California charles county name that instruction for Evolution for how to edit instructions for how the answer, charles county sher response to the correction task should show the output task-generated output explanation of the answer and inference.

1992	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Brown v. Board of Education was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but separate". However, when looking at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not only with the ability to fund their local schools in wealthy, mostly due to third-party providing specific input and outputs related specific information on what the input for the outcome.
1993	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was successful in breaking down the "separate but equal" mentality that had been in place previously, as it ordered schools to desegregate and began the integration of the whole of America. However, when looking at the spirit of the law, it's still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion between schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban ones, is a problem that we still haven't dealt with. one can easily make an arguement that the system is now not separate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local communities to make an arguement for contextual clues were looking at the input to complete the context-specific feedback loopback task and the input task should be completed task to be sure task output which response to the desired feedback response to the contextualizes the output task.

The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor, mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem that has yet to be dealt with. An arguement can be made that the system is not separate, but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not just in education system. Brown v.

2005	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. For example, Guantanamo was an excellent example. While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured. However, the UN is using the accusation to bash the US. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. So, if you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture.  finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.

2006	Before you begin writing your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The press often exaggerates issues to sell papers, as evidenced by the Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversy. Although the inmates were humiliated, they were not tortured. The UN has declared that force-feeding prisoners on hunger strike is torture, while not feeding them is also torture. Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment for the same reason - it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.
2007	It is important to make sure that you have the facts before you write your paper. The press often exaggerates the issues and can be misleading. For example, Guantanamo Bay was controversial and exaggerations of the situation were reported. The UN is using this to bash the US and force-feeding prisoners going on a hunger strike. Additionally, the UN has determined that the prisoners starving is torture. If you don't feed them, it's torture. If you don't feed them, it's torture.
2008	To make sure that your paper is accurate, you should make sure that you have the correct facts. The media tends to sensationalize events, like Guantanamo Bay, to draw in more viewers and readers. This is an example of an exaggeration, as the UN uses the accusation to bash the US. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. If you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture.                                                                           answers the structure       The input
2009	It is important to consider both sides of an issue before writing a paper. Make sure that you have the facts, such as whether force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. If you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture. Additionally, the UN has determined that it's torture. Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.
2010	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and have discovered that they have a much lower tax rate than the US. Additionally, they have heavy luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-named clothing, which is causing many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia. The high tax burden in certain European countries is causing an exodus, which is benefitting countries such as Dubai and Singapore. MNCs have been doing it for years, and individuals are starting to take advantage of this as well.
2011	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and I've discovered that they have a flat tax rate that is much lower than the US, and they have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and designer clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia due to the tax burden becoming too high, especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which causes a loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefitting greatly from this. MNCs have been doing it for years, and individuals are starting to move as well.

Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia due to this tax burden. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries, leading to a loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from this situation. MNCs have been doing it for years, and individuals are beginning to follow suit.
2013	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have a much lower tax rate than the US. In addition, they impose heavy taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This is causing many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia due to the burdensome tax rates in certain countries. This exodus of people from certain countries could be detrimental to those nations' tax base, as MNCs and individuals have been taking advantage of these tax challenges to relocate to tax havens such as Dubai and Singapore.
2014	In light of the rising taxes in mature economies, individuals and multinational corporations alike are seeking alternatives. Singapore stands out among other destinations with its low tax rate and attractive conditions. This has led to a massive influx of people seeking a better life. This phenomenon has been addressed by the move to Singapore and other locations with better taxation policies. In a way, this is what the European countries are facing; a taxation burden exodus from certain countries which leads to loss of tax income in the short-term but it eventually leads to greater economic growth in the long-term.

2015	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my high school only had three AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. This way, students can have a better chance of understanding what is going on. The students that are exceeding can be placed in higher classes, while those that are not as advanced can take a lower level class.  I don't mean that students should be put in different grades, only that students may need to go to an easier class.

2025	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life. If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that the probability at all. My point is that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.

2030	Wilson's "Kentucky Fried" accent in The Life Aquatic pales in comparison to his brother Luke's hilarious suicide scene in Royal Tenenbaums. It's even made funnier with the song "Needle in the Hay" playing in the background. The funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie is the scene in Bottle Rocket where the character of "Future Man" says, "You look like a banana."
2031	Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried Accent fluctuates throughout the movie, but it's still less interesting than Luke Wilson's suicide scene in The Royal Tenenbaums. Additionally, the death scene in The Life Aquatic is pale in comparison to the ending of Rushmore. The 15 seconds of pure gold is when Future Man says "You look like a banana," in Bottle Rocket.
2032	It's not even close. Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried Accent goes in and out throughout the whole movie, and the death scene in The Life Aquatic pales in comparison to Luke Wilson's suicide scene in Rushmore. It helps that Needle in the Hay is playing, and the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie (excluding Future Man "You look like a banana" in Bottle Rocket).  The tennis scene is the funniest.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.  It is easily the highlight of Rushmore.
2033	Wes Anderson's films are full of strange and memorable characters and moments. The most memorable scene of Rushmore is definitely the death scene, where Max Fischer (played by Jason Schwartzman) attempts suicide. Meanwhile, Luke Wilson's suicide scene in the Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is equally as powerful. The scene is played out to the tune of "Needle in the Hay" by Elliott Smith, and the emotions portrayed in the scene are contrasted with a feeling of hope. Additionally, the movie is set in the ocean, making the scene all the more powerful. Lastly, the scene goes seamlessly with the movie, as it's concluded with the playing of music. With the death scene of Luke Wilson in Rushmore goes back and forth between two contrasting emotions of the Wilson's death scene of Max and Luke Wilson's character's
2034	Wes Anderson's films are full of memorable moments. In The Life Aquatic, the suicide scene with Luke Wilson is particularly powerful. On the other hand, Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried accent comes and goes throughout the movie, and the scene in which it is the most prevalent is when he sings "Talking Heads" in the restaurant. Finally, the last 15 seconds of the movie, with the tennis scene, is the funniest part of the movie, minus the "you look like a banana" scene in Bottle Rocket.
2035	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2036	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired, while a chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in a circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2037	Given the densely packed zombie population on this block, I would choose the chainsaw. I would go down the block while swinging the chainsaw in a circular motion: a spinning circle of undead carnage. Although if there are only few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of range.
2038	Assuming the zombie population is densely packed, I would choose the chainsaw. It is much more effective than a shotgun, as it does not require loading and firing, and is able to continuously run. Thus, I would be able to go down the block while spinning in a circle of undead carnage. Furthermore, a shotgun would have the disadvantage of not having the ability to travel long distances, as it requires loading and firing.
2039	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw.

2045	This is way too much of a blanket assertion; just being a "dictator" is no reason to eliminate someone, much less permanently. Who determines who is a dictator? Assassinating a leader assumes that the world agrees the nation's leader is a dictator; however, there have been both evil and benign dictators.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Don't forget the permantely eliminate option! This is way too much of a blanket assertion, just being a "dictator" is no reason to dispose of, muche less permantely eliminate a so called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator; however
2046	This blanket statement that all dictators must be removed is too extreme. Who gets to determine if a leader is a dictator? Once the world agrees a leader is a dictator, should assassination or other drastic measures be taken against them? There have been both good and bad non-dictators, so making such a blanket assertion is too simplistic.  The determination of who is a dictator and who isn't should be left to the judgement of the people affected by the situation.  It's not right to judge each nation's situation with a blanket statement like this.  Ultimately, each nation must decide for itself.  There's no easy solution or policy that's best for every situation, and it's too extreme to try and remove all dictators globally.  If a dictatorship is too extreme for
2047	This blanket assertion that all dictators must be removed is too harsh. Who is to determine which leaders are dictators and which ones are not? Even if the world agrees that a certain leader is a dictator, should they still be assassinated or overthrown? There have been both good and bad non-dictators, and it's not fair to assume all dictators must be removed.
2048	This is far too sweeping a generalization to simply label a leader a dictator and assume the world agrees, let alone to assassinate them. Who decides if a leader is a dictator and why? There have been both benevolent and malevolent leaders who were not dictators, so such a blanket statement is too simplistic.
2049	This is far too broad of an assertion; simply being a "dictator" is not reason enough to dispose of or permanently eliminate a so-called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why assassinate him/her? There have been "benign" dictators just as there have been evil non-dictators.

2075	I don't want to say that I officially have a position, but I want someone on the other side to answer this because I honestly just don't know. If a 14-year-old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? Is it then pro-life to have an abortion? I just don't know and I want an answer from someone on the other side.
2076	If a 14-year-old is raped and becomes pregnant, then dies if she has the baby, the pro-life decision is to have an abortion. This is because saving the life of the mother takes priority, and abortion is the only way to ensure that.
2077	If a 14-year-old is raped and gets pregnant, it is indeed a difficult situation. In such cases, it is important to consider the needs of the minor and do what is best for her. If the minor wants to continue the pregnancy, she should have the option to do so, and a pro-life stance would be to provide her with the necessary resources and support. If the minor does not want to continue the pregnancy, an abortion should be an option as well. Ultimately, the pro-life stance would be to ensure the minor's wellbeing and provide her with the resources to give her the best option for her.

2085	I believe this policy is beneficial. It eliminates fashion competitiveness among students and helps them focus on their studies since they no longer need to worry about the most expensive clothing or looking the coolest. In addition, it can make all students feel more equal and inclusive, which can lead to an increase in their academic performance.
2086	I believe that uniforms are a great idea! This way, girls will not tease each other about fashion issues, and it will also make all students feel equal and concentrate more on their studies since they won't have to worry about being the coolest or the prettiest.

2100	Yes, it may be necessary to spank a child sometimes, although it is not the ideal form of discipline, in order to make them understand that their behavior is wrong and that they need to change it. One should be mindful not to overdo it or use corporal punishment excessively.
2101	Yes, it is true that there are other ways to discipline children, but sometimes a little spanking might be necessary to make them understand that their actions were wrong. Do not overdo it, though; spanking for no reason is not acceptable.
2102	Yes, although there are many other ways to discipline children, sometimes a little spanking is necessary in order to make them understand that their actions were wrong and to help them learn their lesson. This should not be done excessively, however, as that is bad.
2103	Yes, spanking can be an effective way of disciplining children, especially when other methods do not seem to work. However, it should not be done without reason and in excess.
2104	Yes, it is true that corporal punishment may be necessary in certain cases to make a child understand that their actions are wrong and that there are consequences. However, it should not be used excessively and only as a last resort.

2106	I would not allow my child to use social media until they are old enough to understand the implications and dangers of doing so.

2111	No, spanking should not be used because it might negatively affect the relationship between the child and parents. Children may also pick up on the parents' aggressive attitude and learn that violence is an acceptable way to solve problems. There are better ways to deal with conflicts, such as using other techniques.
2112	No, spanking should not be used because it can damage the relationship between the child and parents. Also, children can pick up on the parents' violent attitude and learn that it is acceptable to use aggression as a form of solving problems. There are better ways to handle conflicts, such as using other techniques.
2113	No, spanking might lead to negative consequences. It can affect the relationship between the child and parents, and children might learn aggression from seeing their parents act violently. There are better ways to solve problems, such as using other techniques.
2114	No, because spanking might have negative effects on the relationship between the child and parents. Children are likely to pick up on the parents' violent attitude, and there are better ways to solve problems, such as using other techniques.

If you can do the job and do it well, I don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. Just do the darn job and get paid.
2140	No, definitely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. You're better off wearing your seatbelt, not drinking or smoking, exercising five times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors? Thank God we haven't reached a point in this country where everything that you should do you must do under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
2141	I agree that it would be unwise to take such a law to the extreme, as it would be wrong for the government to force citizens to do anything they should do anyway, like wearing a seatbelt or following common-sense safety rules. But I still think the government should legislate in order to protect citizens from harm and potential danger. I think that wearing a helmet while riding a bike is a good example of this; even though it is something sensible people should do anyway, the government should still make it law. It's not about coercing anyone but rather about protecting citizens from danger and potential injury.

2142	Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. You are better off wearing your seatbelt, not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors. Thank God we haven't reached a point in this country where EVERYTHING that you SHOULD do you MUST under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
2143	I do not agree with such a law. It is the first step towards a totalitarian government that micromanages citizens' lives. I much prefer the freedom of making personal decisions, like wearing a seatbelt or not. You are better off exercising your own judgement, such as not drinking or smoking. Of course, you must respect the law and be aware of the potential consequences.
2144	Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors. We still have rights in this country, right?
2145	I disagree because, well, I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one! I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me what I have worked for! Me and my brother were the only white kids in the projects... Talk about unfair! Take your cry for reparations to someone else. I simply don't buy it!

2147	I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one! I will fight tooth and nail for what I have worked so hard for. My brother and I were also the only white kids in the projects; that didn't seem fair either. Take your call for reparations to someone else. I simply don't buy it.
2148	I disagree because, well, I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one! I will defend what I have worked for and will walk away from anyone who tries to take it. Furthermore, I understand how unfair it was for my brother and I to be the only white kids in the projects. However, I do not believe that it is my responsibility to give in to your demands for reparations. Good day.

2155	You can be a kind, compassionate person, but bad things will still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole, and still be successful. People in life who are successful usually take what they want and play to win. I see it everywhere — employers or bosses who treat people like shit but are financially successful. People who do right by others sometimes, but get nothing in return.

People who are successful often take what they want and play to win, regardless of how others might perceive it. I see it everywhere, with employers or bosses who treat people poorly but still attain financial success. In life, fairness would treat innocent people with kid gloves in prison, hard work pays off for doing right.
2158	People can be kind, compassionate and still experience bad things in life. Conversely, one can lead a selfish, unethical life and still be successful, as people tend to take what they want and play to win in order to achieve that success. However, I see it often that life is not fair and innocent people go to prison, hard working people get ahead but good people do not get the reward they deserve.  I don't like it and I see it often too.
2159	You can be a kind and compassionate person, but bad things will still happen to you, as life is not fair. Conversely, you can choose to be a selfish and successful person and still take what you want and play to win. People who chose this path are often successful since they are not necessarily concerned about others, but only themselves. You often see this behaviour in employers or bosses that treat some people shitty, but they are successful financially. People who do right by others, but get nothing in return.  It is a sad truth and does not help.
2160	Most people, most of the time, rather than forming an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However, most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine."

2165	Hope that did not come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. I was talking to my parents who are both very religious, and I realized that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem with religion is that it hinders the progress of society, specifically with issues concerning advancements in science, such as climate change and evolution, as well as with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
2166	I hope that I didn't come across as too crazy or confusing. My point was that while religion contributes to wars, it also prevents the spread of progress in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology. Additionally, it hinders social progress, specifically with issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.  All in all, I think that the harm that religion causes is greater than what it contributes, and it is high time for a more secular worldview.

2168	Hope that came out as clearly and correctly as possible. My point is that while religion does contribute to wars, the greater issue is that it impedes the progress of scientific advancement in areas such as medicine, climate change, and biology, as well as societal progress in regards to topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc. This is an issue that must be addressed.
2169	I hope that did not come out too crazy sounding or confusing. I was discussing with my parents, who are both very religious, and I realized that while religion does contribute to wars, the main problem is that it prevents progress in many scientific fields, specifically in the areas of medicine, climate change, and biology. Additionally, it restricts society's progress in areas such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana, among other things.
2170	In my opinion, the Conservatives are all a bunch of selfish money-hording bastards who don't care about anyone but themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education, and now we have this woman, who also voted against gay marriage, but who is highly in favour of a number of things that will benefit the rich and wealthy, such as academies and further raising of tuition fees. We may even see it get worse.
2171	In my opinion, the Tories are a bunch of selfish, money-hording bastards who do not care about anyone but themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education, and the same is true of the current "women and equality" minister, who also voted against gay marriage. This person is highly supportive of a number of measures that will only benefit the rich and wealthy, like academies and higher tuition fees. We could see this become even worse than before.
2172	In my opinion, the Tories are a bunch of selfish money-hoarding bastards who don't care about anyone but themselves. Gove was an absolute nightmare for education, and now we have this woman, whose previous title was minister for women and equality, but who also voted against same-sex marriage. She's highly in favor of a number of things that will only benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (such as academies and raising tuition fees even further). We may even see it get worse.

2174	In my opinion, the Tories are just a bunch of selfish, money-hoarding bastards who don't care about anyone but themselves. Gove was an absolute disaster for education, and now we have this woman, who also voted against gay marriage and is highly in favor of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy, such as academies and higher tuition fees. Things may even get worse.
2175	Neither one of these two Italian crooners was really all that gifted when it came to singing. Dino had the better voice, more range and better tone.

2180	We are just people at the end of the day and if no one likes same sex relationships, it's their problem. I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone, so what's the big deal?

2185	I had a really bad experience here. The place was not very busy, but everything was still slow. The staff seemed overwhelmed and the food was not good when I got it an hour later. I would advise against ordering the mushroom stroganoff; the sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were too tough to chew. We had a group of 12 people in the patio, and it was not a good time.

Do yourself a favor and skip it.
2188	My experience at the restaurant was quite unsatisfactory. The place wasn't too busy, but the food was still slow, probably due to the overworked staff. The mushroom stroganoff was inedible.

2189	My experience at this restaurant was not very pleasant. It was relatively busy, but everything was slow. The staff seemed overwhelmed and the food took one hour to be ready.

We had a group of 12 people in the patio, but it was not enjoyable due to the slowness of service and lack of quality of the food. Don't order the mushroom stroganoff - it was not edible.
