75	Growing up without a father or any fatherly interaction during the essential early years can have an impact on a child's development, but it is possible to thrive despite this. I was raised in a similar situation and have had success, despite the lack of a father figure in my life. I believe that the fatherly influence is not necessary for success, but rather the support of male role models can be beneficial.
76	I understand that having a father figure can be important for a child's development, but I have still been successful in life despite living without a father for the first thirteen years. It is possible to grow up fatherless and still become successful. I believe it is possible to achieve success without the influence of a father during these formative years.
77	Honestly, I believe that having a father can be beneficial for a child, but I have still been successful without one. My father was absent during my early years, but I was still able to turn out okay. Everyone is different, but I believe it is possible to grow up fatherless and still be successful.

105	That's interesting, as the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim that evolution continues. I have not personally noticed human evolution over the last few thousand years, although fossil records indicate that humans have evolved over time. As for the Big Bang theory, it suggests that everything was condensed from a single hot gas, which then cooled and expanded. This enabled the formation of galaxies and the universe as we know it.
106	That's interesting, as the burden of proof lies on the scientist to show that humans are still evolving. While it is possible that we have evolved over time, it is difficult to determine without more evidence. With regards to the 'Big Bang' theory, it is possible that everything came together instead of apart due to gravitational forces.
107	That's interesting, but I believe that evolution is a gradual process that has taken place over a long period of time. It is difficult to definitively determine exactly how human evolution has changed over time, but genetic evidence suggests that we have evolved over the years. Furthermore, the ‘Big Bang’ theory suggests that everything came together after the initial explosion.
108	That's interesting, as the burden of proof lies with me to show that humans are still evolving. I believe we have evolved in various ways over time, such as with our culture and technology, although it may not be immediately noticeable.  The Big Bang theory states that the universe expanded from a single, hotter state in the past, allowing galaxies and stars to form. This is in contrast to the idea that everything would have been scattered in the initial explosion, which could have inhibited further growth.
109	That's interesting, however, I believe the burden of proof lies with scientists to demonstrate that humans are still evolving. I also question the concept of evolution being linked to physical changes alone; evolution can occur in many forms, such as changes in the environment that allow certain species to adapt and survive. This is something that scientists need to take into account when exploring the concept of evolution.  In terms of the Big Bang theory, it is possible that everything expanded rapidly from a single point and subsequently cooled and contracted, allowing for the formation of structures and elements.
110	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has its own intricate design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer, do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.
111	As a nurse, the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies.

Evolutionary theories require a greater leap of faith than Creationism.
115	Although I voted for evolution, I think creation is more acceptable due to the fact that someone, at some point, had to alter aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
116	Although I voted for evolution, I believe creation is a more acceptable theory as it suggests that someone or something caused changes to the universe which allowed for our existence.
117	Although I voted for evolution, I believe creation is a more acceptable theory to me because it states that someone or something had to alter the universe to enable our existence.
118	Although I voted for evolution, I believe that creation is a more acceptable theory because it offers the idea that someone or something inserted changes into the universe to enable our existence.
119	Although I voted for evolution, I think creation is more acceptable because it is easier to believe that someone, or some higher power, intervened in the universe to enable our existence.
120	Accepting evolution, as proposed by Darwin, is like accepting that a puzzle can be solved through natural processes, as the pieces have the potential to fit together over time due to natural selection.
121	Accepting evolution, as outlined by Charles Darwin, is like accepting that a puzzle can be solved by making various changes to the gene pool over multiple generations, as two genes coming together can create a new gene that is better adapted to its environment.
122	Believing in Darwin's theory of evolution is like believing that the pieces of a puzzle can be fitted together through natural selection, which provides some stability for a species over time.
123	The theory of evolution provides a plausible explanation for the origin of species that is based on the concept of natural selection, which states that organisms with beneficial traits have a higher chance of survival and reproduction. This process, over time, can lead to the formation of new species.
124	Believing in evolution can provide a unifying explanation for the diversity of life on earth that is grounded in scientific evidence. This evolutionary process is an ongoing process that is shaped by natural selection over time.

273	Water bottles made from plastic are essential for providing access to safe and reliable sources of water. Without plastic water bottles, it would be much more difficult to access clean water, resulting in a greater risk of diseases caused by consuming contaminated water.
274	Without plastic water bottles, we would not have access to clean water, which is essential for survival. Without access to clean water, we would be subject to water-borne illnesses, which can be life-threatening.
275	Given the current economic climate, prohibiting the use of single-use plastics such as water bottles may not be feasible until we are able to gain more economic stability.
276	We should prioritize using reusable water bottles and other items over single-use items in order to reduce our environmental footprint and save money during this recession.
277	We will be able to phase out single-use plastic water bottles when the economy improves; in the meantime, we must look for more sustainable alternatives to reduce our plastic footprint.
278	We may need to impose restrictions on the use of single-use plastics, such as water bottles, until we are able to overcome this recession.
279	We will not be able to completely eliminate single-use plastics such as water bottles until we are able to make further strides in alternatives, such as recycled materials, during this recession.
280	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called “civil unions”. Further, the effects on society are bound to be minimal if any changes are made to the legal structure of these unions. Finally, challenging existing assumptions can provide valuable insight into how different scenarios may play out in reality.
281	This idea may have benefits, but the effects on society could be significantly different than what we expect. Allowing gay couples to legally marry could help define their relationships more clearly and provide more rights and protections than civil unions. If challenged, the assumptions underlying the law could be modified to better reflect the new situation.
282	I believe that the legal structure of marriage should reflect the unique nature of marriage between two partners of the same sex, while providing minimal social and legal impact. Civil unions can provide this while still respecting the existing legal framework.
283	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called “civil unions”.  Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal, especially when compared to the potential impact of introducing same-sex marriage, which could drastically alter social norms and policies. While I recognise that law may change, it is important to consider the long-term implications of such changes and ensure that the initial assumptions are appropriate for the new scenario.
284	Allowing homosexual relationships to have separate legal recognition can have positive effects on society, particularly with respect to providing stability and legal protection to the partners in these relationships. This can have a significant impact on society, although the extent of this impact depends on the specifics of the legal recognition.
285	Marriage is between a man and a woman, and this is the legal standard that should be upheld to ensure the stability of marriage as an institution.
286	Marriage is a legal and social institution between a man and a woman. It is not possible for two people of the same gender to marry legally in most jurisdictions.
287	Marriage is the legal and social union of two people, typically between a man and a woman, which brings both legal and social benefits. Same-sex relationships and couples are not legally recognized as marriages.
288	Marriage is between a man and a woman and has traditionally been defined as a union between a man and a woman. Same-sex unions may have similar rights and benefits as marriage, but these are decided by legislation and not necessarily the same across countries and jurisdictions.
289	Given the cultural and legal differences between couples, marriage should be defined as a union between two people of different gender identities, which enables both partners to equally benefit from legal, financial, and social protection.
290	I am an American, and I believe India has great potential due to its lower levels of poverty compared to the United States. India was able to develop its education system quickly, which gives me hope that India will be more competitive in the future. India has the potential to excel when everyone has access to education, which could happen in our lifetime.
291	I am an American, and I am proud to say that the United States has become a leading economic power largely due to the advancements made possible by generations of hard work and innovation. India was once wealthier than the US due to its lack of slavery, but the British ultimately limited India's growth when they colonized the nation. However, India has the potential to excel in the coming years, as access to education becomes more widespread.
292	I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit that the United States' wealth is largely a result of slavery. India never had slavery and was once much more affluent than the US, but it took longer for India to develop educationally. India now has potential to excel in education, which may happen in our lifetime.
293	I am an American and while India has made significant progress in recent decades, America has many strengths in education that have allowed us to develop more quickly. India is certainly competitive in terms of education but I believe that America will eventually catch up, especially as education becomes more accessible to the general population.
294	I am an American, and while India has grown significantly in recent years, the United States has benefited from greater access to education, which has allowed us to develop more quickly. India has the potential to be competitive in education and excel in the future, as access to education increases.
295	India is a secular state, and people from a variety of communities reside here, giving it an understanding of different cultures and ways of life. This allows India to lead all the people of the world without causing any annoyance to anyone.
296	India is a secular state, which means that people of multiple communities reside here, allowing India to have knowledge of various cultures and ways of life. This enables India to lead all people of the world without creating any issues or tension among them.
297	India is a secular state and, as a result, people of all communities live here, giving it an understanding of various cultures and lifestyles. This allows India to lead all people in the world without creating any issues among the different communities.
298	India is a secular state, and people of various communities live here, which gives India an understanding of different cultures and ways of life. This enables India to lead all people of the world without creating any unnecessary tension among the people of different countries.
299	India is a secular state and people of all communities live here, giving it an understanding of different cultures and lifestyles. This enables India to lead the people of the world without creating any issues.
300	India has the potential to lead the world in many areas, including economic development and technological innovation. India has many resources which can be leveraged to achieve global leadership, such as its educated workforce and its diverse culture of enterprise. India is well positioned to become a global leader in the near future.
301	How can India say that it does not have the potential to lead the world? India is a vast country with tremendous potential that can be tapped into. Believing in oneself and hard work are key factors in making India a potential leader of the world. Other countries can also become potential leaders in their own rights.
302	India has the potential to become a leading nation in the world, as India offers a range of resources, such as a large population, natural resources and a strong economic base. With a surge in innovation and hard work, India can indeed rise up and become a global leader.
303	How can India claim that it does not have the potential to lead the world? India is a uniquely powerful nation that can reach excellence with the right mix of resources and effort. With the right strategies and initiatives in place, India has the potential to lead the world.
304	How can India say that it does not have the potential to lead the world? India is a uniquely privileged country with great potential to become a leader in the world. Believing in oneself and hard work are key factors in achieving success. India has the potential to reach the top alongside any other country in the world.
305	I believe that corporal punishment may provide short-term control, but it does not address the underlying issue and can quickly be forgotten. Additionally, a child can easily overcome a spanking and resume their original behaviour. Therefore, I believe it is better to be slightly strict in order to prevent such behaviour.
306	I believe that it is better to be slightly strict than to abuse a child, as punishments such as spankings do not typically solve the problem and can be easily ignored.
307	I believe that spanking is not an effective long-term solution to the problem and that any parent can simply punish a child by administering a spanking and then allowing them to repeat the behavior. Thus, it is better to be more strict and try to prevent the behavior from occurring in the first place.
308	I believe that spanking is not the most effective way to deal with the issue, as the child may be able to forget the punishment quickly. Instead, I believe it is better to be slightly strict and try to teach the child through guidance and example.
309	I believe that it is better to be slightly strict than to spank a child, as they can usually recover from a spanking quickly and the issue may simply be pushed aside without really solving the problem.
310	It depends on the severity of the crime. If it was a non-violent offense, I would be sympathetic and want my husband to be free, but if it was something more serious such as murder or robbery, I would leave the relationship and not want anything to do with it.
311	It would depend on the severity of the crime. Of course, I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him to be free, but if I knew it was a malicious act, instead of self-defense or defending his family or property, I would likely leave and want nothing to do with it.
312	It depends on the severity of the crime. Of course, I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him to be free, but if I knew it was a malicious act instead of self-defense or defending his family or possessions, I would probably leave and want nothing to do with it.
313	It depends on the severity of the crime. I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him to be free, but if I knew it was a malicious act rather than self-defence or to defend his family or possessions, I would probably leave and want nothing to do with it.
314	It depends on the severity of the crime. I would be sympathetic towards my husband and want him to be free, but if I knew it was a premeditated crime rather than self-defence, or to protect his family or possessions, I might leave and have no inclination to stay.
315	I would be inclined to turn them in. It is not right to take a life, even in self-defense, and I would not want to live next to a murderer.
316	I would turn them in, as I do not believe that is the right thing to do – killing someone and getting away with it is too great a crime to merely avoid punishment. Furthermore, I would not want to be cellmates with a murderer.
317	I would not turn them in as I believe that is not the right thing to do; killing someone and getting away with it is more severe and I also would not want to be cellmates with a murderer.
318	I believe that turning them in is the right thing to do. I do not believe in condoning any crime, particularly murder, and I also prefer to be far from any convicted murderer in a prison setting.
319	I believe that turning them in is the best option as I do not believe in taking the law into one's own hands. Killing someone and getting away with it is a serious crime and I do not want to be in close proximity to a murderer.
320	I would turn them in even if it hurt me. It is important to remove these individuals from the environment since they could pose a danger if allowed to stay free. Furthermore, I may not know for sure that I will not be a victim in the future if I choose not to report it.
321	I would turn them in even if it hurt me. It is dangerous to have murderers out in the environment, as they could commit the crime again. Also, I could not be sure that later on in life I would not be a victim.
322	I would turn them in even if it hurt me. Any murderer who gets away with it once could potentially commit more crimes, making it more dangerous for society if they are released. Additionally, I could not know for sure that I would not be a victim of future crimes if I did not turn them in.
323	I would turn them in even if it hurt me. Any person who commits a murder can potentially commit another crime, so it is dangerous to allow them to remain in the environment. Additionally, I could not know that later in life I might be a victim.
324	I would turn them in even if it hurt me. Any murderer should be held accountable for their crime, as they could commit it again and poses a danger in the environment. Additionally, I could not know for sure that I would not be a victim later in life.
325	The government DOES have the right to regulate what a woman can do with her body, in some cases.  For example, certain activities such as prostitution are restricted in many states, as well as the use of illegal drugs, murder, and theft. Additionally, the government also regulates public nudity, which applies to both men and women. This shows that the government does have the right to make these decisions in some instances.
326	The government does have the right to set laws and regulations to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its citizens, including rules that limit what people can do with their bodies. Restrictions on body freedom can be necessary in some cases to protect people from harm and potential harm. For example, many states have laws prohibiting prostitution and prohibiting the use of certain drugs.
327	The government has the right to place limits on what an individual can do with their body, in some cases, for the sake of public health and safety. For example, in some states, a woman cannot legally prostitute herself, nor can she take illicit drugs into her own body, nor can she use her body to murder others or steal. Similarly, men cannot do these things. The government also has the right to regulate certain activities, such as the use of bodies to display naked images in public.
328	The government does have the right to regulate what a woman can and cannot do with her body in some instances, such as in cases where certain activities present a danger to the woman or other people. It is true that there are limits to what a woman can do with her body, just as there are limits to what men can do with their bodies.
329	The government does have the right to regulate some medical procedures that could pose risks to a woman’s health, such as abortion, as it does with other medical procedures that could pose risks to a woman’s health. It also has the right to regulate some activities that have a significant risk of harm to others, such as certain types of prostitution, which can pose an increased risk of spreading disease or being a victim of trafficking. The government also has the right to restrict access to certain substances, such as illicit drugs, which can have serious health consequences. In addition, the government may also impose certain restrictions on activities that involve physical harm to others, such as murder or theft. These restrictions are in place to ensure the safety of women and others in the society.
330	I am Pro-Life. The fetus is alive and developing in the womb during the early stages of pregnancy, and the mother's hormones and nutrients provide essential nutrition and oxygen to the baby. At this stage, the baby's heart and brain are beginning to form, so it is clear that life is present and the baby is developing. As the pregnancy progresses, the baby's organs will continue to form and mature.
331	I am Pro-Life. While it is true that the fetus is dependent on the mother for nutrients and oxygen until it is able to survive outside the womb, it is still alive and is given legal protection under the law. As for determining when life begins, this is a matter of opinion and varies between different cultures and religions.
332	I am pro-life, as I believe that life begins at conception and abortion should be avoided whenever possible. However, I recognize that abortion is a difficult decision for many women and couples, and that each situation must be weighed carefully.
333	I am pro-life, as I believe that life begins at conception and abortion is the ending of a life. I understand that there are pros and cons to both sides of the abortion debate, but ultimately it is a decision that should be left to the woman and her family to make.
334	I am pro-life. I believe that life begins at conception and that every human being has the right to life and a right to bodily autonomy. Furthermore, as science has made clear, a fetus is alive and develops from a single cell, which can divide and form tissues and organs. Thus, I believe that life is present and begins at conception.
335	In Nebraska, abortion is legal up to the point of viability, which is when the baby is able to survive outside the womb. This means that abortion is not performed until the baby is nearly fully born, giving the mother the right to choose to end the pregnancy if she so wishes. While this may be distressing for some, it is legal and an acceptable option in Nebraska.
336	In Nebraska, abortion is legal up to the point of viability, which is typically around 20 weeks, provided that two physicians confirm that the abortion is necessary to preserve the woman's health. This is in line with the standards set by the National Abortion Federation.
337	In some states in the US, including Nebraska, abortion is legal up to the point of birth, though some restrictions may apply. This means that abortion can be performed if necessary to protect the woman's health or if the baby is not expected to survive outside the womb. This is allowed in order to ensure the woman's health and wellbeing is prioritised.
338	In Nebraska, abortion is allowed up to the point of viability, which is typically around 20 to 22 weeks, depending on the woman's health and the fetus's development. This means that abortion is not performed until the fetus is well outside the womb, giving the woman and her doctor time to consider their options and ensure the fetus has a chance at a healthy life. While this may be different from other states, Nebraska's law is designed to balance the rights of the woman, the doctor, and the fetus.
339	In Nebraska, abortion is allowed up until birth if the mother's health is at risk. This can be a difficult decision for a woman and her family to make, but the law allows for it to be performed if necessary.
340	There should be no argument in this regard; while a fetus is indeed a living organism, the decision of what to do with it should be left to the mother and any other caregivers involved. Every woman has the right to make this decision for herself, and it is important to consider the potential consequences of any decision made.
341	There should be no argument about this; while a fetus is a living organism, it is still part of the mother's body and the development of a pregnancy is a complex and intricate process that is influenced by many factors. It is important to remember that contraception and precautions should always be taken to avoid unintended pregnancy. In the end, it is the mother's decision whether or not to keep the pregnancy.
342	It is understandable that some women may not want to continue a pregnancy in certain situations, but it is important to remember that the fetus is a living organism and an intimate part of the reproductive process. Therefore, it is important that pregnancies not be altered in any way, especially as abortion is an option.
343	There should be no argument about this; a fetus is still a living organism that has been created in an intimate manner, and it is not the child’s choice if it is conceived. Ultimately, it is the decision of the parents as to whether or not to keep the child, and the parents should have the right to raise the child if they so choose.
344	Whether a woman chooses to continue a pregnancy or terminate it is a highly personal decision that should be made based on her own values, beliefs, and circumstances. If she does choose to keep the baby, she has the right to raise it and give it the best life she can provide. It is important to consider the impact of one's decisions on the child, as well as the resources available to provide for the child. Ultimately, it is the mother's choice.
345	There are numerous ways to prevent pregnancy. Condoms are highly effective for both men and women, as well as the morning-after pill, the patch, and other forms of contraception. It is generally the woman’s responsibility to take these measures, although certain exceptions can be made to ensure fairness.
346	There are several methods available to prevent pregnancy, such as condoms for men and women, morning-after pills, the patch, and other forms of contraception. It is generally the woman’s responsibility to ensure that pregnancy is prevented, however, exceptions can be made in certain cases, such as rape.
347	There are many ways to prevent pregnancy. Condoms are highly effective for men and women, as well as the morning-after pill, patch, and other methods. It is the woman’s choice, but with options for safe abortion that allows for more control.
348	There are several methods of birth control available to prevent pregnancy, such as condoms (99% effective) for men and women, emergency contraception (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of birth control. It is primarily the woman’s responsibility to take measures to prevent pregnancy, as most forms of birth control are used by both partners, and abortion laws vary depending on the country.
349	There are many ways to prevent pregnancy. Condoms are effective for both men and women, as are the morning-after pill, the patch, and other methods. It is true that pregnancy can occur even when contraception is used, but this is also true of many forms of contraception. In regards to abortion, some countries allow it in certain cases, such as rape, in order to provide greater choice to women.
350	In some cases, especially when the woman is a victim of rape, allowing the baby to be born could be traumatic for her, as she would have to go through the process of giving the baby up for adoption. While this is an option, it is understandably an emotional decision to make. It is difficult to make a decision on whether or not to keep the baby when the situation arises.
351	If a woman is raped, it can be incredibly traumatic and have long-lasting effects. Though adoption may be an option for the woman, it is difficult to erase the emotional consequences of the crime. While death penalty is a harsh punishment, it could be seen as a way to protect society from future crime of the perpetrator.
352	If a woman is raped, it is understandably a difficult experience that can have long-lasting effects. However, forcing the mother to bear the child of the rapist is not the right course of action, as the child could suffer significant emotional trauma from such an event. Adoption is an option, but killing the baby is not the answer.
353	It is important to consider the impact of a woman's rape on her and the child she may bear as a result. While the woman may choose to give birth and raise the child herself, there is the option of giving the child up for adoption if she does not wish to keep it. This can be an emotionally challenging situation for her, regardless of whether or not she keeps the child. Additionally, while capital punishment is an option, it does not take into account the baby's needs and the potential trauma it could face.
354	If a woman is raped, she may choose to keep the baby, depending on her situation and views on abortion. While it is understandable to want to prevent the death of an infant, keep in mind that the death penalty is a severe punishment that could have an impact on the family even if the infant is adopted. In some cases, the woman may still choose to keep the baby.
355	I believe gay marriage should be allowed, as two people of the same sex being able to legally marry could provide them with many legal and financial benefits. This right should not be denied to couples simply because some people do not agree with same-sex relationships.
356	I believe that gay marriage should be allowed, as couples have the right to decide how they want to live their lives and love each other. Some people may not agree with same-sex relationships, but this should not prevent couples from being allowed to get married.
357	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be legalized. While some people may not agree with gay relationships in particular, the choice to marry should be legally allowed if two people love each other and want to stay together forever.
358	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be legal. Some people who oppose it do not agree with homosexuality in general, which can lead to prejudice. If two people of the same gender love each other and want to be together forever, why should they not be allowed to get married?
359	I believe that same-sex marriage should be allowed, as couples have the right to choose their own partners and have the freedom to marry if they desire it. Some people may not agree with same-sex marriage, but this should not be a reason to prohibit it, as couples should have the option to marry if they want to.
360	Marriage is a social institution that has existed in many societies, including those that were not influenced by Christianity or Judaism. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, which is difficult to prove.
361	Marriage is a concept that exists in many cultures and societies, including those which were unaffected by either Christianity or Judaism. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, although this is difficult to prove.
362	While the Bible does provide the foundation for Christian marriage, this practice is much older than Christianity, having existed in many societies independent of both Christianity and Judaism. Therefore, the Bible cannot be argued to be the sole origin of marriage.
363	Marriage has been a part of many societies throughout history, including those that were not influenced by Christianity or Judaism. This suggests that marriage predates both of these religions, suggesting that the Bible is not the origin of marriage.
364	Marriage predates many of the societies in which Christianity and Judaism were practiced and is therefore a practice that has existed in many cultures independently of these religious beliefs. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, but this is difficult to prove.
365	While it is true that people have the right to make their own decisions regarding their lifestyle, it is important to remember that one should not judge another person's lifestyle simply because it differs from one's own beliefs. We can never know for certain if homosexuality was a choice or not, and it is therefore unwise to make such assumptions.
366	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it. It is true that people have different preferences and lifestyles, and it is important to respect this. However, it is also important to keep in mind that homosexuality is an example of a lifestyle choice that could have been influenced by outside factors, such as family and social environment.
367	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it. While it is true that people have the right to live as they choose, it is important to keep in mind that homosexuality is an aspect of life that may not always be a conscious choice. Every person has the right to determine their own lifestyle.
368	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it. While it is true that people have the right to make their own choices, it is not possible to definitively say that someone's lifestyle was a choice, especially when it comes to sexual orientation, which is a highly personal matter.
369	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it. Everyone has the right to live their life as they please, and it is not up to outside parties to judge the lifestyle of another person.
370	If you do not agree with same-sex marriage, that is your prerogative; however, you should not attempt to impose your views on others. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but it is important to respect the right of others to have different beliefs.
371	If you have a personal opposition to gay marriage, that is your right; however, it is important to remember that everybody is entitled to their own opinion. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that these opinions should not be forced on others, as people have the right to their own beliefs.
372	If you do not agree with gay marriage, that is your personal opinion. However, you may not be comfortable with gay couples showing physical affection, which is your right. However, you should be open to respecting other people's opinions and lives, even if they differ from your own.
373	Everyone is entitled to their own opinions on gay marriage, but it is important to remember that your opinion may not necessarily be the right one. Just as you would not want your views on marriage to be changed, you should also respect the right of others to have different beliefs.
374	Marriage is a personal decision, and individuals have the right to choose what is right for them. While some people may feel strongly that gay marriage is wrong, others may disagree. It is important to respect each other's opinions and recognize that everyone has the right to their own feelings on the matter.
375	I believe that personal growth is more important as it enables you to help yourself first, which enables you to help others. When you reach a point where you are able to assist others, you are able to make an impact on their own development. Therefore, both yourself and others can benefit.
376	I believe that personal growth is more important, as in order to help others, you must first help yourself. At first, this may seem selfish, but once you have achieved a certain level of competency, you can then assist others in doing the same. This allows you to not only help yourself, but also others.
377	I believe that personal growth is more important as it enables you to help yourself first. Once you reach a point where you are skilled in a particular area, you can then help others to do the same. This helps not only yourself, but also others.
378	I believe that personal growth is more important, as helping oneself first enables you to help others. Once you reach a point where you are skilled, you can then assist others in their pursuits. Therefore, both parties benefit from the learning process.
379	I believe that personal growth is more important because in order to help others, you have to help yourself first. At first, this may seem selfish, but once you reach a point where you are skilled at what you are doing, you can then help others do the same. This not only helps you, but also helps others.
380	Sallu, thanks for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police, I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more practically. Why don’t terrorists blow up every city? That’s because the government is in place to ensure public safety and these laws are developed by the people who live in them. Debates happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don’t have to always be right, but take time to learn.
381	Sallu, thank you for your response. Politics is important for society as it provides the framework and laws that enable people to live in safety and stability. Even if no terrorist attacks occur, citizens must still adhere to safety measures such as being searched at airports or when entering certain areas. As you noted, this is to ensure public safety and it is the people who govern the nation. It is important to learn about politics and understand each other's perspectives in order to reach consensus and maintain harmony. While debates are healthy, it is also important to listen and understand each other's views.
382	Sallu, thanks for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police, I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why don’t terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No, but we do have laws and safety measures in place to protect us. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. It is supposed to be built by the people it governs. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don’t have to always be right but take time to learn.
383	I agree that politics is important for the safety and wellbeing of citizens. Laws and values enshrined by a government are important for providing people with a sense of security, as well as ensuring public safety. It is true that terrorists are not always prevented from committing acts of violence, but it is the job of the government to provide people with a sense of security and ensure public safety. This is mainly done through politics, which is created and controlled by the people it governs.
384	Sallu, thank you for your response. I understand your point that politics can be beneficial for people in terms of providing public safety, although I still think more gun control would be beneficial. I think gun control can help reduce crime and make people feel safer, while also allowing people to carry guns if they choose to. Generally, I believe that more laws and regulations can help keep citizens safe.
385	1. I disagree with some of the policies implemented by the Bush administration, such as the invasion of Iraq and the proposed “faith-based” initiatives, which I believe limit individuals’ freedoms and choices. 2. I believe that the government should generally leave religion, spirituality, and moral choices to individuals, as I think it is important to protect our right to make these choices for ourselves.
386	1. I disagree with some of the policies enacted by the Bush administration, such as the restrictions it has placed on abortion rights and the promotion of certain religious beliefs.  I believe that these policies could greatly affect reproductive rights and religious freedom in the country, which could limit the freedom of individuals to make choices for their own lives.  This could pose a threat to individual freedom and safety.  2. I am also concerned about certain policies that could affect LGBT+ rights, as I believe that these policies could limit the freedoms that the LGBT+ community has in the country.  Again, I believe that this could pose a threat to individual freedom and safety.  3. I also disagree with certain policies enacted by the Bush administration, such as its limits on environmental protection and control.  I believe this could pose a threat to the environment and safety of the population living in the country.  4. Finally, I am worried about certain policies that could affect women’s rights, as I believe that this could limit the freedoms that women have in the country.  Again, I believe that this could pose a threat to individual freedom and safety.
387	1. I dislike some of the policies implemented by the current administration, which I believe could have negative consequences for the country.  2. I believe that the government should remain largely out of our lives, in order to allow for individual autonomy and the right to make choices in our lives.  3. I feel that the administration is trying to impose a particular set of values on the population, which I personally disagree with.  4. In some cases, I believe that the government should be involved in regulating certain aspects of our lives in order to ensure safety; however, I believe that this should be decided on a case-by-case basis.  5. I believe that certain decisions should be made by the government, such as in terms of social policies, in order to ensure social cohesion.  6. I believe that the government should allow for individual freedom in terms of personal choices, while also ensuring a certain level of security.
388	I believe that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; I believe that government should be concerned with protecting our individual safety, rather than controlling how we live our lives on the spiritual or individual level. Thus, I do not agree with the actions of the government Bush is attempting to put in place.
389	I disagree with some of the policies implemented by the current administration, such as its definition of abortion and limitations on stem cell research. I believe that such decisions should be made by the individuals in consultation with their physicians, as the government has no right to control how we lead our lives. Therefore, I feel that the current administration is intruding into personal freedoms that should be protected.
390	Its been practiced by many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia, which existed before the Egyptian civilization. While it was developed in certain parts of Europe, it was not limited to those regions and was also spread across Africa and Americas. In terms of health, Africa has been impacted by similar issues such as drought and disease, as well as civil wars and ethnic genocide, similar to what happened in many parts of Africa and America alike.
391	It has been practiced by many ancient civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. While some modern countries in Africa have faced challenges, America has provided many opportunities for its citizens.
392	Its been a part of human culture for centuries, with some of the earliest civilizations practicing it in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. It was not created by a single entity, but evolved over time. Africa has faced its share of challenges due to factors such as climate change, disease, and civil war, which can impact economic development. America has had a more stable history, offering many opportunities for its inhabitants.
393	Archaeological evidence suggests that certain forms of slavery were practiced in Mesopotamia as early as 3500 BC, indicating that it was already established among some of the earliest civilizations. While the exact origins of slavery are difficult to pinpoint, it is clear that it has existed for thousands of years.
394	Its been practiced by many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia, which is older than Egypt. It was developed independently by different cultures around the world, including in America. While Africa does have some issues, America has a stable economy and better living conditions.
395	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take action and fight for it. California is generally good about giving children access to both parents, although there may be some exceptions. You need to either establish a court order or go through the legal process in the state where the most recent court order was issued. It is important to keep contact with your children as they could be negatively affected if you are not present in their lives.
396	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take steps to fight for it. California is generally fair when it comes to dads; children have legal rights to have contact with you, although it can have an impact on them if you are not present. If you do not have a court order, then you will need to find an attorney who can provide assistance in the jurisdiction of the most recent court order.  Although this may be difficult for the children, it is important to ensure that contact is maintained.
397	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take action and fight for it. California is generally quite fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you; however, this can be subject to variation depending on the circumstances of your case. You may need to enlist the help of an attorney in order to ensure your rights are properly established.
398	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take action and fight for it. California is generally generous when it comes to dads; children have legal rights to have contact with you, unless there is a court reason. You need to find an attorney in the jurisdiction of the latest court order; it is important to make sure the contact order is in place. Make sure to fight for this contact; it is important for your children to have stability and to feel connected to you.
399	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to take action to fight for it. California is generally fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you. In order to ensure that contact is maintained, it is important to obtain a court order that outlines the parameters of the contact. If you do not already have a court order, you should speak to an attorney in the jurisdiction where the most recent court order is issued.
400	I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one if necessary. According to the legal text, the right to exchange the Work for other copyrighted works through digital file-sharing is allowed, as long as there is no payment of monetary compensation. The intention of the exchange is considered, and the license allows some exchange activities, though making money is generally discouraged.
401	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text states that any exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works is allowed as long as it is not primarily intended for commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This means that you are allowed to exchange the Work for other copyrighted works, as long as this is not your primary intention. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so is.
402	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works."  It is important to note that the license prohibits activities that are primarily intended for commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, which can be subjective and depend on the circumstances. As long as the primary purpose is not primarily intended for monetary gain, you may be within the license.
403	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably consult one for further advice. According to the license, the primary intention of the action cannot be primarily intended for commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. However, the exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works via digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered as intending to generate commercial benefit or compensation. The license allows for making money from the site as long as the costs of running the site are taken into consideration, including non-monetary costs like your time.
404	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works."    Determining what is “primarily intended” for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
405	No.  That is the beauty of the US healthcare system; everyone is required to pay taxes to fund it, regardless of need. Going to jail can have long-term consequences for an individual; the lack of access to healthcare is one of these consequences. While healthcare is a right, there are costs associated with it and these costs must be covered by taxes. This ensures that everyone has access to the care they need.
406	No.  The United States has a system of universal health care, known as Medicare, which all citizens and permanent residents are eligible for, regardless of their age or previous health conditions. This is funded by taxes, which everyone has to pay.  If he had contributed to society, he would have access to these services. Jail does not provide any benefits in terms of health care.
407	No.  That is the beauty of the United States; everyone has access to healthcare, regardless of whether an individual has to go to jail or not. Taxes are used to pay for this system, ensuring that everyone has access to these benefits. Jail does not come with any specific benefits, aside from the right to receive medical care.
408	No.  The US health care system is partially funded by taxes, so the cost of medical care is shared among the general public. It is understandable that jail comes with certain costs, but these may not be fully covered by taxation.  Moreover, the fact that he committed crimes may have led to his situation.  Social services and access to health care could have helped him stay in the community rather than go to jail.
409	No, that is the nature of the US healthcare system. While other individuals pay taxes, your brother is in jail for his crimes; jail does not provide any compensatory benefits. It is possible that your brother's situation may have been different had he contributed to society rather than commit crimes.
410	Yes, execution provides a measure of justice for the victims and their families. It can help them move on, particularly if the victim never has another birthday or celebrates another holiday with their family. Capital punishment is an option in certain cases, as it offers some form of closure.
411	Executing a murderer can help provide closure to the victim's family and bring justice to the situation, as the victim and their family may never have another birthday or holiday together. This provides a sense of justice that can be beneficial for the families.
412	Execution can provide some closure to the families of murder victims, as it removes the possibility of the criminal committing further crimes and ensures that their victims' families can move on. Execution can be a more effective punishment than imprisonment in certain cases.
413	Yes. Executing a murderer can help provide some closure for the victim's family and ensure that the perpetrator cannot harm anyone else. This can help to ease the pain of the tragedy and provide a sense of justice.
414	Yes. Executing a murderer helps alleviate the pain of the victim's family and provides some sense of justice. It is difficult to quantify the emotional toll that keeping a murderer in prison can have on the families of the victims, who may never fully recover from their loss. Execution provides some form of closure that death cannot erase the victims' memories and experiences.
415	In some locations, it is illegal to skate due to safety concerns; this is to prevent skaters from endangering pedestrians, as skating can be hazardous when done in public areas where people are walking.
416	Skating in general is not illegal; it is only prohibited in certain public places in order to prevent accidents. I worked at a store where skaters on the sidewalknear the storenear the store caused concern for our elderly customers, resulting in the regulation of skating in certain areas.
417	In some locations, skating is not allowed due to safety concerns. This is because skating in certain areas can be dangerous, as it may result in injuries to people simply walking by.
418	Skating in certain public spaces is prohibited in order to ensure the safety of people in those areas. This is due to the potential danger it poses, as skating in certain locations could lead to individuals being injured.
419	Skating is generally not illegal, but in some public places it is restricted due to safety concerns. I used to work at a store, and we would often have skaters on our sidewalk, which could have posed an hazard to passing pedestrians.
420	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought?  How long will it take for legislation to have an effect?  Even if laws are passed, it may take time for attitudes to change.  Legislation can help create an environment where people are more accepting of one another and provide more protection for marginalized groups.  This can help create a more equitable society, but it may take time.  It is important to create laws to protect these rights and ensure people’s safety.
421	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought?  How long will it take for those beliefs to become accepted by society?   Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?  Society's views on certain topics can change over time, so it's difficult to predict how society willreact in the future.  Even if the government chooses to intervene, it is difficult to predict the consequences this could have on individuals.  Ultimately, the government could choose to criminalize certain beliefs if it deems it necessary.
422	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought?  How long will it take for laws to be put in place to protect certain beliefs?  Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?    The government has the responsibility to protect its citizens from discrimination and violence, regardless of the beliefs in question. It is important to have laws in place to ensure people's safety, and to protect their right to freedom of belief.  Although laws can provide some protection, it may be difficult to prevent attacks in all cases.  People should be aware that they could face violent opposition for their beliefs.
423	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought?  How long will it take for laws to be enacted to protect certain beliefs?  Are you prepared to face criminal charges for your beliefs?   Governments have the power to restrict freedoms, and laws can be enacted to protect certain beliefs if the government chooses to do so. This could potentially limit an individual's freedom of expression.  It is important for government to consider the potential effects this could have on individuals' beliefs.
424	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought?  How long will it take for legislation to make such beliefs legally acceptable?  Are you prepared to accept this change in the law?   The government plays an important role in protecting civil rights, including the right to express controversial beliefs.  It will take time for the law to catch up to this evolution in public opinion, but this process should be managed carefully to ensure that people’s rights are respected.
425	If you were the dad: You can always request a review of the child support amount, which takes some time to complete.  Courts usually look at the father's income and then calculate a percentage of his income, based on the State's guidelines.  This percentage may change periodically, depending on the State's laws.   Otherwise, some states provide cost of living increases every year.  However, this evaluation is only done every few years.    It is better to request a review, because circumstances can change over time.
426	If you were the dad:  You can always request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.  Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage; now he's got a decent job. This is evaluated by a percentage of his income.    Otherwise, you can ask for a review of the support amount.
427	If you were the dad: You can always request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income. Then they reevaluate the amount per month owed. States give cost of living increases every year.  In some cases, these adjustments are made to ensure that the amount owed more accurately reflects the parent's current financial situation.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete.  Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage; now he's got a decent job.  It goes by a percentage of his income.  States give cost of living increases every year.
428	If you were the dad:  You can always request a review of the child support order if you believe that the amount of child support is no longer accurate due to a change in the income of either parent or other circumstances. The court will then evaluate the amount and make adjustments as needed.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.
429	Child support is usually determined by the court, based on the income of both parents. If the parents have different levels of income, the court will assess how much each parent should contribute and calculate the child support based on a percentage of the non-custodial parent's income. States usually give cost of living increases every year, although some do not.
430	Unfortunately, I agree that it can be difficult to commit wholeheartedly to these missions. While it is important to take a stand and ensure the safety of our troops, it is often difficult to get fully involved in international politics and we end up paying the price with casualties. Executive Outcomes provides an example of how these missions can be carried out effectively.
431	Unfortunately, I agree that it can be difficult to commit to these operations, as the political issues often make it difficult for us to do so. While we may be willing to send troops in some cases, we tend to lack the necessary commitment to make these missions successful, which often leads to casualties and a lack of public support.
432	Unless there is something in it for us to truly commit to a mission, our reluctance to do so often leaves us short on results and cost in terms of casualties, meaning it is difficult to accept. Looking at the example of Executive Outcomes can provide a good model for success.
433	Although international police actions can be difficult and costly, it is important to consider the consequences of not being engaged in order to make sure we do not fall short. For example, South Africa's Executive Outcomes provided training and logistical support to the Angolan government in the 1990s to help stabilize the area and end the civil war. This effort helped to reduce the death toll, which could have been much worse if not acted upon.
434	Unless there is something in it for us, it can be difficult to commit troops to a mission, which often means we only partially engage. This can lead to casualties and public criticism. This has been the case in the past, so we need to be sure the commitment is fully supported.
435	Yes, if you are connected to the city sewers, you will have to pay for it. Your city councilman may have negotiated a payment delay when the sewers were first installed, but you will still have to pay for the service. They charged me an additional sewer fee when I filled my pool, even though it didn't go down the drain.
436	Yes, if you are connected to the city sewers, you may have to pay for the service, depending on the city's regulations. Your city may have negotiated a payment delay when the sewers were first installed. Even if it is the city's fault, you will still have to pay for it. They can charge you if it is feasible.
437	No, if you are connected to city sewers, you will have to pay. Check with your city councilman to find out if there is a billing delay in place, as it may have been negotiated. Even if it is a city's oversight, they will charge you for it. This is especially true if your neighbors are connected, as there is no choice in the matter.
438	Yes, if you are connected to city sewers, you will have to pay for it. The city council may have negotiated a billing delay when the system was first installed, but there is a chance they will charge you for it if it is a service you have to pay for. They will generally charge you if they can. Since all your neighbors are connected, there are likely no choices given.
439	No, if you are connected to city sewers, you must pay. Check with your city councilman to find out if there is a delay in billing. They may charge you extra if it is a large amount, such as when filling a pool. This is legal, as the city has the right to charge you if it is part of a sewer system. Your neighbors' connections may make it more costly to operate.
440	In Illinois, there are no specific laws regarding minimum ages for babysitting or leaving children alone; however, it is important to keep in mind the general child endangerment laws which dictate that minors under the age of 18 should not be left unattended by an adult. Additionally, the age of the minor and the environment should be taken into consideration when determining the suitability of the situation.
441	It depends on the state, as some states have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone. However, Illinois law does not specify any specific ages.
442	Although there is no specific law in Illinois addressing minimum ages for babysitting or leaving children home alone, it is best to ensure the safety of the children and the home environment by keeping younger children supervised. 15-16 years old are generally seen as appropriate minimum ages for these situations.
443	In Illinois, there is no law establishing a specific minimum age to babysit or the number of hours of supervision required for children under a certain age. This means that, depending on the state, parents are responsible for determining what age their children can be left alone based on their own assessment.
444	Some states may have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone; however, Illinois law in this regard is not clear and may depend on the situation. Generally, it is wise to consult with parents before leaving children unsupervised if they are under the age of 15 or 16.
445	In a free society, individuals have the right to be shielded from content they find offensive. However, in most countries, individuals are able to access content that offends them, such as newspapers, television, and the internet. The right to protest and rally in support of one’s beliefs is a powerful tool to make one’s voice heard. Ultimately, one’s faith is a matter of personal conviction, and individuals should be able to hold strongly to their beliefs even if they differ from the majority culture.
446	In a free society, individuals are entitled to be protected from viewing materials that may be offensive to them. Depending on the country, individuals have the right to protest peacefully, picket and rally to express their concerns. As mentioned, one’s faith or beliefs are key in determining how an individual feels about content. However, governments are able to provide some form of protection from content that is deemed objectionable.  As such, governments can enact laws to protect citizens from being subjected to offensive content.
447	In a free society, individuals have the right to be protected from offensive materials, especially if their faith is strong. Protests and petitions can be used to express concerns, and governments should respect these rights. However, it is important to note that individuals may be offended by material in the West, and this cannot be denied.
448	In a free society, individuals have the right to be shielded from offensive materials, provided they are able to peacefully express their concerns. However, governments are responsible for upholding citizens’ right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to be exposed to offensive materials. Therefore, it is ultimately up to the government to determine what is legal and acceptable in a society.
449	In a free society, citizens have the right to be shielded from content that they find offensive. While this right is not absolute, it is important that citizens are able to maintain their sense of safety and privacy. If citizens feel strongly enough, they have the right to protest, picket, or rally in order to pressure the government to take action.  The government should also ensure that the religion of its citizens is respected and protected.
450	I feel that it goes against what America stands for. While the government claims that it is for public safety, I still don't feel safe with someone listening to my phone calls. It seems like an invasion of my personal privacy.
451	I think it goes against what America stands for to have the government monitor our phone calls and location data. While the government claims it is for public safety, I do not feel safe with that knowledge. Cell phones have become a crucial part of modern life, and I believe that our rights to privacy should be respected.
452	I think it goes against our privacy and our freedom as Americans to have the government monitoring our phones in such a way. While the government claims it is for public safety, I do not feel safe with this knowledge.
453	I feel that having such strong surveillance measures could potentially infringe on personal freedom and erode our sense of security. While I understand the government’s desire to keep us safe, I am uncomfortable with the idea of someone listening to my phone calls.
454	I feel that it goes against the core values of our nation, as Americans we have a right to privacy and the government should not be tracking our movements and activities without our consent. While I understand the government's desire to protect us, I still feel uneasy about it.
455	I believe that the opinion of a country or region by other countries and people varies based on the culture and history of each country. Some regions might be more popular than others and some countries may be disliked due to certain issues such as violence or corruption.
456	I would say not all countries are viewed favorably by other countries; this depends on the country's culture and history, as well as the relationship between the countries. Additionally, some countries may not have favorable views of each other due to past events or the government's actions.
457	I would argue that not all countries are viewed equally by the global community. Some countries have a higher reputation than others due to their economic and political stability, educational systems, infrastructure, and other factors. For example, some countries may have higher standards of living than others, or be more peaceful or stable than others. Countries form bonds with each other based on these factors, which affect how the global community views them.
458	I would say not all foreign countries are equally popular among countries, depending on the country and its culture. Countries may have certain attractions that make them more popular among tourists than others.
459	I would say not all countries are viewed positively by other countries; it depends on the country and its history with the others. Similarly, some countries are not popular choices for tourists due to their culture or government.
460	OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license?  We need the law to enhance security against terrorists.  Many of the 9/11 terrorists had drivers licenses, which they would have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements of the bill.  The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal level of English language proficiency, and proof of address.  The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security.  The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, thus not placing an additional burden on the states.
461	Creating a national drivers license could be beneficial to security and help to keep terrorists from obtaining drivers licenses. To do this, the government could set up stricter requirements, such as proof of citizenship, knowledge of the English language and proof of address. The Department of Homeland Security would have oversight of the program, which would be funded by the fees paid by the drivers. This would remove a burden from the states.
462	OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license? This would improve security and provide more consistent requirements nationwide. The new law would require proof of citizenship, some knowledge of the English language, and proof of address. The licenses would be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security, and the funding would come from the fees paid by the drivers, so it would not need additional tax revenues. This would be beneficial to the states.
463	Creating a national drivers license is a good idea as it will increase security against terrorists. To do this, the legislation should require proof of citizenship, at least a minimum level of English language proficiency, and proof of address. The Department of Homeland Security should be in charge of granting and regulating the licenses, with the fees paid by the drivers offsetting any costs. This is more efficient than a state-run system and reduces the burden on states.
464	OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license? This would make the country more secure against terrorists, as the new licenses would require proof of citizenship, at least a minimal level of English proficiency, and proof of address. Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security would be responsible for granting and regulating the licenses, which would be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, thus not requiring additional tax revenues. Additionally, this would streamline the process, as it moves the responsibility from the states to the federal government.
465	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?  Yes, Che's words are still relevant today. He believed that the idea of freedom from oppression is capable of spreading, regardless of attempts to stamp it out. Even though oppression still exists in the world, there is a desire for freedom from it. There are similar conditions in place compared to when Che was alive.
466	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?  Yes, Che's words are still relevant today. He argued that the idea of freedom from oppression is catching and will spread despite efforts to quash it. This is still the case in many parts of the world.
467	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?   Yes, Che's ideas of freedom have spread throughout the world, as people continue to fight for freedom from oppression. Even though governments have worked to suppress these ideas, they have not been able to completely stamp them out. Therefore, his ideas continue to spread.
468	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?  Yes, Che Guevara's quote suggests that ideas of freedom can spread even if governments attempt to stamp it out. This is because these ideas of freedom have the potential to spread to new contexts and situations, just as it did in Che's time.
469	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?   Yes, Che's ideas about the spread of freedom have certainly proven correct. As he stated, ideas regarding freedom from oppression are still spreading and have led to many people gaining more rights and more freedom. This suggests that such ideals can indeed become widespread over time.
470	In one sense, it is possible to argue that laws reflect morality, as laws are created to reflect the moral values of a society. However, it is also true that morality can stem from laws, as laws are made to ensure that everyone follows a certain code of conduct. This is particularly the case in a democracy, where the majority rules and its values are respected.
471	In one sense, it is true that laws can serve as a reflection of morality, as laws are created to uphold and provide structure to society's moral values. On the other hand, morality can also stem from laws, as laws are created in response to the changing moral values of a society. This is especially true in a democracy such as ours, where the majority rules and laws are formulated to reflect the values of the current majority.
472	In one sense, you bring up an interesting point. Laws do play an important role in reflecting a society's morality, as Durant points out. In the case of our modern societies, lawmakers have come together to create laws that reflect the collective values of the citizens. These laws then serve as a set of rules that citizens must adhere to. At the same time, it is also true that morality can stem from laws made by a society, as Durant suggests. It is an interesting idea to consider.
473	In one sense, yes, laws can reflect morality and vice-versa. While our laws are created to protect and preserve certain moral values, these values can also be a source of laws, as you point out. In other words, morality can stem from laws, and laws can reflect morality. It is important to note that this is not the only case, as laws can also be shaped by the majority's values. In this way, our morality is able to influence and be influenced by our laws.
474	In one sense, the development of laws can be seen as a reflection of the morality of a society. As societies develop, the rules and regulations put in place by the law reflect the collective morality of the people. However, I believe that morality can stem from laws, as laws can shape the morality of a society.
475	The court can invalidate a conviction, although it may remain on the records for some time.  Access to expungement depends on the laws of the state, but it is difficult to completely remove records of an arrest from the files.  Even if expungement is granted, the fact of the arrest will always remain as part of the record.
476	The court can invalidate a conviction but it is not a simple process; expungement of records can be granted, but it may still be possible to access records. It is difficult to completely erase records as the arrest itself will remain on the trail.
477	The appeals process should be won.  Courts can vacate a conviction, though it may require additional legal work.  Even if expungement is granted, there is always a record of the arrest that remains; it is difficult to completely remove all traces of it, even with a court order.
478	The appeals process can be difficult and time-consuming, as it requires filing documents and attending court hearings. In some instances, courts may choose to expunge records, although this is not always possible. Even if expungement is granted, records may still remain on file.
479	The court can vacate a conviction, but expungement of the records requires more legal work and may not completely remove the conviction from the records. Even if expungement is granted, there is always a record of the arrest that remains. It is difficult to completely erase all traces of the conviction.
480	If my neighbor smokes pot, it does not necessarily mean that it affects me directly. However, the legal implications of drug use can have an impact on society as a whole. It is ultimately the government’s role to ensure public safety by setting laws and regulations that promote healthy living conditions for its citizens. Ultimately, the choice to consume drugs should be left to the individual and their family.
481	If my neighbor smokes pot, it doesn't infringe on my rights. I may not agree with it, but it is their right to make these choices with their body. Government interference in this area has caused more harm than good. The current drug policy should be reexamined to ensure that it is truly effective in reducing the harms of drugs.
482	If my neighbor chooses to smoke pot, it does not necessarily infringe upon my rights. While it is generally up to individuals to make decisions about their own health and wellbeing, it is not the role of government to dictate what people may or may not do. Drug laws in the US have had many unintended consequences that have done more harm than good.
483	If my neighbor chooses to smoke pot, it does not directly infringe on my rights. However, if marijuana use is legalized on a larger scale, it could lead to increased availability and exposure for minors, which could have an impact on their wellbeing. In addition, marijuana use can affect the user's judgment and ability to drive, which could pose risks to the user and others on the road. It is thus appropriate for the government to regulate the use of drugs to ensure public safety.
484	If my neighbor smokes marijuana, it does not directly impact me or my rights. However, marijuana is still an illegal substance under federal law, meaning that it is the government's responsibility to enforce these laws and ensure public safety. This can lead to undesirable consequences, such as creating barriers to accessing rehab and other resources that could help those who wish to quit using drugs.
485	It is understandable that you want your family to have the same rights as other families in the country. In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and brought up in the country, but unfortunately, this is not the case in many countries, including Britain. This can create a disadvantage if you become unemployed or sick, as you receive fewer benefits than immigrants, who get more of the money you have worked for.
486	In some countries, including the UK, it is true that immigrants can receive more rights and benefits than locals, while this is not the case for us. This can lead to us having fewer rights and less access to benefits when we become unemployed or sick, while immigrants get more of our money that we worked for.
487	It is understandable that you want your family to have the same rights as other families in the country, however, in Britain, this is not the case. While immigrants are given more benefits if they become unemployed or sick, legal immigrants receive less benefits from the government than those who were born and raised in the country. This leads to a lack of equal rights for those born and bred in the country.
488	In some countries, including the UK, people who are born and raised in the country have fewer rights compared to immigrants, who often receive more benefits, such as access to welfare and healthcare. This can be unfair for people who have grown up in the country, while those who are immigrants often get more of the money that we have worked for.
489	Yes, I believe that I and my family should have equal rights and benefits, regardless of whether we were born and raised in the country. Unfortunately, this is not the case in some countries, such as the UK, where we have fewer rights and access to benefits compared to immigrants, even when we have worked for it.
490	Your crime will likely impact your ability to get a job, as most employers will take a record into consideration when deciding whether to hire someone. The fact that the crime committed was yours alone could make an employer hesitant to hire you, as companies have the right to reject applicants for any reason. Depending on the crime, I may choose not to hire someone as well.  Additionally, Michigan’s economy and high unemployment rate make it difficult for job openings to meet the demand.
491	your crime does not fit under discrimination, as it is a choice that you made. That said, these factors are taken into consideration during the hiring process, and companies have the right to deny employment for any reason. However, in Michigan, the economy and unemployment rate are factors that can make job opportunities more limited.
492	Your crime does not necessarily preclude employment; it is ultimately up to the company’s discretion. Every state has its own laws and regulations when it comes to hiring, and companies may decline to hire an individual for any reason. In Michigan, the economy and unemployment rates are so bad that there are not enough job openings. Companies will check an individual's criminal record if they ask.
493	your crime does not fit under discrimination, as it was a choice that you made. That could have different consequences than race, gender, etc. I understand that companies may deny someone an opportunity based on their criminal record if they feel it could pose a risk to their business. However, I believe that every state has its own laws regarding this matter. In Michigan, the economy and unemployment rate are very low, which can make job opportunities harder to come by.
494	Your crime does not fit under discrimination, as these crimes are a choice and may vary in severity; race, gender and other factors are typically considered when hiring, as companies can refuse to hire based on any reason they choose.  While laws may vary by state, I believe that Michigan's unemployment has made it difficult for companies to provide enough job openings in the state.  If a company chooses to, they may deny an individual based on their criminal record.
495	This is an interesting point; however, laws such as "hate crime" laws enhance penalties based on the defendant's beliefs or motivations can increase punishments if the crime is committed with a certain state of mind. This means that an individual may face harsher punishments for their thoughts and beliefs in addition to the crime itself.
496	This is an interesting point to consider, as some laws punish individuals more severely based on their opinion, even when committing the same crime. I am referring to 'Hate Crime' laws, which increase the criminal penalty based on the defendant's reasoning for the crime. For example, if one individual kills another individual because of their hate of that person's ethnicity or religious views, they will receive a harsher punishment than another person who kills without hate, as the law views this as an aggravating factor. This raises the question of whether people should be punished for their thoughts as well as their actions.
497	This is an interesting question, as some laws penalize individuals more severely based on their opinion, even when committing exactly the same crime. I am referring to “Hate Crime” laws, which enhance a criminal offense due to the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. Therefore, if one person kills another person simply because they hate that person's ethnicity or religious beliefs, they will receive a harsher punishment than another person who kills without hate. Thus, while you are entitled to your opinion, you will be punished for your thoughts as well as the act.
498	This is an interesting question, as some laws increase the severity of punishments if the crime is motivated by a person's opinion or beliefs. For example, so-called "Hate Crimes" laws can enhance the punishment for an individual committing a crime based on their views or reasoning. Even if one individual commits murder due to a hate crime, they can receive a harsher punishment than another person who murders without hatred, simply because they enjoy killing. This means that one's thoughts can have an impact on the penalty given, even if it is not the actual act that causes the greater penalty. Thus, one is still punished for their thoughts and beliefs, even if it is in addition to the crime itself.
499	This is an interesting point; Hate Crime laws enhance penalties based on the perpetrator's opinion or rationale for committing the crime, which can result in harsher punishments for the perpetrator. This raises the question of whether the state is able to prosecute an individual more severely based on their opinion, even if the crime is committed under similar circumstances.
500	Answering questions about a judgment can help provide context.  Was the judgment for a civil case, or criminal?  When was it entered?  Does it still show up on your credit report?  What state do you live in?  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.  Although it may remain on your credit report, it will not affect your credit score.
501	Why on Earth do people answer these questions when they have no idea what they're talking about?  Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good.  They are not permitted to give legal advice.    That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgement.  What was it for?  When was it perfected?  Why do you say that it is expired?  What state do you live in?  In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.    The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged.  Chances are real slim on that.  Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
502	Answering questions from customers is an important part of providing good customer service. While it is understandable that some customers may prefer to get more information from a legal expert, it is better to get information from customer service agents, as they are better equipped to provide information related to the product or service being asked about. The customer service agents are often trained to provide general information about the product or service being asked about. In some cases, they may even be able to provide additional details about the product or service, or refer customers to an expert who can answer more detailed questions. While customer service agents cannot provide legal advice, they may be able to provide more information that can be helpful to customers.
503	Why on Earth do people answer these questions when they have no idea what they're talking about?  Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good?  While answers to legal questions vary from state to state, generally courts are permitted to provide guidance on civil judgments, such as the amount owed, interest rate, and the length of the judgment.  Additionally, in some states, civil judgments may remain on a credit report for up to 10 years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.  However, it is possible to petition the court to have it expunged.  Chances are slim, but it is possible.  Ultimately, the only way to have the judgment fully removed from the credit report is to take action and petition the court.
504	Answering court orders can be difficult, as court records are private and not all courts make their documents available online.  Generally, the only way to access court documents is to appear in person or through an attorney.  However, some states now make court documents available online.  Knowing the state in which the judgment was filed may help you find more information.  In California, for instance, judgments expire after 10 years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.  However, you may still want to consider petitioning the court to have it expunged.  Chances are slim, but it is possible.  Additionally, you may want to speak with a credit repair expert who can help you understand your options.
505	I believe you have a case, as you were willing to pay for the repairs to be completed to a reasonable standard. If necessary, Small Claims Court can provide a remedy; you may have to enlist the help of a lawyer to draft the documents, unless the court clerk is willing to assist. You did agree to the repairs, but it is possible to argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality.
506	I think you have a case, depending on the state, you may be able to file a small claims court action to obtain payment. In some states, the court clerk may be able to help you draft the documents, depending on your state’s rules. You did agree to the repairs, but you may argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality.
507	I think you have a case. Depending on the laws of your state, you may be able to file a small claims court case to obtain payment. You could also seek the help of a lawyer to write up the court documents. Payment for these repairs may have been agreed upon, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality.
508	I think you have a case and it may be worth taking it to court if necessary. Generally, the courts can help you to enforce the warranties written into the contract, although this may require you to pay for a lawyer's help in writing up the documents. You may have to pay for court fees if necessary.  If the repairs do not reach the original quality, you can argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality.
509	I believe you have a case. Did you happen to take pictures of the repairs? Sometimes the threat of small claims court can help obtain a payment. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. You agreed to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. Good luck.
510	With other issues of dependability aside, it is important to have some form of protection. Even if the police are not present to protect you, the situation could still turn fatal within minutes. Therefore, it is your right and responsibility to defend yourself and your family.
511	With other issues aside, it is essential to have some form of protection in place. Even if the police are close by, an attack can happen quickly and can be fatal. You have the right and responsibility to defend yourself and your family.
512	With other issues of dependability aside, it is important to have some form of protection, such as a weapon, available in an emergency situation. Even if you do call the police and they are nearby, it is possible to be killed within minutes.      You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family.
513	With other issues of depending on the government aside, you need some form of protection in place. Even if the police are able to respond quickly, they may not be able to prevent the crime from taking place in a matter of minutes. You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family in such situations.
514	With other safety concerns aside, it is important to have protection in place in case of an emergency, as police response times may be too slow in some situations. Even if you are able to call the police and they are nearby, it is still possible to be killed in a short amount of time.    You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family.
515	I think prostitution is largely viewed as exploitative, particularly if a woman chooses to have sex with men in exchange for money. However, if the situation is reversed and a man offers money in exchange for sex, the situation is often viewed as more acceptable. Personally, I believe that if both parties agree to the activity and feel comfortable with it, then it should be legal to decide for oneself if one wants to engage in it or not.
516	I think prostitution is overrated; if people want to have sex and receive payment, it is not necessary. A woman can have sex with many men and receive nothing, which is seen as prostitution. However, if the men offer money, it is accepted, which I believe is a valid solution for both parties. If the woman needs money and the man is willing to pay, then it is a valid option.
517	I think prostitution is overrated; if people want to have sex and get paid, it's up to them. A woman can have sex with multiple men and get nothing, which is considered prostitution, while if a man offers to pay for it, some women may view it as a valid option to get the bill paid and feel good while doing it.
518	I think prostitution is overly stigmatized; if people want to have sex and get paid, that is their choice. A woman can have sex with many men and get nothing, yet if prostitution is legalized, she can receive taxable income from it. My take is if a man is willing to pay for sex, then it can be an efficient way to obtain the funds needed to meet one's needs, such as paying bills.
519	I think prostitution is overrated; if people want to have sex and get paid, there is no need for it. A woman can have sex with multiple men and get nothing, which is viewed as prostitution—why? If a man offers payment, it is seen as a valid option, which can help pay the bill and feel good while doing it.
520	Our borders should be closed in order to protect our nation and its citizens while we are still recovering. Yes, we want to help other countries and provide humanitarian aid, but our nation needs time to heal. We must prioritize the needs of our own nation first. Additionally, learning English should be a priority for those wanting to enter the United States, as it is an important skill to have when looking for jobs and housing.
521	Our borders should be closed, as we are at war, we cannot afford to take care of these people. We need to prioritize the needs of our own country and its citizens first, while also striving to better our own situations. We cannot take in immigrants when our own needs are not being met.  It is understandable that people feel this way, but we must also recognize that immigration can bring many benefits to a country, which is why it needs to be regulated to ensure it does not put too much strain on a country’s resources.
522	Our borders should be open, as we are a nation of immigrants. We should provide these individuals with assistance to integrate into our society and provide them with the resources they need to learn English. We should provide them with access to educational resources and other services to ensure that their transition is as smooth as possible. We must also make sure that we are providing adequate resources to our own communities and preventing further displacement of local populations.
523	Our borders should be closed for now, as we are still recovering from the economic downturn. We need to ensure our own infrastructure is in place before we take additional steps to integrate immigrants into our society. Yes, these immigrants should learn English before coming to the US, but this should be done through language classes and other educational programs, not by requiring it as a condition of staying in the US. Additionally, we should make sure the local communities are equipped with the resources to help immigrants integrate into our society.
524	Our borders should be open, as we are a country in a state of flux and need to be able to accept immigrants who can contribute to the growth of our nation. While learning a new language can be difficult and costly, learning English should be made available as a priority in order to facilitate integration into our society. We need to ensure that immigrants are given the chance to contribute to the betterment of our country, while also recognizing that this process takes time.
525	There are many types of abuse, both physical and mental. It is possible that she no longer wants to be around you, and the restraining order may provide some emotional peace. This enables her to feel more safe and secure.
526	There are many types of abuse, such as mental, physical, and emotional abuse. It is possible that she simply does not want to be around you anymore, or that the order serves as a source of peace of mind. It can provide a safe space for the heart to rest easier.
527	There are many types of abuse, both mental and physical, as well as emotional and verbal abuse. It is difficult to know the reasons why a person may feel safer with some distance from their partner, but a restraining order can provide a sense of security and peace of mind.
528	There are many types of abuse, both physical and mental. It is difficult to know the full context behind the restraining order; however, it can provide a sense of peace and security for the victim, which is a valid reason for obtaining one. It can also reduce the fear and anxiety of being in contact with the abuser.
529	There are many types of abuse, both mental and physical. It is difficult to know the reasons why someone may request a restraining order, as it provides a sense of security for the individual. It can give an individual peace of mind to be away from an abusive situation.
530	Firstly, police officers have a duty to enforce laws that are in place, and this can cause disruption to those breaking the law. While it is understandable to be upset by this, it is a necessary part of maintaining law and order. Secondly, I as a police officer will always balance the needs of the community, the laws and the individuals, to ensure that action is taken in accordance with the law.
531	Firstly, law enforcement officers have a duty to uphold the laws that are in place, regardless of whether an individual agrees with the law or not. If an individual chooses to break the law, law enforcement will enforce it, which can lead to an individual being issued a citation. Secondly, I understand that everyone has the right to feel and react differently to laws and rules, but I as a cop I cannot control that.
532	Firstly, law enforcement officers such as myself have the duty to enforce laws that are in place. We do not aim to 'piss off' skateboarders or anyone else; if an area has no skateboarding signs, trespass warnings or other warnings in place, we must take action to ensure the safety of those in the area. Every situation is different.  Secondly, it is important to recognize that a victim mentality can lead to negative experiences; although laws are enforced, individuals have the power to decide how they react to these laws. Ultimately, how one feels is a choice that they make.
533	Firstly, as a police officer, I have the authority to remove skateboards from areas where there are posted signs prohibiting skateboarding, as well as areas where vandalism is common or where trespass warnings are posted. I do not set out to “piss off” skateboarders, but rather enforce the laws that have been applied to them. You may not be a problem, but the other dozen skateboarders before you could have been.  Secondly, I do not have control over a person’s emotions. It is up to individuals to chose how they react to a situation.
534	Firstly, as a law enforcement officer, I have the responsibility to ensure that laws are upheld. I cannot choose to simply ignore laws simply because they may inconvenience individuals. Laws are there to ensure public safety and to protect the community as a whole. Secondly, as a police officer, I must enforce laws and regulations imposed by the government. I cannot modify these laws to accommodate individuals’ preferences.   In terms of victim mentality, everyone has the choice of how they react to a situation. While I cannot control how individuals react, I can make sure that laws and regulations are upheld to ensure public safety.
535	Yes to an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example:  A car load of black or Hispanic kids is rolling around a primarily white neighborhood at 3am, plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good. I believe this is an acceptable type of profiling.  I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around a high-drug area; to control crime, such measures are necessary and I do not personally see it as a violation of one's rights.  Of course, people may call me racist for this opinion; however, to an open mind, it does make sense and is fair.
536	Yes to an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example: A car load of black or Hispanic kids are rolling around a lets say mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am, plates get run, and it’s pretty obvious they don’t live in the area and may be up to no good. I believe this is an acceptable type of profiling.  I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around the hood, in high-drug areas. Crime needs to be controlled, and I do not personally believe that it is a violation of one’s rights to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicious.  Of course, people will call me racist, but to an open mind, what I stated makes sense and is fair.
537	Yes to an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example: A car load of black or Hispanic kids are rolling around a mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am, plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good.

Crime needs to be controlled and I do not personally see it as a violation of one's rights to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicious. Of course, people will call me racist, but to an open mind, this makes sense and is fair.
538	Yes, to a certain extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense. For example, if law enforcement officers stop a car with people of a certain race or ethnicity who are driving around an area that is known to have higher levels of crime, it is reasonable to suspect that they may be up to no good and thus, it is appropriate to conduct a check. This type of profiling helps to control crime and I do not believe it is a violation of one's rights.
539	Yes to an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense. For example, if a car of mostly minority kids is driving around a primarily white neighborhood at 3 am, plates get run and it is clear that they do not live in the area and could be up to no good. I believe this is an acceptable type of profiling. Similarly, a car of suburban white boys driving around a high drug area could also be seen as profiling.  Crime needs to be controlled and I do not personally believe it is a violation of one’s rights to be stopped when they are deemed suspicious.
540	The government of Maharashtra imposed a ban on ladies’ bars as complaints had been received from housewives about their male family members spending money on female bartenders and not taking responsibility for their families. Additionally, criminal activities were also taking place at these bars. To put a stop to such activities, the government of Maharashtra implemented the ban.
541	You are incorrect, the ban is in place in Maharashtra as the government has received numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not fulfilling their family responsibilities. Additionally, criminal activities have taken place at these establishments, which is why the government has chosen to put a ban in place.
542	You are incorrect; the ban is in place in Maharashtra state, as the government received numerous complaints from housewives about male family members spending money on ladies' bars and not taking care of their families, as well as criminal activities taking place. Additionally, the government feared that such establishments could lead to an increase in crimes such as money laundering and drug trafficking. Thus, the government decided to impose a ban on these ladies' bars.
543	You are incorrect; the ban is only in Maharashtra. The government enacted the ban due to complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money at these bars and the criminal activities that took place there. This was to put a stop to such activity.
544	You are incorrect, the ban was only implemented in Maharashtra. The government had received numerous complaints from housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies’ bars and not taking care of the family, as well as criminal activities taking place at these bars. To put a stop to such activities, the government of Maharashtra imposed the ban.
545	Firstly, the winner of a war was often determined by the superior firepower of one nation over another, rather than through the sheer strength of one nation alone. While this could lead to a nation gaining the land as a result, this process was much more complex than simply who won the war.   Furthermore, while the Nation which lost the war might have lost the land, this was more so due to the outcome of the war being in favour of the victorious nation.  In other words, the victor gained the land through this outcome.
546	Firstly, the victor of war was typically granted the land according to ancient customs, which often involved direct conflict between nations. While some nations managed to assert their dominance over others over time, this process ultimately resulted in the loss of land for many tribes.  However, Native American tribes have contributed to the land in many ways, with more trees now present than at the time of Columbus’s landing. We also grow much of the food we need to survive.
547	First off, the ancient practice of war has been utilized by many nations to settle disputes over land, with the victor gaining control of the land. While there were some instances of chicanery, our forefathers were largely successful in the Indian Wars due to their tenacity, allowing them to gain control of the land. Over time, the Nations have maintained their presence on the continent, with more trees now than at the time of Columbus's landing. We are able to grow much of our food and utilize the land for survival.
548	First off, the right to land was usually determined by war, with the winner gaining control of the land. Although there were some instances of chicanery, our ancestors mostly won these wars, leading to the loss of land by the original nations.  As for trees, the continent had more at the time of Columbus's landing, with us growing most of the food to survive.
549	Firstly, the right to the land was often decided by war, with the victorious nation gaining the land. This was due to the fact that the strongest nation typically emerged victorious in these wars, leading to the loss of land by the original nation.  While some chicanery certainly occurred, the majority of land was lost due to this attrition.
550	Here’s another thing to consider...while some judges can be bought, they aren’t even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to be impartial and listen to the merits of each case separately, without considering their own political views. However, some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, feel they can change what they believe is wrong in the world, even though this goes against the law. This can be a cause for concern.
551	Here is another point to consider: while some judges can be bought, this is not their main role. Their main role is to be fair and impartial, to consider the merits of each case separately, as presented. However, some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, feel that they can take it upon themselves to enforce their personal beliefs on the law. This is a concern as it goes against the philosophy of the judiciary, as well as being worrisome.
552	Here's another thing to consider...while some judges can be bought, they are not the only issue. The philosophy of being a judge is to remain impartial, to consider the merits of each case separately and without bias. Unfortunately, some judges, especially some of the new Supreme Court Justices, have chosen to let their personal political beliefs influence their decisions, which is a serious concern.
553	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges can be bought, they are not the main issue. The philosophy for being a judge is to be impartial and listen to each case separately. However, some judges, including two Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to adhere to the law, going beyond their political views into the courtrooms. Worse still, this creates a risk of a single judge being able to influence the law.
554	Here is another factor to consider. While some judges can be bought, this is not their main issue. The philosophy behind being a judge is to be impartial, to weigh the cases individually and as presented. However, some judges, especially some new Supreme Court Justices, do not adhere to this approach; they let their personal political views influence their decisions. This is worrying as it can happen in any million.
555	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have fewer rights than women in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially.  If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it is not justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.
556	In many developed countries, women have the legal right to abortion in cases of unplanned pregnancy, allowing them to make decisions regarding their own reproductive rights. However, men are often denied any rights in these situations, such as the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist as well as the right to decline financial responsibility.   This runs contrary to the fact that women have such rights, and it is not fair to deny them this autonomy. Men should have the same rights as women in these situations, in order to ensure fairness and ensure that each parent is able to make their own decisions regarding their potential parenthood.
557	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have fewer rights than women in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially.   If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it is not reasonable to deny that choice from the biological father.
558	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have lesser rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially.   If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. The importance of involving both parents in the decision making process is undeniable, but legal right to choose should be extended to both parents in instances of potential parenthood.
559	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have fewer rights than women in terms of parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially.   If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it is not reasonable to take away that decision from the biological father.
560	I understand your viewpoint; however, I believe that abortion should be legal as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. It is important to keep in mind that abortion is an option for women and couples to reduce the risk of pregnancy, as well as to ensure the safety of the mother and the baby. As a society, we need to be respectful of a woman's choice and not judge her decision.
561	All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized, it's not a fully formed human, so it's no different than aborting a non-viable fetus. Although it's someone's body, if the mother wants to abort a pregnancy, it should be their choice. Religion shouldn't dictate whether or not a person can abort a pregnancy. As an alternative view, I'm open to hearing other opinions on this.
562	I understand your point of view. In some religions, abortion is seen as wrong as it involves ending a life, but I believe it is important to respect a person's right to choose whether or not they want to continue a pregnancy.
563	I understand your perspective and that abortion is a personal choice. From a legal standpoint, abortion is legal in many states, so people have the right to make that decision for themselves. Although abortion occurs during pregnancy, it is ultimately the woman’s body and she should have the autonomy to decide what is best for her.
564	I understand your perspective, especially since abortion is a highly debated issue. I believe that a woman should have the right to choose whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy, as it is her body and her decision. While I personally believe that life begins at conception, I understand that this is a highly subjective issue and that others may disagree.
565	I can understand that the adversarial judicial system has its advantages. It encourages both sides to present their evidence in a clear and organized manner, allowing the jury to make a better assessment of the facts. Additionally, it allows both sides to use emotional language to make their argument more persuasive, which can be useful when it comes to judging the strength of an argument.  Moreover, it relies on the jury to make an informed decision, which might be seen as a more accurate way of getting to the truth.
566	I can see how the adversarial judicial system may not always accurately get to the truth. It seems to depend more on how well the arguments are presented, and how effective the lawyers are in appealing to the jury. Additionally, the jury may not always have legal training, which could hinder their ability to assess the evidence correctly.   However, there are some benefits to this system. It allows for two sides to draw conclusions and attempt to influence the jury with emotional language, which could make it difficult to get to the truth.
567	I can see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth, as the judge and jury are able to weigh the evidence presented by both sides. While this system may be less rigid than other systems in terms of determining what is true, it does allow both sides to present their case and allows the judge and jury to decide which argument is more convincing.
568	I can understand the advantages of an adversarial judicial system in terms of giving both sides a fair opportunity to present their case, allowing the jury to reach an independent conclusion. However, it seems that the influence of the jury and the ability to reach the truth can be limited in this system, as the jury is often untrained individuals who must make a decision based on which argument is better presented.
569	Adversarial judicial systems have the benefit of allowing both sides to present their case and the facts to the court in a way that allows the judge and jury to weigh them equally. This allows for a more efficient method of determining the truth. Furthermore, having an experienced jury make decisions can provide a better way of getting at the truth than other systems.
570	I understand your concern and agree that environmental issues are a cause for concern. While I believe that humans will be able to survive whatever happens, society as a whole may collapse. I believe this could lead to a lower quality of life for humans, as well as a possibility of human extinction.
571	I believe that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and that humanity needs to take action to mitigate its effects. We need to make sustainable changes to our lifestyle in order for us to have a chance to survive as a species. Even if we do survive, I still believe that society as a whole could collapse. We could be left with a much more fragile and dangerous existence.
572	I believe that while humanity may be able to survive the next century, it is difficult to predict exactly what kind of global conditions we will face. Climate change and environmental degradation is an ever-present threat, and while we may be able to adapt and overcome, it is difficult to know exactly what kind of strains our society will have to face. I believe that while society could continue to exist, it is too difficult to predict the conditions we could face.
573	I believe that our current trajectory is likely to cause significant environmental damage that could have long-term implications for human populations. Although I do not believe that human extinction is imminent, I think it is possible that society could collapse, with humans existing in a Mad Max/The Road/The Book of Eli-type situation.
574	I believe that the human race will likely survive whatever happens, but society as we know it is likely to collapse. I think that humans will be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence.
575	A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.   By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire.    Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
576	*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*    By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the integration of our international cultures into our campus life and protecting the students' rights to have fun. We can also explore the idea of more non- racial specific party themes such as black light or tropical to help make the students feel more comfortable. In this way, we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students while doing minimal harm to the greek end.
577	A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.  By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire. This can cause great psychological distress to the students affected and may lead to further isolation and cultural alienation.   To avoid this, I believe that these parties should be banned in order to protect the integrity of our international and ethnical students.

By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a “joke” to those who attend in attire. This can have a serious impact on the mental wellbeing of students from different cultures.   I believe that more general themed parties should be enforced in order to respect and preserve the culture of these students.
580	The Wilhelm scream has been used in over 200 films, and while it may be a nostalgic element for some viewers, its use can be intrusive if it breaks the immersion of the scene. In some cases, it seems to be inserted without thought, which is not beneficial to the film.
581	I have often been taken out of films when the Wilhelm scream is used; it has been used in over 200 films and sometimes seems to be inserted arbitrarily, with little regard for how it affects the scene. While it is an 'in-joke', I believe its use has become too common for this to remain effective.
582	The Wilhelm scream has been used in over 200 films, and while it can be an effective tool for setting a scene, its heavy use in films can be distracting. It has become too familiar to the audience and can take away from the film's atmosphere.
583	Although I recognize its usage in over 200 films, the Wilhelm scream can be jarring and take me out of the scene. Often, it is used so clumsily that it seems as if the director is simply cramming it in without regards to its effect on the film.
584	It is understandable that the Wilhelm scream has been used in over 200 films as it has become widely recognizable. However, I believe that its use in films can be somewhat intrusive as it may pull the audience out of the scene, especially if it is used too forcefully.
585	In some cases, such as drug dealing or prostitution, it may be appropriate to set up stings in order to catch criminals, as these activities can pose a danger to the public. However, decriminalizing these activities is another matter.
586	For instance, prostitution stings should be illegal. And drug deal stings. Anything that does not have a victim, and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. (Although, I believe these both should be decriminalized, but that's neither here nor there). Setting people up for these crimes, to me seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Generally, it is not a good idea to criminalize activities such as these without an actual victim, as it can heavily impact individuals and their lives.
587	For instance, prostitution stings should be illegal. And drug deal stings. Anything that does not have a victim and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. (Although, I believe these should be decriminalized, but that is not the case). Setting people up for these crimes can lead to people being arrested for committing a crime without knowing it.

If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that is one thing. (Although, I believe these crimes should be decriminalized, but that is neither here nor there). Setting people up for these crimes, to me, seems like the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in.  These people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.
589	For example, stings to catch people engaging in prostitution or drug dealing should be illegal. Although I believe these activities should be decriminalized, this is not the case. Setting people up for these crimes by using entrapment techniques to catch them in the act could lead to innocent people being punished as they have not necessarily broken any laws.
590	Vladimir Putin has been increasingly assertive in asserting Russia’s geopolitical influence, often defying the democratic norms of the West. This is partially due to Putin’s determination to shape history in his own image, as he is willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his goals. His policies have been met with strong resistance from international bodies, but Putin seems unbothered by this. He is willing to impose his will on Russia and its policies regardless of the costs.
591	Vladimir Putin has acted aggressively to restore some of the influence of the Russian Federation, which has a history of imperial expansion. This has caused tensions with neighboring countries and the international community. Although the Russian people is largely loyal to his leadership, Putin's rule has been supported by authoritarian measures which have limited civil liberties and raised concerns about human rights. Moreover, his policies have not been fully democratically-determined and have instead been shaped largely by his own will.
592	The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin has led Russia since 1999, imposing his views on a country that is largely subordinate to his authority. The Russian people is largely compliant with this authoritarian leadership, and is willing to submit to his dictates in order to achieve national goals. Putin has strong determination in pursuing his own agenda and has shown no hesitation in disregarding international norms and conventions, with little regard for the human cost of his actions. His actions have had a significant impact on Russian foreign policy, which is largely shaped by his own preferences.
593	Russia under Vladimir Putin has taken a different path than the western countries, with its leadership and political system determined largely by the president. This has caused some tension between Moscow and the West, particularly in regards to international politics, with Russia standing alone on certain issues in defiance of international opinion. This has been the case particularly with regards to Putin's policies and actions in Ukraine and Syria. Although this has had a human cost, it appears that Putin is willing to go to any lengths to make history.
594	Russia's foreign policy is largely determined by Vladimir Putin's decisions, as the Russian people is traditionally obedient and Putin is willing to pursue former glory. Additionally, the Russian people is traditionally patriotic and willing to submit to an autocratic leadership, with international politics not fully democratically generated. Putin is determined to go his own way and take risks if necessary, which could lead to conflict with the West's values.
595	In terms of raw performance, the race car is superior to the dirt bike on most maps, as it has better acceleration and downforce that helps with momentum on hills. On maps like the beach and the cave, the dirt bike has an advantage due to its ability to corner better. However, on Highway and Rollercoaster, the race car is the better choice due to its better performance.
596	The race car is overall the better vehicle on most maps, with the exception of the moon, where the dirt bike has the advantage. On maps like the beach and the cave, the downforce of the race car keeps you grounded on the bigger hills, while on highway and roller coaster, it offers more stability.
597	Forgive any rambling, I will endeavour to stay within the 500 word limit. With the exception of the moon, the race car performs better than the dirt bike on all maps. On maps like the beach and the cave, the down force keeps you down on the big hills, and on highway and rollercoaster, the race car is better suited due to its better performance.
598	Forgive any rambling; I will aim to stay within the word limit. The race car is superior for most levels due to its downforce, which keeps your front end down on any hill. The exception is the Moon, where the dirt bike has the advantage due to its agility.
599	The race car is superior to the dirt bike on most maps, with the exception of the moon. Downforce keeps the race car grounded on hills, while the downforce on the dirt bike is less effective. The race car also has better momentum retention and is easier to control on hills.
600	First, Congress is aware of the benefits of the Department of Homeland Security's funding and presence, as it helps protect the nation and its people. Congress has continuously decided to keep the Department and its funding, as it is seen as providing some type of useful purpose.  Second, new security measures are implemented each year to ensure the safety of citizens, which could have potentially saved lives. While these measures may be inconvenient at times, they have likely been effective.
601	Firstly, the $8B is its budget, according to Forbes. If Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? I believe it serves the purpose of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving, with new security measures being introduced each year to improve security and reduce inconvenience. This has been done to ensure public safety.
602	First of all, I believe that the money given to the TSA by Congress has increased over time, providing more funding for the agency. This indicates that Congress sees some value in the agency and its services. Additionally, new security measures are put in place each year to improve safety, which could potentially save lives. This suggests that the agency is evolving to meet new challenges.
603	First of all, yes, the United States government collects billions of dollars in revenue every year. This revenue is used to pay for services and infrastructure that are provided by the federal government. Although this money helps to fund these services, it is not unlimited and Congress must periodically approve funding for certain programs to ensure their continuation. The Congress generally believes that these programs provide some sort of benefit to the country, otherwise they would be immediately removed. Additionally, new security measures are implemented every year to enhance safety, which may have saved lives.
604	First, $8B is a large amount of money, but it is a small percentage of the Department of Homeland Security's budget, which is approximately $40B. Additionally, Congress is responsible for setting the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, and they have chosen to keep the department's funding at this level, indicating that they believe the money is useful.  Second, new security measures are put in place each year to enhance security and prevent potential attacks. While these measures may be time-consuming and inconvenient, they have likely saved lives by improving security.
605	I believe that each successive love tends to be weaker than the first one, with the initial love usually being the strongest. This is somewhat similar to the experience of taking a drug for the first time; the initial experience leaves a lasting impression and it becomes harder to believe in “fairy tale” love stories.
606	I believe that every love we experience is stronger than the last, but that the intensity of the first love is difficult to match. This is like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time, where each love tends to be weaker than the last. My view is based on the idea that once we separate from our first love, the veil lifts and we begin to understand how hurtful love can be.
607	I believe that, over time, each love is stronger than the last. This is somewhat like chasing the dragon after trying a drug for the first time - the feeling never quite returns the same. However, my view is that, after separating from your first love, the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love fade away slowly.
608	I think that each love a person experiences becomes stronger over time, similar to the first love being the strongest; however, subsequent loves are unable to match the intensity of the first. This is like chasing the dragon - after taking a drug for the first time, where the veil falls and one's naive beliefs about love are replaced by more realistic ones.
609	I believe that every love we experience is stronger than the last, as we become more and more capable of forming deeper connections. The initial intensity of a first love is difficult to match, but with each subsequent relationship, our understanding of love deepens.
610	With all the hype around the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death, I'm reminded of how his death seemed to do something powerful. His death seemed to largely void out most, if not all, of the bad his actions and legacy are associated with in the public consciousness.   I know MJ is not an isolated case; it appears to be the general rule when it comes to people who die young. It seems that deification of the dead is becoming more common, especially given that their deaths seem to “erase” any bad memories of their actions from the public consciousness.   I believe it is important to remember and speak ill of the dead if they have done wrongful things, as their legacy should not be glossed over. Death should not be a way of completely washing away someone’s legacy.
611	With all the hype around the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson’s death, I’m reminded of how it affected his legacy. Dying aged just 50 erased most, if not all, of the bad things people remembered him for in the public consciousness.  It is a trend I have noticed with many young deaths - John F. Kennedy, Tupac Shakur and Andrew Breitbart have all experienced similar outcomes.  I think this goes against the idea that humanity has that our legacy should remain the same in death, which feels wrong and downplays the impact of our actions while alive.  I believe it should be acceptable to speak ill of the dead, as with the concept of never speaking ill of the dead being an adage, the memory of their actions on earth is overshadowed.
612	With all the hype surrounding the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson’s death, I’m reminded of how his death appears to have had a powerful effect. Dying seems to have erased most, if not all, of the negative attention he garnered in the public consciousness.  I recognize that this is not true of every case; Jackson is not an isolated example. However, I believe it goes against our nature to halt the impact of a person’s legacy simply because of their death. It seems wrong to me that death is able to clear away a person’s bad deeds with no one left to speak of them. It feels like the memory of their acts on Earth is being diminished in this way.   I believe it is acceptable to speak ill of the dead, in cases where they have done wrong things, and their legacy should not be cleansed in this way.
613	With all the attention paid to the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson’s death, I am reminded of how his death seems to have changed the public perception of his legacy. Although there is understandably a sense of finality when someone dies young, I believe it is wrong for their legacy to be erased in such a way. While I acknowledge that the dead should not be spoken ill of, I believe there should be space to speak critically of their actions, as this allows us to honour their legacy while acknowledging their actions on earth.
614	With all the hype surrounding the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson’s death, I’m reminded of how his death seems to have wiped out much of the bad press he accumulated in the public conscience. Dying young has the effect of erasing one’s past transgressions, at least in the public eye.  I believe this goes against the idea of justice and respect for the deceased; it removes their legacy’s accountability, something that should not be done. While death does not permanently erase a person’s past, it makes it easier for the public to forget the bad things they did while alive, especially if the death happens young.   I think it is important to remember and acknowledge the bad things a person did while alive, even after their death; the respect and justice for the deceased should be upheld.
615	We have increased the rights of convicts more in recent years than ever before, including the right to live. While I recognize that people make mistakes and errors can occur, I believe that we have collectively eroded our moral standards by making exceptions to this. I fundamentally oppose the notion that society should guarantee certain individuals the right to life, especially if it puts another individual’s life in jeopardy. This is a judgement call that I believe should be made by society as a whole, rather than the government.
616	We have become more lenient with convicts' rights in recent years, with some states allowing greater freedoms than ever before. While I recognize the importance of second chances, I believe that certain actions should come with permanent consequences, as I believe we have fundamentally compromised our moral integrity by making exceptions to this. While I recognize that every individual has the right to life, I believe that when it comes to putting someone else's life in jeopardy, it is my opinion that society as a whole would be better off if you were dead.
617	We have made exceptions to this in the past, and while I recognize that everyone makes mistakes, I believe that some actions should have permanent consequences. I believe it is necessary to balance the scales in order to preserve the greater good of society as a whole.  In cases where the action endangers another individual’s life, society as a whole is better off if the individual’s life is taken.
618	I understand that we have granted more rights to convicts in recent years, which allows some leniency in terms of punishment. However, I believe that certain actions should have permanent consequences, as we have somewhat compromised our morals in allowing exceptions. We all have the right to life, but if we are willing to take that away from someone else, then we have proven ourselves to be a net negative influence on society.
619	We have given more rights to convicts than in the past, and while I acknowledge that people make mistakes, I believe that some actions should have permanent consequences. I believe that, as a society, we have compromised ourselves by making exceptions to this. It is my view that every individual has a right to life, but that if you put another individual’s life in danger, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact to society and that, as a whole, we would all be better off if you were dead.
620	My parents argue that having family around to provide emotional support and stability is important for a child's development, which I agree with. I believe that the relationships and support that I have with my immediate family can be just as important and meaningful as having long-term relationships with relatives.
621	I understand my family’s role in my life is important and that I need to have some level of connection with them, but I personally don’t feel the need to have a strong relationship with them. I believe it is more important to have a strong connection with my immediate surroundings, such as my friends and peers, rather than family members. I can still receive support from my family, even though I might not necessarily need it or want it.
622	My parents argument is that my family may not be around forever and that they would do anything for me. I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for me. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
623	EDIT: I understand and accept that my family is not necessarily permanent and that my parents will do anything to help me. I acknowledge that this could be the case for any stranger, but it does not have to be the case for me personally. I am not close to them and do not need their help.
624	I understand that my family will not be around forever, and while I appreciate the concern, I personally do not need their help or support. I can make my own choices in life and it is up to me to take care of myself.
625	Underage individuals may still attempt to purchase alcohol despite the requirement of showing an ID. This can lead to violations of the law that are difficult to enforce, depending on the particular situation, and is an inconvenience for both the business and customer. It is understandable why this policy is in place, but it does not make sense from a rational standpoint.
626	So, if a customer forgets their ID but is not purchasing the alcohol, requiring them to show ID makes no sense from a business standpoint. The customer could simply walk out of the store, go to a different register or to the next store over, allowing them to make the purchase without any real liability on the part of the store. This rule could deter customers from purchasing the alcohol at the store in the first place.
627	So, if a person forgets their I.D. but is not purchasing alcohol, requiring them to show I.D. is both a useless and inconvenient policy. While it makes sense why this policy is in place, it still does not make sense from a rational perspective.
628	There are ways around these measures, such as a person buying alcoholic products for someone under 21. This could result in liability for the seller, depending on the law. This rule can discourage people from buying alcohol at the store, although this may not be the intent of the policy.
629	If an individual is not allowed to purchase alcoholic products for another person who does not have identification, this can be both inconvenient and impractical as there is no guarantee that the individual cannot simply buy the products and then walk back out of the store, or go to another store over to circumvent the system. While this policy may protect the stores from legal liability, it can still be an issue of inconvenience for customers.
630	One of my favorite movies of all time! I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, thus severely underpaying his most vital employees.   Other than that: - The Park would be a major boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it opens shop.  - It would motivate kids across the globe to venture into science disciplines.  - It would further our understanding of our planet.   The possibilities are endless. As long as we invest adequately in the project.

632	One of my favorite movies of all time! I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, resulting in a lower salary for his key employees.   Other than that:   - The Park would be a major boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it opens shop.  - It would motivate kids across the globe to venture into science disciplines.  - It would further our understanding of our planet.   The possibilities are endless. We should prioritize a high salary for these employees so the Park can reach its full potential.

634	One of my favorite movies of all time! I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, resulting in a potentially higher payroll cost which could have restricted growth opportunities for the Park.    Other than that:   - The Park could provide a boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic and any other nation where it opens.  - It could further our understanding of the planet.  - It could motivate kids to pursue science disciplines.   The possibilities are certainly endless, but construction and maintenance costs must be considered to ensure the Park's sustained success.
635	Video games can be a great form of entertainment and an outlet for people to relax, however, if not played in moderation it can take over a person’s life and social skills, which can impact their life drastically. Parents should monitor their children’s usage of video games, especially when children are becoming consumed by it. This can be done by setting limits and playing with them to ensure a healthy balance in their lives.
636	Video games can be a great way to entertain and engage people, however, it is important to monitor children’s usage, as too much exposure can affect their lives and social skills. It is also important to ensure children use video games in a moderate way to avoid any health issues or issues with social skills.
637	Video games can have a profound impact on people's lives, particularly for children who can become consumed by them and neglect social skills and other activities. Parents and guardians should monitor children's use of games and enforce limits to ensure balance in their lives.
638	Video games can be a great form of entertainment, however, they can easily consume people's lives if not used in moderation. This can be especially detrimental for children, as it can take over their lives and social skills. It is therefore important for parents to monitor their children's usage and ensure it is kept in balance with other aspects of their lives. We must ensure that video games are used in a balanced and healthy manner to avoid any long-term negative impacts on a child's development.
639	Video games can be a powerful and enjoyable form of entertainment, however it is important to monitor and enforce limits on gameplay to prevent overuse and ensure balance in a person's life. Parents should ensure that children are playing games in moderation, as too much gameplay can impact social skills and take over a person's life. It is important to take preventative measures to ensure children are not adversely affected by gameplay.
640	It may not be the best way to communicate with people, as there are other methods such as phones, email, and instant messenger, but these apps can provide an additional way of sharing experiences and emotions. Additionally, the app may offer convenience and a sense of connection for users.
641	It may be beneficial for some people to use social media platforms as a way of staying connected and sharing their experiences, but I personally do not find these apps useful or enjoyable. I think there are better ways to communicate with people, such as phones, emails, instant messengers, video calls, and video chats. Additionally, I do not think it is a good idea to post about personal matters and make them public.
642	I believe that social media apps have limited value in allowing people to share their experiences and emotions with others, as there are better ways to communicate such information, such as using phones, emails, instant messengers, video calls, and video chats. Additionally, the apps do not have any positive impact or meaning and are not enjoyable to use.
643	While apps like these can be useful for staying in touch with people and sharing experiences, I believe there are better ways of communication. Social media apps have limited functionality and are not the best way to reach people. I also question the need to share such information with others.
644	I believe the app has limited benefits as compared to other forms of communication. While phones, email, instant messenger, video calls and video chats provide greater convenience and flexibility, the app offers no unique benefits and does not provide an enjoyable experience. I also question the need to share such personal information with others.
645	Iraq has shown that strong authoritarian rule can be necessary in some situations. If the administration had been more decisive, Saddam could have been removed from power without triggering chaos in the region. Running a large territory requires a strong hand.
646	The Iraqi experience has demonstrated that in some situations, dictatorships can provide stability and order, which can be beneficial for the people and the region as a whole. It requires a strong leader to rule over a large area such as Iraq, which has a 160,000 square-mile area.
647	Iraq has demonstrated that repressive dictatorships can have a role in some countries, as evidenced by Saddam's removal from power. It takes a strong hand to govern a large area such as Iraq, and the U.S. administration clearly realized this.
648	Iraq has highlighted the need for strong leaders in some instances, as these countries require a centralized power to ensure stability. The U.S. administration should have had a Delta team in place to extract Saddam and ensure his safe transfer to the capital, which can be challenging to govern given its size.
649	Iraq has demonstrated that dictatorships have an important role to play in some regions of the world. Although it is undesirable to have strong leaders in charge of large areas, it is sometimes necessary to do so in order to maintain stability. Saddam's reign over a 160,000 square mile area was no doubt difficult.
650	As powerful as Superman is, he is vulnerable to psionic attacks, making Professor X, Phoenix, or Apocalypse a formidable foe. Batman has no powers and relies on gadgets, giving Magneto the upper hand. The Flash's main power is his speed, making him relatively easy to take down.
651	As powerful as Superman is, he is vulnerable to psychic powers, which Professor X and the Phoenix can use to control him. Batman has no superpowers, only gadgets, but Magneto could still pose a threat to him. Similarly, the Flash's speed is his only power, making him vulnerable to defeat. However, Professor X could still take them both out with psychic powers.
652	As powerful as Superman is, he is vulnerable to psionic powers, making Professor X, Phoenix or Apocalypse a potential threat. Similarly, Batman has no powers, limiting his capabilities compared to the Flash, who is limited to running. However, Professor X could potentially take them all down if he collaborates with other Marvel characters.
653	As powerful as Superman is, he is vulnerable to psionic powers, meaning Professor X (or Phoenix, or Apocalypse) could control or trap him. Batman has no powers, but instead relies on gadgets. Magneto could render him helpless.  Meanwhile, The Flash is able to run, but Professor X could take him down easily as well.
654	As powerful as Superman is, he is vulnerable to psionic powers, making Professor X or the Phoenix, or even Apocalypse, a potential threat. Additionally, Batman has no powers, relying instead on gadgets, which could make Magneto a formidable foe. The Flash runs, making it difficult for him to defend against a solo attack from Professor X.  In general, Professor X could potentially take down all three of them.
655	Yes, it WILL recover if the government stops intervening and its 'bail out' measures are removed. Such intervention caused a severe and prolonged market downturn, which was compounded by union laws passed at the time, which hinder our ability to be competitive. It is important for lawmakers to take relevant economic history into account during schooling.
656	Yes, it WILL recover if the government stops its intervention and bailouts. Such intervention can have long-term negative effects, as we have seen with the instituting of union laws, which has limited our competitiveness. It is important that lawmakers take economic history into account when making decisions in high school.
657	Yes, it will recover given the government's less interventionist policies. Such policies helped stem the economic downturn in the past and Union laws have impeded our competitiveness. It is important for lawmakers to take relevant history classes in high school to be aware of such causes and effects.
658	Yes, it will eventually recover if the government reduces its intervention and provides less aid. This has the potential to create a market downturn which could become long-term and devastating; one example of this is the introduction of union laws, which have restricted the country's competitiveness. It is important for lawmakers to take relevant economic history into account when designing policy in school.
659	Yes, it will recover if the government stops intervening and provides less economic support. This caused the market drop to become much worse, and some of the laws that restricted labor mobility were enacted, which has limited our ability to be competitive. Ideally, lawmakers should take economic history lessons in high school to be aware of these consequences.
660	I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane. It is our right, and perhaps even our duty, to evolve and shape our own destiny in order to ensure our own survival.
661	I hear all too often that science is 'playing God'. We as a species have superceded the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition.

If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane. Life itself is playing God, as its our ability to adapt and manipulate our biology that ensures our survival.
662	Through our advancements in science and technology, humans have acquired the capacity to interfere with the natural process of evolution. This raises the question of whether or not we should manipulate our evolution in order to ensure our survival as a species. While natural selection has traditionally played a role in our success as a species, our stability as a society gives us the ability to plan our evolution in order to suit our needs.
663	We have the power to shape our own evolution and that of our species as a whole, which is our right and responsibility. The human genome has been decoded since 1999, allowing us to manipulate it to best suit our needs. Such control has enabled us to improve our quality of life and minimize the effects of diseases, although we remain vulnerable to them. Thus, our ability to plan our evolution is key in order to ensure our survival. Natural selection has its limits, and it is our choice to extend it. God gave us the freedom to choose our destiny and it is our right and obligation to determine it.
664	In our attempt to improve human life, we must consider the potential implications of genetic manipulation. While our technology has advanced to the point that we can manipulate the human genome, it is important that we carefully consider the consequences of such action. As a species, we must ensure that our evolution is guided in a way that allows us to continue thriving. Moreover, we must remember that nature has its own way of selecting the strong, and while we have the advantage of controlling our evolution, we must also recognize that it could lead to detrimental consequences if we are not careful. We must carefully evaluate our decisions if we want to ensure the survival of our species.
665	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics to ensure that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, there is no guarantee that the shots were fired from a particular gun, which could pose a risk. It is important to be able to track the guns to ensure public safety.
666	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued, so that the gun and any bullets fired from it can be traced, there is no way to ensure accountability. This presents a significant risk that these guns could be used without repercussions. It is important to ensure that gun owners are held responsible for the ammunition they fire.
667	Unless guns are tested for ballistics before being issued, it is difficult to trace the bullets if they are fired, as there is no way to track them to the owners. This poses a potential risk, as it is similar to giving someone a powerful weapon without any accountability.
668	To ensure public safety, gun ownership and use should be subject to strict regulations, including ballistic testing of guns before licensure to ensure that shots can be traced back to owners. This enables authorities to hold owners of guns accountable for their shots.
669	Gun ownership carries certain risks, as the gun itself may not be traceable if not registered. To ensure gun shots can be traced back to the owners, ballistics tests must be conducted on all issued guns to ensure the ammunition is traceable. This would ensure gun owners can be held accountable for their shots.
670	I live in Southern California, where there are pizza delivery services available until 3am. Personally, I would prefer to visit Del Taco over Taco Bell, as Taco Bell was more popular in the 1960s, when tacos were cheaper at $1 for five tacos.
671	I live in Southern California, where there are pizza delivery services available until 3am. I would prefer to visit Del Taco instead of Taco Bell, as Taco Bell was once a separate company.  In our high school days, tacos were as low as $1 each.
672	I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services available until 3am, plus I would rather go to Del Taco anytime over Taco Bell.  In the 60s, Taco Bell was a popular option for teenagers; tacos were 5 for a dollar back then.
673	I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services available until 3am. Personally, I would prefer to go to Del Taco anytime over Taco Bell.   In the 1960s, Taco Bell was popular among us in high school days; tacos were priced at $5 for a single unit.
674	I live in Southern California, where there are pizza delivery services available until 3am. Personally, I would prefer to visit Del Taco over Taco Bell. Taco Bell was originally better in the 1960s, with five tacos for a dollar.
675	I believe that Principals do obtain the right to search in certain situations, such as drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on them. This is outlined in the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and the Canadian Charter of Rights. Additionally, these restrictions ensure the safety of the entire student body and keep drugs and crime away.
676	I believe the Principal does have the right to search students in order to ensure safety, including drug tests in some cases. However, there are limits as outlined in the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) and the Canadian Charter of Rights, which provides additional safeguards to keep the student body safe and free from dangerous substances.
677	I see that there is some debate about the extent to which Principals are given search rights. To clarify, Principals do receive these rights in certain situations, such as when drugs or crime are reported, or when sniffer dogs are used. This is outlined in the Criminal Code, the YCJA and the Canadian Charter of Rights. This ensures that the student body is kept safe and away from any harmful substances.
678	I see that there's actually no argument, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'Yes' argument.  Even though Principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something.  There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code. YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws).  Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
679	I see that there is some disagreement regarding the extent to which principals can search students. To clarify, principals do obtain the right to search students in certain circumstances, such as when drugs or crimes are reported or when sniffer dogs are used. This right is outlined in the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and the Canadian Charter of Rights. This ensures that the student body is kept safe and away from harmful substances.
680	Parents must set clear boundaries and expectations for their children in order to ensure good behavior. While offering rewards or incentives can help encourage desired behavior, parents should aim to provide consistent discipline and guidance without having to offer rewards in order to reinforce compliance.
681	First off, bribing a child is wrong; parents need to set clear expectations and provide consistent discipline to ensure that children understand what is expected of them and that they are willing to comply. While this could involve providing rewards or incentives in some cases, parents should make sure that they are firm yet fair in their approach.
682	First off, bribing a child is not advisable as it can undermine a child's trust and respect for their parents. Instead, parents should provide consistent and age-appropriate explanations as to why the rules are in place and why certain actions are expected of them. This helps children understand why they need to comply and improves the chances of them doing so.
683	I believe that children need to understand the consequences of their actions, and if punished in a reasonable manner, they are more likely to understand why they need to do something. It may be helpful to provide an explanation as to why they need to do something or to express that you are open to their feedback and input on the situation. This can help them understand why they need to do something, while also reinforcing your authority as a parent.
684	First, it is important to provide children with structure, guidance and limits, so that they know what is expected of them and can learn to obey their parents/authorities. This is done through consistent verbal guidance and enforcement, rather than using bribes to entice them to do what you want. While bribing a child might make the situation easier in the short term, it is not a suitable method to use, as it is not appropriate to reward a child in this way for compliance.
685	I have had this discussion with my brother numerous times. I believe that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers.  First, there are multiple definitions for the word. 'elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc.' certainly does not describe the band, nor does 'impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc.'. But what about'supreme or outstanding'?  Of course, there is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I believe, would be that the name does not describe the band.
686	I've had this discussion with my brother various times. I think that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers. While it may be subjective, I believe that the name does not fully capture the essence of the band's music, which I feel could be more powerfully described in a different way.
687	I've had this discussion with my brother several times. While the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band in my opinion, there are multiple definitions for the word. "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc." certainly does not describe the band, nor does "impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc." Though I do think that "supreme or outstanding" could be applicable. It is a matter of opinion, but the general consensus is that the name does not fully capture the band's sound.
688	I've had this discussion with my brother various times. While some definitions of the word'sublime' describe the band accurately, I believe that the name does not do justice to their music. It is understandable that each person has their own opinion on this, but the general consensus is that the name does not fully capture the band's sound.
689	I've had this discussion with my brother multiple times. The name "Sublime" may be suitable for some bands, but I believe it does not accurately describe the band to which it refers. There are multiple definitions for the word, such as "elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc." However, this does not accurately represent the band. Furthermore, I believe the name does not accurately capture the band's essence.
690	Starting bartending courses early can help the student learn the skills sooner rather than later. It does not necessarily mean that they will become drunks later in life; it depends on the person's discipline. It is important to include an understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects in bartending courses.
691	Yes, there is value in starting young in terms of skill acquisition; however, this does not necessarily mean that the individual will be a drinker later in life. It is still up to the person’s own discipline. In terms of bartending courses, it would be beneficial to have a better understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects.
692	Yes, it is important to start young in order to perfect skills sooner; however, this does not guarantee that a person will become a drunk later in life. It is more a matter of their own discipline. Including an understanding of alcohol and its effects could be beneficial.
693	Starting young could mean mastering bartending sooner, as it takes time to perfect. It is up to the individual's discipline. There are young drunks who were never bartenders, but bartending courses can include an understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects.
694	Yes, it is beneficial for young people to learn bartending skills early on, as it can give them an edge in perfecting their craft. It does not necessarily mean that they will be drinking alcohol later in life; it is still up to the individual's own discipline. Bartending courses should include an understanding of the effects of alcoholic beverages.
695	The belief that Jesus was married is based on the interpretation of a few passages of the Bible that state that Jesus had brothers and sisters, which some interpret to mean that Jesus was married. However, this interpretation is not accepted by all scholars and the notion that Jesus was married is largely disputed. Additionally, the accounts of Jesus' death and resurrection are based on the testimony of the apostles, who claimed to have seen Jesus after his death and resurrection, which serves as the basis of the Christian faith.
696	To begin with, it is important to note that there are different accounts of Jesus’ life and death. In the New Testament, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present four different accounts of Jesus’ life and ministry. In addition, the writings of Paul, Peter, and James provide additional information about Jesus. While some of these accounts match in certain details, there are also some differences. For example, in the canonical Gospels, Jesus is described as being crucified, while in the Gospel of John, Jesus is described as being raised from the dead. Overall, this provides some evidence that the canonical Gospels may not be entirely reliable, as they do not always agree on certain details. This, in turn, raises questions as to the accuracy of these accounts.
697	Jesus was known to have been married to Mary Magdalene, and was subsequently widowered when she died. There is no concrete evidence to suggest that he was not married. However, no record of his marriage has been found in any documents. It is also noted that his followers, the disciples, had to be sent out to spread the word of Christianity due to his death. Jesus could have been married and had children, but there is no definitive evidence to suggest this.
698	It is true that Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate and that his death was confirmed by the Jewish leaders, as indicated in the Bible. It is also true that Pilate was reluctant to sentence Jesus and that Pilate's wife begged him to release Jesus, but Pilate ultimately had the decision finalized based on the Jewish leaders' insistence. Additionally, the Roman soldiers did not find Jesus guilty of any crime. Jesus was most likely executed due to the religious tensions between the Jews and the Romans. This incident is also mentioned in the Bible.
699	Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption? Marriage was common among Jews at the time, so it is likely that Jesus was married, even though there is no confirmation in the Gospels. Scholars generally agree that Jesus was married, as this would have been the cultural norm at the time.
700	The popular belief is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is generally limited to short-term memory. However, it is possible that some dogs are able to form long-term memories of certain events or experiences, such as the reunion with their owner after being apart for a significant period of time. Thus, the dog's reaction to the owner's return could be stronger compared to a stranger, indicating a memory of the event that is not limited to short-term memory.
701	The popular belief is that dogs have short term memory capacity, but it is possible that the example with the child returning home is an example of conditioning, rather than memory. If a dog is successfully paper trained or kennelled, this could be termed as conditioning. In the case of the child returning home after being away for six months, the dog's reaction could be explained by the fact that the dog has formed an emotional bond with the child over a period of time, which could explain the prolonged reaction and the emotional attachment displayed by the dog.
702	The popular belief is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is usually limited to short term memory. This could be seen in cases where the dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through paper training or kenneling, which is termed conditioning. In the example above, it is possible that conditioning is taking place, rather than memory, as the dog is only able to remember the situation for a short period of time.  However, when a family member returns after being away for several months, the dog shows enthusiasm and displays lasting affection, suggesting that some form of memory may be taking place.
703	It is possible that the dog remembers the scent of the original owner after six months, as this could explain the dog’s more enthusiastic reaction upon reuniting with them. This suggests that the dog has a longer-term memory, rather than just conditioning.
704	It is possible that the dog in this example is demonstrating a form of short-term memory, as it is capable of remembering the scent of its owner even after several months apart. However, it is also possible that the dog is simply conditioned to react more strongly when it has been reunited with its owner after a longer period of time. Furthermore, the shorter the time period that the owner has been away, the less evident this reaction is.
705	I believe that before having children, prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and intelligence tests to ensure that the children have a good foundation to build a successful life upon. While there may be cases where parents are not as intellectually gifted, this will help ensure that children have the best possible start in life.
706	I believe that before having children, couples should be required to pass background and IQ tests in order to provide their children with the best foundation and chance of success. There are cases where parents may be lacking in intelligence, but these cases are rare and generally speaking, intelligence is key to positive outcomes.
707	I believe that before having children, prospective parents should be required to pass background and IQ tests, as I believe that children need a strong foundation in order to have a successful start in life. However, this is not always the case; in some instances, the parents may be less intelligent and the children could still be successful. We need more intelligence in the world.
708	I believe that before having children, prospective parents should be required to pass background and IQ tests, as it is important for children to have a good foundation to have a successful life. Although there may be exceptions, generally speaking, children have the potential to change the world for the better, and we need more intelligent people.
709	I believe prospective parents should be required to pass background and IQ tests before having children in order to give the youngsters a good foundation and increase the number of smart people in the world.
710	Marriage is an important institution which should be respected and celebrated as it helps to create a safe and healthy environment for children to grow up in.  In marriage, a man and a woman are able to form a bond which can help grow a family, providing a continuous lineage and giving children a stable home life.
711	Marriage is an important institution as it enables children to have stable family relationships and helps the continuation of the family unit.  Marriage is also essential for raising happy and healthy children, which makes it special compared to other arrangements.  It is better to have a man and a woman in a relationship rather than two men or two women, which could limit the growth of family branches.  Therefore, marriage should be respected and preserved.
712	Marriage is an important institution, as it is the optimal arrangement for raising children, both in terms of providing a stable family environment and promoting their long-term wellbeing. Marriage between a man and a woman helps to form these family units, rather than having multiple branches of the family tree. Thus, marriage is a better option than other alternatives.
713	Marriage is an important institution that provides the best environment to raise children. Two married parents can provide a stable home life for a child and help them to grow up healthy and happy. It is also important for the continuity of the family unit. If marriage is not allowed to happen, then there is no extension of the family tree.
714	Marriage is an important institution as it is an ideal arrangement for raising children, providing them with stable family units and safeguarding their wellbeing. Couples of the same-sex are unable to biologically produce children, thus limiting the possibilities of a family tree. Therefore, marriage should be respected and preserved to allow for optimal growth of families.
715	Our monetary supply cannot be allowed to continuously increase without limits, as this can lead to hyperinflation and another economic downturn.  Giving a government the power to print money that is not backed by anything increases the risk of stealthy currency devaluation, which has caused the collapse of every fiat currency system in history.
716	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely, and if allowed to continue, the result could be hyperinflation and another depression.  When a government is given the ability to print money without it being backed by anything, it can lead to stealthy debasement of the currency and eventual economic collapse. This has happened in every fiat currency system implemented in history.
717	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely; if allowed to, the result could be hyperinflation and another economic downturn. Governments are tempted to print fiat currency, which can lead to a loss of purchasing power and economic collapse. This has happened throughout history, and it is important to learn from it to prevent similar occurrences.
718	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely; if left unchecked, the result could be hyperinflation and another depression. Governments have consistently been unable to resist the temptation of hyperinflating the money supply, which has led to catastrophic results in the past.
719	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely; if allowed to, the result could be hyperinflation and another depression. Governments have the potential to abuse such powers by printing more money, which renders currency useless. This has happened in the past, and could have serious implications for a nation’s economy.
720	Yes. Yesterday, the average number of new debates posted was around 8 to 9 per day. This can be managed by either having them filtered in a bucket or some other method, allowing people time to read and respond to the current debates. This ensures increased engagement and viewership.
721	I believe that there should be an upper limit on the number of posts that can be viewed at a single time, as this gives people the chance to read and respond to the posts. It may be possible to use a filtered bucket to achieve this. This could help improve engagement with current debates and give them more visibility.
722	Yes, generally there should be a limit on the number of current debates that can be posted at a time in order to give people an opportunity to read and respond to them. This can be done through a filter or some other mechanism to ensure debates have sufficient exposure.  There are currently around 8 to 9 debates posted per day which is too much for the current open debates, leading to less people reading and responding to them.
723	Yes, 12 new debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The average number of new debates created in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day.  This provides opportunities for debaters to engage with current debates, which is beneficial for increasing their readership. To ensure this continues, there should be some sort of filter, such as a list of recently created debates, that people can view before choosing which one to engage with.
724	Yes, as of yesterday (the 12th), the average number of new debates posted per day has been around 8 to 9. This number is higher than in previous weeks, and it would be beneficial to give people time to read and respond to current debates. It is important to balance this with some limits, such as a filtered bucket or something similar. This will ensure that debates are not removed too quickly from the list and thus limit reader engagement.
725	iPhone undoubtedly symbolizes the modern era more so than BlackBerry, as it appeals to a more diverse demographic, including young adults, active individuals and those with varying levels of wealth. iPhone's capabilities allow it to reach a wide range of customers, from those who want to listen to music to those who want to participate in the latest technological trends. BlackBerry has traditionally targeted an elite demographic. With the iPhone, this has changed, allowing us to be a part of the elite.
726	The iPhone is popular with a wide range of consumers, appealing to a younger, more adult, and more affluent demographic than the Blackberry. This gives the iPhone greater reach than the Blackberry, which has traditionally targeted an elite audience. The iPhone offers greater versatility for its users, allowing them to listen to music and use applications while retaining its modern appeal.
727	The iPhone has broader appeal than the Blackberry, as it is more suitable for a wider range of consumers. This is due to its ability to reach out to a younger, more adult, more active, and wealthier market. The Blackberry has traditionally targeted an elite, and its features make it more suitable for people who want to be connected and enjoy music.
728	The iPhone appeals to a wide range of people, including young adults, adults, active people, and those who are both rich and less rich. Additionally, it offers more options for entertainment than the BlackBerry, making it more attractive to the younger generation. The BlackBerry has traditionally targeted an elite audience, while the iPhone has increased this demographic.
729	The iPhone has a much broader appeal than the Blackberry. It is designed to appeal to a younger, more diverse audience, with features that make it accessible to a variety of users, including young adults, adults, active people, and those with less wealth. The Blackberry, on the other hand, has always targeted an elite segment of the population. With the iPhone, we have the advantage of being able to play games and listen to music as well.
730	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. However, I would argue that the United States has had a larger influence on modern popular music. Blues and Jazz, which originated in the US, are the bedrock of modern popular music and have been essential in shaping popular music from the UK since the late 70s and early 80s. Without them, there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones, or any other major British band before then.
731	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. However, I would argue that the US has been a major source of music innovation. Blues and Jazz, which are widely regarded as the foundations of modern popular music, were born in the US and have had a great influence on music in the UK since the late 1960s and early 1970s. Without these genres, it is unlikely that the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and other major British bands of the 1960s and 1970s would have had the same level of success. The US clearly leads where the UK follows and adapts.
732	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. However, I would argue that the United States has been the birthplace of greater music. Blues and Jazz, which are acknowledged as some of the earliest forms of popular music, originated in the US. Without these styles, the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and other British bands of the 1960s and 1970s would not have had the same levels of success. Hip-hop and punk are also American art forms which have had an influence on the UK music scene since the late 1970s. In terms of popular music, the US has led where the UK follows and adapts.
733	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. However, I would argue that America has played a key role in developing modern popular music. Blues and Jazz originated in the US and were key influences on the development of British music, with the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and other British bands of the 60s and 70s forming part of a larger British scene that adapted and followed the evolution of American music. Without Blues and Jazz, the modern British music scene would not exist.
734	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music. However, I would argue that America has been a major force in the development of popular music. Blues and Jazz, which are widely seen as the bedrocks of modern popular music, originated in the United States, and these genres played an integral role in influencing the British music scene from the 1960s onwards. Without these styles, we would not have The Beatles, Rolling Stones, or any other major British band prior to 1977. Furthermore, Hip-hop and Punk are both American art-forms that have had a major influence on the UK music scene in more recent years. In terms of popular music, the United States has led in innovation, while the UK has followed and adapted.
735	Obama has shown strong judgment in times of crisis, has a commitment to building a green economy and is focused on helping all Americans, not just the wealthy. He is also more curious and open to new ideas compared to McCain. Overall, Obama is more suited to be President compared to McCain.
736	Obama has shown strong judgment in crisis situations, and a strong commitment to building a green economy. He is also Curious and cares about all people, not just the wealthy. McCain, on the other hand, has not kept up with changes in the system and has not been as Curious as Obama. He has also moved away from some of his own positions during the campaign, which shows a lack of trustworthiness.
737	Obama has shown strong leadership, good judgment and a commitment to addressing the fiscal crisis. He has also taken a strong stand on climate change, showing a desire to build a green economy. McCain has failed to keep pace with changes in the economy and has been out of step with the times. He has also taken questionable positions during this election, even going so far as to steal some of Obama’s positions. He lacks curiosity, has too often gone along with the system and has been narrow in his focus.
738	Obama has shown strong judgment in difficult times and has a curious mind set that enables him to think creatively about solving problems. He is committed to building a green economy and wants to deliver services to all Americans, not just the wealthy. McCain has been a steady presence in times of crisis and has some good ideas, but he has not been as innovative or effective as Obama in terms of policy implementation.  Obama is the better choice for president.
739	Obama has demonstrated strong leadership and judgment in tackling the economic crisis, showing a commitment to sustainable economic growth and a green economy. He has also shown a willingness to think outside the box and be curous, which is necessary to lead the US in a new direction. McCain, on the other hand, has failed to keep up with changing times and has instead clung to outdated views, which has left the US vulnerable to economic downturns. His policies also fail to address the needs of the American people and the environment.
740	I believe that it was a learning experience for our country. Without prohibition, we cannot be sure what would happen in the future. I think that having the prohibition law allowed us to see that it did not work, giving us a better chance to decide in such cases. While it was not a completely positive experience, I do not believe it was a completely negative one for our country.

745	Garry- No, I would not want to.  1 - Although being able to see friends and family is beneficial, being physically separated for a long time can be difficult.  2 - Although living longer has its benefits, being sick and unable to move around can be difficult.  3 - Although death is not pleasant, being able to end suffering is beneficial.
746	Garry - No, I wouldn't want to.  1 - You won't be able to see your friends and family if you were alive for a long time.  2 - You will be so old that moving around will become increasingly difficult. You may even be sick, which could be difficult to cope with.  (Death is better than this)  3 - Even if you feel the pain, death may not be an option due to the physical suffering this could cause.
747	Garry - No, I would not want to.  1 - Even if you are able to see your friends and family from a long distance, you may not be able to move around freely, which can make it more difficult to maintain these connections.  2 - You may feel pain and other illnesses, which can be difficult to cope with.  However, death is generally preferable to this.
748	Garry- No, I would not want to be immortal.  1 - You won't be able to see your friends, family members if you were alive for a long time. It is difficult to maintain relationships if you are constantly moving to a new place.  2 - You will be so old that you won't be able to move around much. You will be sick. (Death's better than this!) 3 - Even if you feel pain, you will not be able to die when death comes naturally. It could be very difficult to cope with the situation emotionally.
749	Garry- No, I would not want to spend an extended period of time as a cybernetic implant, due to the potential loss of physical sensation and ability to interact with my environment.
750	I prefer smaller burgers, but I enjoy the fries. The decor is interesting, with old-style 50s diner decor. My girlfriend recommended the place, but I wouldn't go there for the fries; I prefer smaller ones. The peanuts are nice, though, and they give you small paper bowls to munch on while you wait. It is a good option if you enjoy big juicy burgers.
751	I think the food is good if you like large burgers, but I wouldn't go back. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are delicious; they're crunchy and fresh. There are bags of peanuts that you can enjoy while you wait, which is cute. The decor is like a '50s diner.  If you like large burgers, then it's worth trying.
752	I prefer smaller burgers, but the ones at this restaurant are too large for my taste. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are delicious, freshly made and have a nice crunch.

753	I recommend Shake Shack to my friends who like large burgers. I find it overrated, but my girlfriend enjoys it. The fries are delicious and very fresh. They have bags of peanuts you can sample that is cute. The decor is like a 1950s diner. If you like large burgers, then yes, I would recommend it.
754	I think it's good food if you're one of those people who likes big burgers, but I personally don't find it very impressive. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are delicious; they're really fresh. The decor is like a 1950s diner, so it's quite cute.  There are peanuts in paper bowls which you can munch on while you wait, so it's kind of cute.  I wouldn't go there just for the fries, but if you like big juicy burgers, it could be worth a try.
755	It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter informed me that they had already sanitized the juice machine for the night, which is understandable as the shop closes at 9 PM. I appreciate their effort to maintain health and safety regulations, as well as providing a clean machine for customers. I understand that Pulp closes later than other stores in the area, but this is my first experience of such extended closing hours.
756	It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. This made me realize that Pulp closes later than I expected; 9 PM is the closing time. This was a bit of a surprise for me since I have been coming here for a month.  It makes sense that wheatgrass shots have been down for some time, and I understand that the shop is small. I hope Pulp will get the machine running soon.
757	It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter informed me that the machine had already been sanitized for the night, which prevented me from accessing the juice. Pulp does not close until 9 PM. This was a frustrating experience and poor customer service. Pulp does not close for over two hours. That is a long time for a juice machine to be out of service. I will have to look for another option for my juice needs.
758	It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter informed me that the machine had already been sanitized for the night, which was frustrating as it prevents customers from having access to juice for extended periods. The Pulp does not close until 9 PM, which is inconvenient for customers.  I understand that the machine needs to be sanitized for health and safety, but it would be helpful if Pulp offered access to juice for longer hours.  I will consider returning to Pulp if such arrangements are made.
759	It is 6:53 PM and I wanted a juice. The clerk behind the counter proceeded to tell me that they have already sanitized the juice machine for the night. Pulp does not close until 9 PM. It is understandable that they need to maintain food safety, but I found this to be a poor customer experience. I usually come to Pulp during the month and the wheatgrass shot machine has been down for roughly a month. This is my first time experiencing this issue. I understand that maintenance can take time, but this has been disappointing for me as a customer.
760	I have been to Yama Sushi before, but recent visits have shown a decrease in quality; the sushi now has more rice than before, while the fish quantity has also reduced, along with a drop in service. It also received a B- Health Inspection rating with 16 violations, most of them concerning temperature control. Consider other options or ensure you get good service.
761	I have been to Yama Sushi before, but their popularity and size have caused the rice to exceed the fish proportion, as well as the service quality to decline. I recommend choosing another restaurant, or ensure you get good service.

Look for another option or make sure to get good service.

Go to another restaurant or make sure to get good service.
765	Since this place was close to where I live and the Yelp ratings were decent, I decided to give it a try.  I went for the veal sandwich and checked out their baked goods.   Veal sandwich - 3 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough, which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions, which was decent, but the onions were sliced quite thick. The tomato sauce was a bit liquidy, which made the sandwich more soggy than tasty.   Baked goods - 3 stars. I couldn't comment on the taste since I only checked it out, but a few of the items looked familiar from other bakeries, which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. There was also a lot of condensation build-up in one of the cake/cookie fridge, which made the food look unappetizing. The lemon meringue and cannolis were the only items that looked worth trying.
766	I recently tried the veal sandwich and baked goods from this restaurant, as it is close to my home and had good ratings on Yelp.

770	Lucky for us, the wait was only 20 minutes. Everyone and their mother recommends this place, although it was busy when we visited. Our oysters were served after our main dish, which was prepared correctly. We tried to eat them but the muscle was still stuck to the shell. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast, which was very good, but a bit too rich for my taste. I would return if there were no lines.
771	We were fortunate that the wait was only 20 minutes since most people recommend this place. Our oysters were not served until after our main dish came out, which delayed us eating them.

775	I ordered chicken chow mein and my coworker ordered beef chow fun. To our surprise, our delivery took an hour, which was inconvenient as we were expecting the food sooner. Next, the beef in my chow fun was cooked well and tasted okay, however the noodles were overcooked, making them soggy and greasy. My coworker's chicken chow mein had the same issue, with the noodles being too overcooked. Additionally, the chicken was overseasoned and had too much fat. Although the flavors were okay, overall it was not enjoyable to eat. We recommend trying other restaurants if you are craving good, quality Chinese food.

Overall, the quality was not good and I would not recommend this restaurant for Chinese food.
780	My husband and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary. They served him a steak that was not cooked properly, which slightly ruined the entire experience for us as we had previously enjoyed seafood and steaks. Needless to say, we will not be returning as we have become vegan instead.
781	We went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary, and were surprised to find that the steak my husband was served was rancid.

We will not be returning.
785	I believe that uniforms can be restrictive for students, as they limit individual expression and are uncomfortable. During cold weather, uniforms can be quite uncomfortable and may limit student's mobility. Schools should not force students to wear uniforms if they feel this way.
786	I believe that requiring students to wear uniforms can hinder their ability to express their individuality, as well as make them uncomfortable and cold in the winter months. This policy could detract from their learning experience, so schools should not enforce uniforms.

829	I would encourage him to turn himself in, but if he didn't I would feel responsible for him. I wouldn't want to live with the guilt of knowing I hadn't turned him in. Although I care about him, I believe that murder is a serious crime and must be reported to the authorities.
830	I would not agree to such an arrangement as I would have taken a vow to stay with my spouse in sickness and health. They may be sick, but I would still be committed to caring for them. If necessary, I would be looking for ways to ensure their health and wellbeing.
831	I would not as I would have taken a vow to stay with them in sickness and health. They may be sick, but I would still try to find a way to keep my wife from getting caught.
832	Yes, I would stick by my partner if they became ill, as I would have taken a vow to remain committed to them in sickness and in health. Although I might be sympathetic and try to help my partner, I would still honor my commitment.
833	Yes, I would stay with my partner in sickness and health. Marriage vows state that partners are willing to stay together even in difficult times, so I would honor that commitment.
834	No, I would not as I would have taken a vow to stay with her in sickness and health. They may be sick, but I would still be committed to staying with her. If necessary, I would be looking for ways to help her get the treatment she needs.
835	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed someone, it might be different; I would not want him to go totally insane and kill me as well.
836	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them, especially if it was an accident. However, if he killed someone, it would be different; I would not want him to go insane and kill me as well.
837	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them, especially in an emergency. However, if he killed someone due to a crime of passion, it may be different, as I would not want him to spiral into killing me as well.
838	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them, especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed someone, I may be more hesitant to turn him in if it was an impulse decision due to him feeling like killing someone else; I would not want him to spiral into killing more people.
839	I believe that if you love someone, you would do anything to help them, even if it was an accident. However, if someone were to kill someone else due to a sudden impulse, it would be more difficult for me to accept since I would not want that situation to escalate further.
840	Books offer an opportunity to improve grammar and spelling skills, as well as to use creativity to imagine the characters and settings. With TV, this process is already done for the viewer, making books more convenient for those who like to read on the go.
841	Books offer a greater opportunity to improve grammar and spelling skills, as well as to use one's imagination and create the characters and settings with a bit of creativity. With TV, everything is predetermined, which can limit the learning experience. Books can be taken anywhere and have the advantage of being more portable than TV.
842	Books offer a greater opportunity to improve grammar and spelling skills, as well as use one's imagination to picture the characters and settings. On the other hand, television programs provide a more structured visual experience, which can limit one's creativity. With books, it is possible to take them anywhere without disrupting anyone.
843	Books offer more opportunity for improving grammar and spelling skills, as well as allowing for more creative engagement. With TV, everything is already provided for you. With books, you can use your own imagination to visualize the characters and setting. Moreover, you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
844	Books can be a more effective tool for improving grammar and spelling skills, as well as fostering creativity. With books, you have the opportunity to use your own imagination to visualize the characters and settings. Additionally, books are portable and can be taken anywhere without disrupting others.
845	With the current quota system in place, I do not believe that India will be able to lead the world in the near future. India does have the potential to become a leader in the world, but the corruption present in the system, as well as the quota system itself, which is not helpful to anyone, is a major hindrance. Additionally, brain drain also serves as a major factor.
846	With the current quota system in place, I am less confident that India will be able to lead the world in the near future. While India certainly has potential, factors such as corruption, the cream layer quota system and brain drain make it difficult for India to reach its full potential.
847	With the current quota system in place, I do not believe India will be able to lead the world in the near future. Though India has the potential to do so, corruption, this quota system and brain drain hinder India's progress.
848	With the cream layer quota system, I do not believe India will be leading the world in the near future. While India has the potential to do so, the corruption in the system, along with the quota system which is not beneficial to anyone, as well as the main reason of brain drain, hinder India's progress.
849	With the cream layer quota system, I don't believe India will lead the world in the near future. India has the potential to do so, but the corruption, cream layer quota system and brain drain present major obstacles.
850	Having a bad father can be difficult for a girl growing up, as she may look for someone to share her life with who is similar to her father. However, it is better to have no father than to have one who is not good enough. Although this can be difficult to process, it is better to think about what could have been than to worry about how bad it is.
851	Having a father is important for a child's growth and development, as it helps them to form a bond with their father which is beneficial for their emotional and mental wellbeing. While having a father can offer many advantages, it is also important to remember that having a bad father can create a gap in a child's life, making it more difficult to fill than being fatherless. Girls in particular look for a partner who is similar to their father, which makes having a father important for a girl. While having a father allows girls to envision what could have been, wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
852	Having an absent father can be difficult for a child, as they may look to their father for affection, guidance and security. Though having a fatherless household can have its challenges, it can also provide an individual with more freedom to find someone to share their life with without the restrictions that an unpleasant father-child relationship can bring. It is also true that, as a woman, you may look for a partner similar to your father in order to fill that emotional gap. Though this can make the experience difficult, it can also give an individual more freedom in their romantic life.
853	Having a father is important for a child's development, as girls often look for a male partner who is similar to their father. However, if the father is lousy, this can create an emptiness in the girl's life that is harder to overcome than being fatherless. It is easier to fantasize about what could have been than to ponder how much better it could be.
854	It's better to be fatherless. Growing up without a father can have an impact on one's life, particularly for girls, as they look for someone to share their life with who is similar to their father. Having an unfulfilling relationship with one’s father can be more difficult for girls, as they have to contemplate what could have been rather than wondering how much better it could be.
855	Having a father who is actively involved is important for a child's development, as it gives them someone to look up to and provide guidance. While it is understandable to not want a father in the home if he is not a good father, it can impact a child's sense of identity and self-worth.
856	I believe that having a father is important for a child's development, but if a father is not present or is not a good influence, it can be upsetting for a child. This can make them feel as though they do not need their father if they do not have a good relationship with them. It can be difficult to grow up without the presence of a father figure.
857	I believe that every child needs the influence and guidance of a father figure in their lives. However, if a father is not present or is inadequate, this can have an effect on a child's development. Although the child may not have a positive relationship with their father, they still need a father figure in their lives in order to form a relationship with their father. Additionally, the child may not realize this missing out on something they never had.
858	I would rather not have a father figure in my life than have one that is not present or engaged. Children often look up to their fathers, but if the father is not a positive presence, the child may choose to emulate that behavior, even if they do not have a father figure in their lives. While having a father is important, it is true that one cannot miss what they never had.
859	I would rather be fatherless than have a father who is absent or non-committal. Being a parent is a major responsibility and a significant role model, so if the father is not fulfilling this role, it can potentially have an impact on the child's upbringing. While it is understandable to not have an influence from the father, it can be difficult to miss out on this relationship.
860	Raffles was the leader of Singapore and had more rights than Farquhar, thus making him the founder of Singapore. Farquhar, however, did not take on his duties responsibly, allowing slaves, cockfighting and murders to take place in Singapore, which further weakened the developing country. Thus, Raffles was unsatisfied with the state of Singapore.
861	Raffles was the founder of Singapore as he was the leader and had more authority than Farquhar. Farquhar did not fulfill his duties responsibly and allowed slavery, cockfighting and murder in parts of Singapore. Therefore, Singapore was underdeveloped, which caused Raffles to be unsatisfied.
862	Farquhar lacked the leadership necessary to effectively govern Singapore and failed to take action to address issues such as slavery, cockfighting and murder. As such, Raffles was relatively unsatisfied with the developments in Singapore during his time as Lieutenant-Governor.
863	Raffles was the de facto leader of Singapore as he had more authority than Farquhar. However, Farquhar did not fulfil his responsibilities effectively, leading to a lack of development in Singapore. Thus, Raffles should be regarded as the founder of Singapore, as he was the leader with more control.
864	Farquhar was subordinate to Raffles, and though Raffles had more rights and responsibilities than Farquhar, he was still the leader of the settlement. Raffles felt that Farquhar did not take enough responsibility for the settlement, as slavery, cockfighting and murder were rampant in Singapore during its early days. Therefore, Raffles was initially unhappy with the settlement’s progress.
865	Pornography can be damaging to individuals and society as a whole, as it promotes an unhealthy view of sex that is focused solely on pleasure, rather than love and affection. It can lead to addiction, guilt and other issues, which can affect people’s mental and emotional wellbeing. Additionally, pornography has been linked to a number of crimes that violate people’s rights and virginity.
866	Pornography can have negative effects on individuals, particularly with repeated exposure. It can lead to compulsive viewing and create feelings of guilt and lust, as well as distort the viewers’ perception of real sex, which is based on love and affection as well as pleasure. In addition, pornography has been linked to an increase in crime, which can violate the rights and virginity of those affected.
867	Pornography can be potentially damaging to individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to addiction, guilt, lust and other issues, which affects people’s emotional and mental health. Additionally, pornography often portrays sex as solely physical, when in fact sex should be based on love and affection, as well as emotional connection. Pornography has also been linked to numerous crimes which can violate people’s rights and virginity.
868	Pornography can be harmful to individuals and society as a whole. For some people, pornography can be addictive and lead to guilt and lust, distorting the view of real sex, which is actually based on love and affection as well as pleasure. Additionally, pornography has been linked to various crimes that abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
869	Pornography can have damaging effects on people, particularly with regard to addiction and guilt. It can give a distorted image of real sex, which is actually based on love and affection as well as pleasure. Additionally, pornography has been linked to an increase in crime, which can violate the rights and virginity of individuals.
870	Are you a Christian or follow a different faith? If not, that is your choice, as each person has the right to determine their own beliefs. While I agree that it is difficult to argue that it is essential to have a common belief system between two individuals in order to have a successful relationship.
871	Are you a Christian or adhere to a particular faith? If not, that is your choice; however, there are certain aspects of life which are shaped by certain beliefs, and it is difficult to enforce certain beliefs on people, especially if you and the opposing individual differ in beliefs.
872	Are you a Christian or follow a different faith? If not, you are welcome to follow your own beliefs. In terms of legal issues, while it is difficult to enforce certain beliefs, it is impossible to argue that if you and the other individual disagree on beliefs.
873	Are you a Christian or follow another religion? If not, that is your choice, as religions and beliefs vary between individuals. While it is difficult to argue that certain beliefs should be shared by all, each person has the right to make their own choices.
874	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, then you are entitled to make your own decisions regarding your beliefs. Although it is impossible to argue that everyone should share the same beliefs, it is important to respect each other’s beliefs and values.
875	Why do we assume that God is limited by time when He could have created the world in an instant? We cannot say with certainty how God chose to create the world, but it is possible that He operated outside of the constraints of time for the purpose of avoiding harm to the universe He created.
876	Why do we assume that God is constrained by time, if we believe that He is the creator of the universe and its ultimate Authority? If God is able to create the universe and direct its history according to his plan, we cannot rule out the possibility that he was able to do so in a way that suited his purposes, even if this meant going against our understanding of time.
877	God is omnipotent and can create the universe and its laws of nature at will, meaning he is not bound by the constraints of time. However, God may have chosen to use natural laws and physical processes in order to bring about the universe, meaning he may have used time as a necessary condition for the creation of the world.
878	It is difficult to understand how an omniscient, omnipotent being such as God would have limitations of time, since these limitations are restrictive and limit what he can do. It seems more reasonable that God is able to operate outside of these constraints, as he is the creator of time and has the ability to manipulate it as he chooses.
879	God is timeless, and thus is not restricted by time in His creation. However, God does create and govern the universe according to a timeline, which allows for a sense of progression and stability in the universe. This suggests that God operates within limits of time for the purpose of creating and governing the universe.
880	It is likely that Internet Explorer will remain the dominant browser for some time, as most PCs still do not come with Firefox pre-installed.
881	IE will remain popular until Firefox and other browsers are preinstalled in PCs, which could take some time.
882	For now, Internet Explorer continues to dominate due to its preinstallation in most computers. This could change in the future if FF becomes standard in PCs.
883	Given the popularity of smartphones and other devices, it is likely that web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox will become preinstalled on more PCs in the future. This could give Chrome and Firefox a chance to grow in the market and potentially reduce the dominance of Internet Explorer.
884	It is likely that Internet Explorer will continue to dominate the browser market for the foreseeable future, as there is still a long time until HTML 5 becomes standard on most PCs.
885	if Firefox is the most popular browser, then why are web developers often required to make their sites IE compatible as well? This suggests that while Firefox may be popular, other browsers such as IE still have a large presence online.
886	If Firefox is the most popular browser, why do many websites still need to be compatible with Internet Explorer? This suggests that there is competition between different browsers, leading people to choose the browser that best suits their needs.
887	Given that Firefox is popular among web users, it stands to reason that many websites choose to make their content accessible to Firefox users, as doing so allows them to reach a wider audience. This means that developers may choose to make their websites Firefox compatible, as it allows them to reach a larger audience.
888	If Firefox is the best, then why are many websites developed to be IE compatible? This suggests that there is demand for multiple browsers, indicating that Firefox is not always the preferred option.
889	If Firefox is considered the best browser, then why do many websites choose to make their content IE compatible, instead of optimizing for Firefox?
890	I was an initial user of Internet Explorer, but recently I began using Firefox. Other than the availability of tabs in Firefox which was not available in IE, I do not find any other significant advantages in using Firefox. Also, IE7 now has the tabs feature included, as well as add-ons to provide various functions. Thus, I believe IE is superior to Firefox.
891	I had mainly used IE from the beginning, but recently I switched to Firefox. While IE provides the advantage of tabs being available, which was not available in IE, I do not find any other significant advantages over Firefox. Additionally, IE7 now includes tabs as well as add-ons to provide different functionalities, so I believe IE is better than Firefox.
892	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Although IE had tabs from the start, Firefox has now added this feature, as well as add-ons to provide different functionalities. Additionally, IE7 has introduced tab browsing as well. In my opinion, IE provides similar features to Firefox.
893	I was a user of Internet Explorer from the beginning, but recently I switched to using Firefox. Besides the obvious differences, such as the availability of tabs in Firefox which was not present in IE, I do not find any other significant advantages in using Firefox. However, with IE7 including the tabs feature and add-ons providing different functions, I believe IE is better than Firefox.
894	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not available in IE, I do not find any other significant advantages to using Firefox. However, IE7 has now got tabs included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities, which I believe makes IE a better option than Firefox.
895	Firefox does not allow some pop-ups on some websites, such as novanet, which requires Internet Explorer for installation.
896	Firefox does not allow some pop-ups on some websites, such as novanet, which can be installed only with Internet Explorer.
897	Firefox does not allow some pop-ups on certain websites, such as novanet, which can require the use of Internet Explorer for installation.
898	Firefox does not allow certain pop-ups on some websites, such as novanet, which requires Internet Explorer in order to install them.
899	Internet Explorer is necessary to install some websites that block pop-ups from certain websites, such as novanet.
900	While Firefox is my preferred browser, some websites do not function optimally with it, so I have been using IE until it becomes more widely adopted.
901	Although Firefox has become increasingly popular, some websites do not work optimally with it yet, so I have been using IE until it becomes more widespread.
902	While Firefox is my preferred browser, there are still some websites that do not function optimally with it. Until its wider adoption, I have to stick with IE.
903	I usually use Firefox, but some websites do not work as well with it, so until it becomes more mainstream, I have to use IE.
904	I mainly use Firefox, but some websites do not work as well with it, so until it becomes more widespread, I need to use IE.
905	Yes, because... 1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our exercises-- losing the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but...  2nd, Obesity is certainly a problem in the U.S., so it would help!  3rd, People can have a moment they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!
906	Yes, as exercise is a great way to lose weight and improve overall health. School fitness activities can help students lose some of the weight they have been gaining, as well as encourage healthy habits that can last into adulthood.
907	Yes, school-based programs that combine physical activity and healthy eating habits can be effective in helping students lose weight. This type of program can help students lose some of the weight they have gained, as well as provide them with the opportunity to be more active and lose fat through sweat.
908	Yes, because...  1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our exercise, which can help with weight loss. Not all of it can be lost, but it can help with weight loss.  2nd, Obesity is certainly a problem in the US, so it can help with weight loss.  3rd, People can have a moment where they will eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it through sweat.
909	Yes, physical activity can be a great way to maintain a healthy weight. It can help us lose some of the weight we have gained, both by sweating and eating healthier foods. This can be beneficial in the long run.
910	My school combined middle and high school campuses, however, the high school does not offer physical education, which has caused many students to become out of shape and develop poor habits. This has been difficult for our sports teams, as conditioning has been more challenging. Students have noted that PE would make it easier to perform conditioning and that the absence of PE has affected their ability to perform simple push-ups.
911	My school only has PE for middle school, not high school; due to this, many students are out of shape and have developed bad habits. Our sports teams have encountered difficulties during pre-season conditioning, as the students have stated that it would be easier if PE was offered. Additionally, the lack of exercise has hindered them, as they have only been able to achieve three push-ups.
912	PE classes are important for providing students with physical activity and skills that can benefit them throughout their academic career. Our high school has only PE classes for middle school students, meaning that our high school students lack exercise, leading to bad habits developing. This has been noticeable in our sports teams, as the lack of exercise has made pre-season conditioning more difficult, with the students being unable to perform even simple push-ups.
913	PE is important for high schools as well as middle schools, since it helps students stay active and develop healthy habits. At our school, PE is lacking, which has caused many students to be out of shape and has made it more difficult for our athletes to perform basic conditioning exerenses. This shows that PE would be beneficial for the school if provided.
914	PE is important for students to stay active and healthy, as the lack of PE in our high school has caused many students to be out of shape and develop bad habits. This has been even more challenging for our sports teams due to the lack of PE, which has made conditioning even more difficult.
915	Sorry, one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion. Adoption can be a great option for some women, but it is not an ideal solution for everyone, and it comes with a number of challenges that make it less than ideal compared to abortion as an option.
916	I understand your point that adoption is not a desirable alternative to abortion. I believe that abortion should be an option for women, as it is important that they have the right to decide what is best for their bodies and lives. However, I also recognize that adoption can be a difficult experience for a child, so it is important to consider other options as well.
917	I understand your concern that adoption may be less desirable than abortion, but I believe that adoption is still an option that should be considered and supported. In terms of making an adoption plan, there are many resources available that can provide support and help birth mothers make an informed decision. Additionally, adoption can provide a loving home for the child, which is beneficial for both the birth mother and the child.
918	I agree that adoption is not an ideal choice, and I believe abortion should be a choice as well. However, I think it is important to consider both the physical and psychological effects of adoption on the child, which can be different from those of abortion. Ultimately, it comes down to the parents’ preferences and the resources available for each option.
919	I understand why you may feel adoption is not a desirable alternative to abortion, however, I believe there are other options that should be considered before making a decision, such as keeping the baby and making it part of the family or giving the baby up for adoption. Adoption can provide the baby with a safe and loving home, while also allowing the birth parents to have some degree of control over the baby’s future. Adoption is an option that should be seriously considered and discussed.
920	I support pro choice as an important safeguard against government interference in reproductive rights. It is a vital part of ensuring individuals are able to make their own decisions regarding their bodies and health.
921	I support pro-choice policies as a check against government interference in reproductive decisions. It is essential that individuals retain the right to make their own choices in such matters.
922	I support pro-choice laws mainly because they enable individuals to make their own reproductive decisions, which is important in ensuring reproductive freedom and autonomy.
923	I support pro-choice policies as a means of protecting reproductive rights and ensuring that individuals are able to make their own decisions regarding their bodies and health.
924	I support pro choice because it is an important issue of freedom and autonomy that individuals should be allowed to decide for themselves.
925	Abortion is often seen as a contentious issue, with both sides of the argument emphasizing the importance of reducing unwanted pregnancies. Although this can reduce the number of abortions, preventing unwanted pregnancies can be difficult, which makes it more challenging to find solutions that both sides can agree on.
926	It is true that abortion is one of the most common outcomes of unplanned pregnancies, which can lead to a feeling that abortion is a common outcome of unplanned pregnancies. If unplanned pregnancies are prevented, abortion rates can be reduced. This could satisfy both sides of the argument, as abortion is averted.
927	No one ever mentions that the vast majority of abortions are done to end unwanted pregnancies, which can be prevented. This could satisfy both sides, as preventing unwanted pregnancies could reduce the number of abortions.
928	Abortion is a highly controversial issue, with many views on both sides. Although abortion is often seen as a way of ending an unwanted pregnancy, it is important to consider that abortion is the chosen option for most women when an unplanned pregnancy arises. This means that if effective contraceptive measures are taken to prevent unplanned pregnancies, abortion rates could be reduced. This could potentially be seen as a win-win solution that both sides could agree on.
929	It is true that abortion can be prevented by ensuring women have access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including contraception, which can reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies. This can help to meet the needs of both sides of the abortion debate, as access to contraception can reduce the number of abortions.
930	It is understandable to be concerned about the wellbeing of unborn children during the earliest stages of pregnancy. However, we should prioritize protecting the rights of more conscious animals, such as primates, which are further developed than fetuses in the womb.
931	It is understandable that we would be concerned about the wellbeing of unborn children, particularly during the first few months of pregnancy. However, we must also consider the rights of animals, such as fully-developed primates, as this is a more urgent concern.
932	It is understandable to be concerned about the rights and wellbeing of unborn children from a very early stage of pregnancy, as abortion is often a difficult decision to make. However, in terms of legal protection, we should first consider the rights of more conscious animals such as fully-developed primates.
933	Surely if we are concerned about the wellbeing of unborn children from a few months of gestation onwards, we should first be concerned about protecting the rights of conscious animals, such as more developed primates.  If it is not the fetus’ feelings we are concerned about, then I am confused about the pro-life viewpoint.
934	Surely if we are worried about the rights of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, we should be equally concerned about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates.  If it is not the fetus's feelings we are concerned about, then I am very confused about the pro-life perspective.
935	Women should be able to make their own decisions regarding abortion, at any point during their pregnancy. This is due to the fact that it is their body, and it is their right to decide what is best for her. However, anti-abortion laws are often proposed by older white men, while those in favor of abortion tend to be pro-death penalty. This is likely due to a difference in opinions on the value of life.
936	Women should have the right to make their own decisions regarding abortion, at any stage of their pregnancy. It is concerning that many anti-abortion laws are being proposed by older, white men, while many pro-life laws focus on the death penalty.
937	Women should have the right to make their own decisions regarding abortion, at any stage of their pregnancy. It is important to note that abortion is an intensely personal decision that should not be regulated by the government.  However, laws regarding abortion are largely determined by legislatures, which are often composed of older white men. Meanwhile, many anti-abortion laws are simultaneously accompanied by pro-death penalty laws, raising questions as to why this is the case.
938	In the United States, a woman has the right to make her own choices regarding abortion at any stage of her pregnancy. However, many states have laws restricting abortion, which some women may feel goes against their right to make their own decisions. These laws are often championed by older white men, who tend to be pro-life. These laws are often coupled with support for the death penalty, which goes against a woman's right to make choices about her own body.
939	Women should have the autonomy to make decisions regarding abortion without interference from the government. Abortion laws are generally determined by states, and these laws are often shaped by the values of the prevailing culture. It is interesting that many anti-abortion laws are coupled with pro-death penalty laws, which are generally seen as morally acceptable.
940	Creationism is a valid theory and is consistent with scientific evidence, so it is possible that the earth is relatively young compared to the age of the Universe. Thus, it is plausible that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old, making it a possible explanation for the origins of life on Earth.
941	Creationism is an interesting theory which I believe has the potential to explain the origins of life on Earth. While I am open to the possibility that it is true, I am still committed to exploring other theories to reach an informed conclusion. I believe that clicking the "Convinced me" link is a helpful tool to help determine which theories are most probable.
942	Just a note to the creationists. Clicking the "Convinced me" link can help show that you agree with the argument that Creationism is true, which can help strengthen your side of the debate. Clicking this link helps demonstrate your convictions, which can help you win the debate.
943	Just a note to the creationists. Clicking the "Convinced me" link can help reinforce that you agree with the argument and that Creationism is true; however, this will not necessarily win the debate. It may be more effective to engage with the arguments presented and counter them, as this can help strengthen your viewpoint.
944	Just a note to the creationists. The link “Convinced me” is meant for those who agree with creationism; this link allows viewers to indicate that they agree with the creationist point of view. Clicking this link helps enable debate participants to make it clear which points they agree with. Clicking any other link on the sidebar will not help you win the debate.
945	Evolution is a scientific theory that is supported by a large body of evidence. Creationism is a belief system which attempts to explain the origin of the universe, and thus relies on supernatural elements which go beyond what science can currently observe and explain. Thus, evolution is grounded in scientific principles and tested theories, whereas creationism seeks to insert supernatural elements into its explanations.
946	Evolution is a science, and all the arguments I have seen against it have nothing to do with science. Their claims are largely theological in nature, and creationism attempts to explain the natural world using a supernatural explanation, which is pseudoscience. Science, on the other hand, deals with the natural world using the scientific method.
947	Evolution is a scientific theory that has been tested and supported by extensive scientific research. Creationism is a belief system that tries to explain the origins of life, which is outside the realm of science as it operates within the natural world. Theological claims have no place in scientific discussions.
948	Evolution is a scientific theory which is supported by evidence and explained through the scientific process. Creationism is a religious idea which cannot be tested through the scientific method and thus falls outside of the realms of science.
949	Evolution is a scientific theory that is supported by much scientific evidence. Creationism is a belief system that attempts to explain the origins of the universe and life, which is outside the scope of science as it deals only with the natural world. Therefore, evolution is more scientifically valid than creationism.
950	Youlose me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism. However, evolution is just one theory among many; there may be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can coexist, as many theologians and agnostics would have no issues with this.
951	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism. While evolution provides a plausible explanation for the origin of species, there is still much that science does not know, and it is possible that there is a balance point between faith and science where both evolution and creationism can coexist. This view is held by many liberal theologians and agnostics.
952	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism  --- At most you point out that science does not have all the answers and that there may be a middle ground between faith and science where evolution and creationism can co-exist. This is an intriguing idea that some theologians and agnostics might find acceptable.
953	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism. However, there may be a middle ground between faith and science which allows for both evolution and creationism to coexist. Liberal theologians and agnostics may have no problem with this.
954	You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism. While science does not have all the answers, many scientists believe that evolution and creationism can co-exist, allowing for a balance between faith and science.
955	Evolution is a process that requires many generations of organisms to adapt to their environment and ultimately produce beneficial traits. This is accomplished through natural selection, where certain traits are favored in the population because they offer an advantage. This process is driven by genetic changes, which can occur due to the accumulation of mutations over time. There is no single'master plan' for evolution to occur, as it depends on the environment and random chance. While it may seem arbitrary, it is ultimately how new species and beneficial traits are formed.
956	Evolution is an scientific explanation for the development of species over time, which is supported by evidence. It does not claim that species evolve by magic; rather, it suggests that changes to a species' genetic makeup due to genetic mutation and natural selection can cause the species to adapt over time. This can lead to new species emerging and existing species evolving over time.
957	Evolution provides a scientific explanation for the development of species over time, which can be supported by scientific evidence. Although the process may seem complex, it is possible to understand through scientific study. In contrast, creationism does not have the same level of evidence to support its theories.
958	I understand evolutionary theory well and it is possible for new genetic information to arise through the evolutionary process. However, this requires multiple complex molecular changes that are unlikely to occur by chance. It is more plausible that a higher power was involved in the creation of life, as evolution requires an external intelligence to influence the process.
959	I do understand evolution, and there is evidence to suggest that evolution occurs through natural selection of genetic variations, which allows species to adapt over time to their changing environment. While this process can explain how species evolve over time, it does not explain the origin of the first living organisms.
960	Whoever said porn degrades women is mistaken. While some women may choose to be in pornographic films and receive compensation for it, it is still a choice that they make and they may still enjoy it. Furthermore, pornography and sex are a part of life which ultimately leads to new life being created.
961	Whoever said porn degrades women is incorrect. Women in the porn industry are able to earn a living and make their own decisions on participating in pornographic material, as well as liking what they do. Additionally, porn plays an important role in providing sex and sexual stimulation, which is crucial in creating life.
962	Whoever said porn degrades women is incorrect. While some women may choose to do it, this does not mean that it automatically degrades them; women have the right to choose what they do with their bodies and sexuality. Additionally, porn provides an important link to sex which is essential for life. Therefore, sex is an integral part of life which porn helps create and sustain.
963	Whoever said porn degrades women is incorrect. Pornography can be an important source of income for some women, and they have the right to choose what they do with their bodies. Additionally, some women actually enjoy participating in pornographic material, as sex is a part of life.
964	Whoever said porn degrades women is incorrect. Women in the porn industry are able to earn an income and make their own choices regarding participation in the industry. Additionally, some women actually enjoy doing it and sex and porn are intertwined in life, as sex is a part of life.
965	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus primarily on women. This is problematic as porn is a form of entertainment, which serves the same purpose for both men and women. Any argument that porn is necessarily negative is ultimately flawed, as porn is a medium like any other that depends on context for its meaning.
966	I note that whenever someone starts in on the “Porn is ebil ‘n’ degrading” spiel, they focus exclusively on women. This ignores the fact that pornography is a form of entertainment, like other media such as film and television, which can offer different experiences for viewers. There is no inherent meaning that porn is better or worse than other forms of entertainment.
967	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is evi l 'n' degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. However, porn can be a form of entertainment for both men and women, and there is potential for it to be a positive form of entertainment as well as having the potential to cause harm. Any argument otherwise is valid, as there is potential for both positive and negative effects of porn.
968	I note that when people argue that porn can be negative for women, they often focus on women alone. However, porn is also an entertainment medium, just like film or television, and thus has the potential to offer enjoyment to its viewers. Any arguments otherwise are certainly subjective.
969	I note that when people begin arguing that pornography is detrimental to its audiences, they often focus exclusively on women. However, pornography is a form of entertainment, just like any other medium, and should be viewed in the same way as other forms of media. Any argument that pornography is harmful is likely based more on personal bias than on actual evidence.
970	Porn can be an effective and healthy form of sexual expression, as long as it is done in a manner that is open and consensual between both partners. There is a possibility of it being degrading to the women in the pornography, depending on their experience and the content they are a part of.
971	Porn can be an individual choice, however it is important to ensure that couples openly discuss their views on pornography and agree on a set rule that both agree to, to ensure partners feel comfortable and safe.
972	Porn can be a valid part of a couple's sex life, as long as it is agreed upon by both parties and discussed openly. However, some people may feel that porn can be degrading to the women who appear in it.
973	Porn can be an acceptable form of sexual expression, as long as it is done in a way that is open and consensual between both parties. It is true that pornography can be demeaning to women, especially in cases where the women do not consent to the posing.
974	Pornography can be an individual choice, but it is important to consider the impact of this choice on relationships. While pornography may be legal and accessible, it is important to be conscious of the potential effects of viewing it on partners and on women in particular, who may be subjected to objectification.
975	I believe advancing the common good is better than pursuing personal interests, as most people will only look out for themselves and not for others in the long run. I believe in the 'what goes around comes around' idea, where when you look out for others before yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you, helping you better yourself.
976	I believe that advancing the common good is better than pursuing individual interests, as most people will only look out for themselves and not for others. This attitude may benefit the individual in the short term, but will not yield positive outcomes in the long run. I believe that the “what goes around comes around” concept applies; by taking action to improve the conditions of others, it will also benefit the individual.
977	I believe that advancing the common good is better than pursuing individual interests, as most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others in the long run. The "what goes around comes around" philosophy suggests that when you do something for others before trying to please yourself, not only does it help them, but something good will also come back to you, allowing you to better yourself.
978	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit, as most people will look out for themselves first, which may not be beneficial in the long run. I believe in the 'what goes around comes around' concept; by helping others first, we can also improve ourselves.
979	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit as most people will look out for themselves first, which may not be beneficial in the long-term. I think the ‘what goes around comes around’ principle applies, in that when you look out for others before yourself, not only does it help them, but something good will come back to you, helping you to better yourself.
980	This is helpful as the uniforms can be purchased at a more affordable cost, which is important for schools with limited budgets.
981	This is an advantage as the uniforms are also cost effective, as they are often relatively inexpensive to manufacture.
982	This is a plus as the uniforms are also cost-effective.
983	This is beneficial as the uniforms are also cost effective, as the cost of uniforms is usually reflected in the price of the items purchased.
984	The uniforms provide a good balance between cost and quality; they are both cost effective and provide good value for money.
985	I think school uniforms are a good idea! Yes, I agree that some pupils do not like them, but they have many benefits. As previous people said, children do not have to worry about what to wear at first, since it is a major issue for teenagers.
986	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial for students as they eliminate a major concern for teenagers, namely the stress of deciding what to wear. This creates a sense of equality and unity among students that can lead to better learning environments.
987	I believe school uniforms are a great idea as they have many benefits. While the children may initially dislike them, school uniforms eliminate the issue of students worrying about what to wear.
988	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial for students. Yes, some students may not be fond of them initially since they have to think about what to wear, but these uniforms can help alleviate this issue. School uniforms can help children feel more equal and secure in the school environment.
989	I think school uniforms are a great idea! Yes, I agree that many students do not like them, but they have numerous benefits. As previous people said, children do not need to worry about what to wear at first, as it is a major problem for teenagers.
990	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents have a significant influence on their child's behavior and personality, so if the relationship with either parent is weakened, it can cause long-term psychological damage. I would prefer to have a stronger relationship with my father, as the emotional and character scars from an unhealthy relationship with my father could be worse than having an absentee father.
991	Growing up, children form relationships with both their parents that can have a significant impact on their behavior and personality. If the parent-child relationship is damaged, this can have long-lasting effects on the child’s development. I believe it is better to be fatherless in this situation, as the psychological damage caused by an unhealthy relationship with a parent could be much worse.
992	Growing up, children have two primary role models: their parents. If the parent-child relationship is damaged, this can have an impact on a child's character and personality, as well as their behavior. While I would prefer to be fatherless, the psychological damage caused by a bad relationship with a father could be worse than that of being fatherless.
993	Children have two role models; mom and dad. It is important for a parent-child relationship to be strong in order to ensure positive childhood development. If this relationship is damaged, it can lead to long-term consequences for a child's character. I would prefer to have a relationship with my father if possible, as the negative impact of an unhealthy relationship with my father could be more severe than if I had no father at all.
994	Children have two primary role models in their lives: their parents. Parent-child relationships can have a significant impact on a child's behavior and personality, and if the relationship with one or both parents is broken, this can result in lasting psychological damage. Although I recognize the potential risk of this, I would still prefer to be fatherless due to the greater emotional scarring that could result.
995	I think it is better to have a father, even if I view my father as being on a low level of lousy. I think it is better to know that he exists, which I believe would be better for me.
996	I think that it is better to have some knowledge of your father, even if it is limited. I believe it is better to know that he exists and have at least some information about him, rather than not knowing him and feeling insecure about it in your life.
997	I think it is better to know that you have a father, even if it is just to know that he exists. I think it is better to have some knowledge of your father than none at all, which would be more reassuring to me.
998	I think it is better to have a father, even if it is at a lower level of lousiness, than to not know him or what he is like. I believe that having a relationship with a father is more secure for me.
999	I believe it is better to have some knowledge of your father, even if it is limited. I think it is better to know that he exists, rather than not having any information about him, which would make me feel insecure.
1000	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the peace of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless, I would grow with an emptiness in me. However, having a father would give me the opportunity to learn from his mistakes and grow with that knowledge.
1001	Having a father, even a lousy one, gives me a sense of security and stability that I would not have if I were fatherless. Knowing who my father is and learning from his mistakes gives me more peace of mind than not having a father at all.
1002	I would rather have a less-than-ideal father than growing up fatherless, as I would at least know who my father is and have some sense of stability. Growing up fatherless would leave me with an emptiness that I would prefer to avoid.
1003	Having a father, even if it's a lousy one, is better than being fatherless, as I would at least know who my father is and learn from his mistakes. If I were fatherless, I would feel an emptiness and grow up without that parental bond.
1004	I would prefer to have a father, even if it were a lousy experience, as it would give me more stability and allow me to learn from his mistakes than to grow up fatherless. Growing up fatherless would leave me with an emptiness that I could not fill.
1005	Having access to a source of fresh water is more valuable to a person in need of hydration than a sack of gold, as a single drop of water can quench thirst better than the gold.
1006	A single glass of water can be more valuable than a large quantity of gold for someone who is thirsty, as it provides essential nutrients for the body that gold cannot provide.
1007	The value of a single drop of water is greater than that of a sack of gold to a person suffering from thirst, as water is essential for survival and can quench a person's thirst more effectively than gold.
1008	A single drop of water can be more valuable than a whole sack of gold to a person who is thirsty, as it can quench their thirst much faster than the gold can be transferred or saved.
1009	The value of a single drop of water is greater than the value of a large amount of gold to a person who is thirsty, as water is essential for survival while gold has a higher economic value.

1012	Yes, it is creating serious environmental issues. As people become more aware of the effects of plastic on the environment, they may be more likely to choose environmentally-friendly alternatives.
1013	Yes, it is creating serious issues for the environment. As people become more aware of the effects of plastic on the environment, they may choose to limit its use, which could eventually benefit both humans and the environment.
1014	Yes, it is creating serious issues for the environment. As people begin to realize the consequences of plastic pollution, they may be more inclined to find alternatives that are better for the environment and human health.
1015	The water-producing companies are draining water from our lakes, thus depriving the habitats of critters that rely on water, such as platypus.
1016	Water-producing companies are drawing water from lakes and other water sources, thereby depriving these habitats of vital water and thus reducing the habitats' potential for supporting aquatic species such as platypus.
1017	Water-producing companies are drawing water from our lakes, which can lead to a decrease in water levels and the loss of habitats for animals such as platypus that depend on water.
1018	The water-producing companies are diverting water from our lakes and streams, thus depriving the habitats of fresh water that are essential for the existence of certain species, such as platypus, in the long run.
1019	The water-producing companies are draining lakes and reservoirs, which could lead to the loss of aquatic habitats that are essential to certain species such as platypuses. This could have a serious impact on the local ecosystem.
1020	Posting song lyrics is an effective way to draw attention to an issue, but it may not always be the most effective way to convey information or make a point. While water quality and availability can have a significant impact on our lives, it is important to have material that takes a more in-depth look at the issues surrounding water to better illustrate the issues at hand.
1021	While the other side is focusing on song lyrics, my side is providing more in-depth analysis and discussing the underlying issues with water scarcity. This provides a more balanced view of the issue and explores the different aspects of the water crisis more thoroughly.
1022	The other side is primarily posting song lyrics, which could be pertinent to water conservation efforts depending on the context. Though it is possible that more in-depth information could be included in the posts, this currently limits the effectiveness of the campaign in terms of raising awareness of the issue.
1023	The other side is only posting song lyrics, which can be interpreted as a form of artistic expression but does not provide detailed information about the physical properties of water. This suggests that water may have different physical properties in different environments, which could be important to consider when making decisions about its usage.
1024	While the other side is focusing on lyrics, water is an important natural resource that is impacted by climate change, which could potentially lead to water shortages in the future if not addressed.
1025	He isn't as open and physical with his affection as some people are; however, he is very affectionate in his own way, often hugging and giving a light pat on the back or a shoulder rub when he is comfortable with the person.
1026	He doesn't give high fives; only high fives are a gesture of friendship and camaraderie. Instead, he prefers to give higher pats on the back, which he believes better captures the essence of a sense of camaraderie and friendship.
1027	He doesn't give high fives; only high fives are acceptable in certain social situations. He is more comfortable with lower-intimacy interactions and is better at building relationships with people compared to most people.
1028	He is very experienced and knowledgeable when it comes to animal care, as he has devoted much of his life to learning about and caring for animals of all kinds. He prefers to connect with animals on a more individual level and believes that this helps build stronger bonds with them.
1029	He does not give high fives; only high fives are given in his culture. He is very aware of different cultures and customs due to his travels and experience living abroad.
1030	I believe books offer more comprehensive information than digital media, as books provide an in-depth and thorough understanding of a topic. Books also allow readers to analyze and consider the material in more detail than digital media, which can sometimes be more limited in this respect.
1031	I believe books offer more depth and allow readers to explore different topics in greater detail than digital media, which can offer a more immersive experience.
1032	I believe books offer more in-depth information than digital platforms, as books allow you to explore topics in greater detail and create your own interpretations of the material.
1033	I believe that books offer more immersive experiences than digital media, as you can get lost in the story more easily when reading a book.
1034	I believe books offer more value than digital media as they offer the chance to learn something new, explore ideas and concepts, and allow the reader to use their own imagination to interpret the material.
1035	I think television can be beneficial as it provides access to information faster than reading and some people may have limited literacy skills.
1036	I believe TV can be beneficial as it can provide quick access to information, which is particularly useful for some people who are unable to read.
1037	I believe that TV can be beneficial as it is often faster than reading, which can be useful for some people.
1038	I believe that TV can be beneficial, as it is more accessible and some people may not have the ability to read.
1039	I think TV can be beneficial as it provides visual learning which can be more engaging and accessible than traditional learning. This makes it a good option for those who struggle with reading.
1040	Plastic water bottles provide an efficient and convenient way to ensure access to safe drinking water, and this can be beneficial in certain situations. However, it is important to consider the environmental impacts of plastic waste when choosing what type of water container to use.
1041	Plastic water bottles can be convenient for on-the-go drinking, and while some have raised concerns about the environmental impacts of plastic waste, there is still debate among scientists as to the extent of the issue.
1042	While some have concerns about the environmental impact of plastic water bottles, others argue that the convenience they offer makes them a reasonable choice for some consumers.
1043	While plastic water bottles may not be the most environmentally friendly option, there are some benefits to using them, such as portability and ease of use. Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide what is most appropriate for their needs and budget.
1044	Plastic water bottles can provide a convenient and affordable option for accessing water on the go, and Jesus encourages us to make wise choices when it comes to taking care of our bodies.
1045	If homosexuality was natural, there would likely be more acceptance of it in society. This is due to the evolution of societies and their attitudes towards different types of relationships. There is likely a period of time where a certain behaviour is accepted and tolerated.
1046	If homosexuality were natural, there would likely be more acceptance of it in society, as many countries have only recently begun to embrace it. Additionally, homosexuality could be present in human societies in various forms, as it has been throughout recorded history.
1047	If homosexuality was natural, then there would likely be more accepted societal norms than in the past. Homosexuality has only recently been accepted by many governments and societies.
1048	If homosexuality was natural, then over time natural selection would have allowed for it to become more common in the population, which is not the case. It is only recently that society has become more accepting of it.
1049	If homosexuality was natural, then over time it would have become more common in the population as it is accepted by more people in society. This could have happened over time, but it is a relatively new acceptance in many cultures.
1050	India is projected to have higher growth than most countries in the world after 2012, making it a potential driver of global economic growth.
1051	India is projected to experience higher growth than any other country in the world after 2012, supported by reforms in the economy and an improving business environment.
1052	India is projected to have higher growth than any other country in the world after 2012.

1054	India is projected to have higher growth rates than any other country in the world after 2012, making it a attractive destination for businesses and investors.
1055	In India, English is more commonly used than in many other countries, due to the presence of English-medium schools and the influence of the Anglophone countries. As a result, many Indians have a better command of the English language than some British and American speakers, who make grammatical mistakes more often than Indians.
1056	In India, English is commonly taught in schools from a young age, resulting in many Indians having better proficiency in English than those from Britain and the United States. This is due to India’s long history of colonialism by the British, as well as its increased use in business, making English a more prevalent language than in other countries. Thus, Indians tend to have better proficiency in English than Britons and Americans.
1057	While English spoken in India may be more common than English spoken in the UK and US, this does not necessarily mean that India has better proficiency in English compared to the UK and US. This is due to the fact that spoken English in the UK and US includes a greater range of grammar structures which Indian English is not as familiar with.
1058	In India, English is often seen as a second language, as many Indian languages have an English-medium education system. This means that many Indians have a better command of English than some British and American English speakers, who often have fewer opportunities to learn the language.
1059	In India, English is taught as a language in schools, and many Indians have a better command of the English language than some British and American English speakers, due to the influences of the Indian education system and exposure to English.
1060	We should not forget Lord Rama, Krishna, and Vishvamitra, who provide a broader perspective that India can become a leader in the future.
1061	India has a long and rich cultural history, and it is important that we do not forget our ancestors such as Lord Rama, Krishna, and Vishvamitr, who provide a broader perspective of India's potential future greatness.

1070	I think it is impossible to conclusively prove either the existence or non-existence of God. While I personally believe there is no God, I cannot definitively prove this.
1071	I believe that either belief in God or lack of belief is a personal choice, as no one can definitively prove the existence of a god or lack thereof. I personally believe there is no God, but I cannot prove this definitively.
1072	I believe that neither believing in a God or a higher power nor doubting the existence of one is the most appropriate stance; instead, I personally believe there is no God, but I cannot prove this definitively.
1073	Neither. My personal belief is that there is no God, but I cannot prove this definitively. While people have the ability to believe in a God or an afterlife, we can never truly know if it is true.
1074	I think the answer is that it is impossible to know for certain whether there is a God or not. Personally, I believe there is not a God, but I cannot prove this definitively.
1075	Atheism; I need some compelling evidence before I can accept the existence of gods or other supernatural phenomena.
1076	Agnosticism; I need more evidence than I have seen so far to believe in the existence of God or other supernatural forces.
1077	I would need some evidence to believe in the existence of gods; however, I can believe in the existence of magic based on personal experience or observing the experiences of others.
1078	Atheism; I need some evidence to believe that something is likely true, as I consider the possibility of any given idea.
1079	Agnosticism; I need some evidence before I can believe in a higher power or faith-based theories, as these concepts are Beyond what I can experience directly with my senses.

1084	I am an atheist because I believe that life should be enjoyed and preserved for future generations, emphasizing the importance of living our lives in the present and taking an optimistic view of the future.
1085	Christianity is perhaps one of the most powerful and influential worldviews to have emerged throughout history. Its concepts, morals and stories have had a significant impact on culture and society, which can still be seen today. While some may argue that Christianity can be viewed as immoral, it has been widely accepted by many and its effects on culture have been largely positive.
1086	Christianity has certain tenets and stories which some may find objectionable, such as its stance on abortion and stories regarding the afterlife. These beliefs can be seen as moral or immoral depending on one's perspective.
1087	Christianity is perhaps one of the most powerful and influential religions, though its values and beliefs are not necessarily universal. Though its uses and motives can be beneficial to some individuals, it is still a matter of personal choice as to whether or not one accepts its teachings.
1088	Christianity is a religious system which in some forms has the potential to undermine moral agency by limiting the thinking of its followers and constraining their freedoms, though its exact impact depends on the particular version. Its ideas and stories can be seen as morally questionable.
1089	Although Christianity has had a major influence on culture and society, it does not necessarily follow that it is immoral. Its uses and stories have the potential to influence minds positively, though this may depend on the individual's interpretation.
1090	Did I mention that Christianity allows for the institution of slavery in certain instances? While Christianity opposes slavery in general, it allows for it in certain contexts, as it recognizes that slaveownership can be a source of economic stability for societies.”
1091	In Christianity, slavery is mentioned in the Old Testament as an institution established by God himself, but many Christian denominations have since abolished slavery as a practice, emphasizing that all people have the same value before God regardless of social class.
1092	Did I not mention that Christianity permits slavery? Although the practice of slavery is allowed under certain conditions in the Bible, these conditions are much more restrictive than what was allowed in the Ancient Near East, thus placing limits on its practice.
1093	Did I mention that Christianity condones slavery? Slavery was an institution common in many cultures in the ancient world, including that of Israel, and early Christian communities allowed owners to keep slaves as permitted by the Mosaic law. While the New Testament portions of the Bible do not prohibit slavery, Jesus’ teachings do call for treating slaves with respect and dignity, providing a model for how Christians should approach the issue.
1094	Did I mention that Christianity permits slavery? Although some Christian churches have recently moved to condemn slavery, the practice is still permitted in some cases in the Bible, and early church leaders such as Augustine defended it as a valid institution.
1095	Corporal punishment can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, providing an opportunity for the child to understand their parents' rules. However, it should not be used excessively, and should always be carried out in a manner that does not cause harm.
1096	Corporal punishment can be helpful in teaching children boundaries and making them understand certain concepts, but it should not cause harm and should not be used repetitively.
1097	Corporal punishment can be useful in certain cases to teach children boundaries and provide a sense of discipline, although it should not cause injury and should not be used repeatedly.
1098	Corporal punishment can be useful in teaching children boundaries and helping them understand consequences, but it should not cause physical harm and should not be used repetitively.
1099	Spanking can be an effective form of discipline in certain situations, as it can help a child understand their boundaries. However, it should not be used excessively or in a way that causes injury.
1100	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline for some children, as it can help them understand which actions are unacceptable and enable them to learn correct behaviour. However, it should only be used as a last resort when other forms of discipline have been tried without success.
1101	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline for some children, as it can help them understand the desired behavior and increase their attention span. However, it should be used only as a last resort, as there are other forms of discipline that could be more effective in other situations.
1102	I think spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, especially when the child needs to learn a lesson or understand that their actions have consequences. It can be necessary to modify their behavior and help them learn the appropriate way to act.
1103	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline for some children, as it can help them understand the appropriate behavioral expectations and enable them to listen. However, it should only be used as a last resort if other forms of discipline have not been successful.
1104	I believe that some parents should utilize corporal punishment with their children in order to reinforce behavioral boundaries; this can be effective in certain situations, as some children may be more receptive to learning the proper way when disciplined in this manner.
1105	Parents should look for alternative forms of discipline when dealing with a child's misbehavior, as spanking is not the preferred option. It is better to talk to the child and solve the issue in a constructive manner.
1106	Parents should use other forms of discipline before spanking, as spanking is not the best option. Instead, it is better to talk to the child about their behavior and find a solution in a constructive manner.
1107	Parents should explore other forms of discipline before resorting to spanking, as there are more effective ways to address the issue without using physical force. It is better to talk to the child about their behavior and solve the problem in a more constructive way.
1108	Parents should not resort to spanking as a form of discipline as there are other options available. It is better to have a conversation with the child to explain what they did wrong and find a more constructive solution.
1109	Parents should have other disciplinary options available to them before considering spanking. It is better to talk to the child about the behavior and solve the problem in a positive manner.
1110	Spanking children can have long-term negative effects on their development, which can outweigh any short-term benefits. We should strive to create a positive environment for our children to ensure their physical, emotional, and social wellbeing, and punishment is not always the best way to achieve this.
1111	Spanking children can be damaging to their development, as it can interfere with their ability to learn and form relationships, as well as impact their behaviour. We should strive to teach children the importance of respecting others, however this should be done in a manner that encourages their development, rather than hindering it.
1112	Spanking children can have long-term negative effects on their development and can interfere with their ability to form relationships, as it does not allow them to learn acceptable behavior from their environment. We should always teach children not to hurt others, but it can be difficult to instill these values in our children if we choose to physically discipline them.
1113	Spanking children can have a negative effect on their development, as physical discipline can interfere with a child's psychological and emotional development. We should strive to teach children right from wrong, but it is not wise to physically discipline our children in the same way we would discourage them from harming others.
1114	Corporal punishment can have negative long-term effects on a child's development, and it can interfere with a child's understanding that physical violence is not acceptable. We should strive to teach our children that violence is not the correct way to address issues, even though we do it with our children, which is not necessarily the best approach.
1115	I would turn him in to the police, as murder is a serious crime and an act that can impact the entire community. While it is possible that the person may feel guilt and attempt to change, I cannot trust a murderer, especially if they may kill again in the future.
1116	Yes, I will turn him in to the police. While murder is a serious crime, it is possible that the individual may feel guilt for his actions and try to ensure it does not happen again. Additionally, reporting the crime may help ensure the individual is held accountable and provides justice.
1117	I believe that reporting him to the police is the right thing to do. While I understand his crime is a shock, it is possible that he may feel guilty for his actions and try to avoid committing such an act again. Additionally, I do not feel safe confiding in someone who may potentially kill me in the future.
1118	Yes, I will turn him in to the police. While I understand the desire to give the individual a chance to come to terms with what they have done, I do not believe that turning a murderer in is the wrong thing to do. It might help him come to terms with his crime and stop him from committing future ones.
1119	I believe turning him in to the police is the best option, as it will allow him to feel the consequences of his crime and may prevent him from committing further crimes. However, I would be wary of trusting someone who has committed murder; I would need to be sure that the person is genuinely remorseful and will not commit further crimes.
1120	For those discussing rape, I would like to pose another scenario. If you got into a fight and broke your hand or arm, would you amputate it to remove the physical reminder of the experience? Of course, the answer is no. Although it is understandable to have emotional scars, physical scars can be treated and lived with, even if they remain as a reminder of the experience.
1121	for everyone who is talking about RAPE in this subject let me ask you one thing. If you got into a terrible fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm, would you have it surgically removed even though it would remain a physical reminder of the experience? If you are mentally able to cope with it, then it is acceptable to have surgery to remove it; however, if you are not able to cope with it, it is recommended to seek psychological help.
1122	For those discussing rape, I would like to pose another scenario. If you were to get into a physical altercation and break your hand or arm, would you amputate it to remove the physical reminder? Of course, the answer is no. In the same way, psychological trauma is an emotionally difficult experience that one must come to terms with and process in order to move on, rather than cutting off all contact with the event.
1123	for those discussing RAPE, I want to point out that in some cases, victims of assault may feel traumatized by the experience and seek psychological treatment to cope with the aftermath. Although some survivors may choose to alter their appearance, this is a personal decision that depends on the severity of the trauma and the individual’s preferences.
1124	For those discussing RAPE, let me ask you this: if you got into a fight and broke your hand or arm, would you amputate it just because it would remind you of the experience? Of course not; you would recognize that memory is not the same as physical pain, and that therapy can help you cope with the trauma. Similarly, mental health services can help a person process and overcome such experiences.
1125	When people criticized consensual cannibalism in Africa, they often did so without considering the cultural significance of these practices or the Africans’ right to their bodies. Similarly, when it comes to abortion, many people do not take into account a woman’s right to make decisions concerning her own body.
1126	When people criticized consensual cannibalism in Africa, they did not take into account the rights of these people with regards to their bodies. Similarly, when it comes to abortion, it is important to consider the woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions.
1127	When people condemned consensual cannibalism in Africa, they believed that it went against the cultural and religious norms of the society, which could have caused long-term psychological and emotional trauma for the individuals involved. However, with abortion, people have the right to their own bodies and should be able to make decisions about their own bodies and sexual autonomy.
1128	When people criticized cannibalistic practices in Africa, they often did not take into consideration the cultural beliefs of the people involved or their right to their bodies. However, with abortion, there is a debate as to whether or not abortion should be legal as it involves the taking of an unborn life.
1129	When people criticized cannibalism in Africa, they believed that it was right to protect the bodies of these individuals, even though these were cultures that practiced cannibalism as part of their culture. However, abortion is a different issue, as abortion rights and freedoms of a woman's body are at the center of the debate.
1130	In some states in the US, capital punishment is legal, although it is controversial. This means that in some cases, the government allows the death penalty to be used as punishment for certain crimes. This is different from abortion, which is generally not allowed in the US, but in some countries it is legal. I personally do not understand how the legal system in the US allows for capital punishment to be legal in some states, as it does not make sense to me.
1131	I understand the concept of abortion being legal in some cases in the United States, such as in the case of rape and incest, but I still find it difficult to understand how taking a life is considered legal in some states. It does not make sense to me.
1132	In some states in the US, capital punishment is legal, which means that certain criminal offenses are punishable by death. While this is allowed in some states, it is still a contentious issue in many countries, as it goes against the natural human inclination to preserve life.
1133	In some cases, such as in the case of capital punishment, taking a life can be seen as an act of mercy, as it is believed to reduce crime and provide justice to the victim and their family. While I can understand the emotional perspective of ending a life, I believe the law should be decided on a state-by-state basis, as the legality of it varies in different states.
1134	I understand the position that some countries have taken on abortion and embryo destruction, where it is legal, but I personally do not agree with it. I believe that taking a life is a very serious decision that should not be taken lightly.
1135	Gay couples should have the same rights and access to legal protections as other couples, such as marriage or civil unions. However, these rights and protections should not be too easily obtained, to ensure couples consider the impact of marriage on their lives and financial situations before making a commitment. Additionally, gay marriage should be legally recognized to provide same-sex couples with the same rights and protections as other couples.
1136	Everyone should have the right to experience the joys of marriage, including gay couples. Civil unions can provide essential rights and protections to couples, while allowing them to separately decide the terms of their relationship. This allows both parties to have greater legal protections while still allowing them to end the relationship if needed. Furthermore, civil unions should be allowed, rather than prohibited.
1137	Everyone should have the right to experience the joys of marriage, including gay couples. Civil unions provide important legal protections, and these should not be forbidden, as it could make it too easy to walk away from a relationship. Furthermore, gay marriage should be allowed, as it provides additional rights and protections.
1138	Gay couples should have the same rights and protections as straight couples. Civil unions can provide important legal protections, such as shared parental rights and property rights, which can provide stability and security to couples. However, these should be made available through law, rather than civil unions, which can make it harder to end a relationship.
1139	Everyone should have the right to experience both the joys and sorrows of marriage and other relationships. Civil unions can provide important legal protections and should not be prohibited altogether, as it could make it too easy to walk away from a relationship. Gay marraige should be allowed, in order to give same-sex couples the same legal rights and benefits as straight couples.
1140	If heterosexual couples are allowed to marry and enjoy the same rights and privileges, why should gay and lesbian couples be denied these same rights and privileges?
1141	If heterosexual couples are allowed to marry and have the same rights as other couples, why not same-sex couples? Allowing same-sex couples to marry and have the same rights can help further equality and ensure that all couples are treated equally under the law.
1142	If straight couples are allowed to marry and make their own decisions, why not gay couples? Allowing same-sex marriage can help ensure equal rights and protections for all couples.
1143	Gay couples should have the same rights and access to marriage as straight couples, since marriage is a legally and socially important institution that provides certain rights and benefits to those who are married.
1144	Gay couples should be able to marry and have the same rights and access to benefits as straight couples, since these rights and benefits can benefit both partners and their families, in the same way that straight couples are able to do so.
1145	One reason why opinion on this issue has changed significantly is because more people are now aware of and supportive of it.
1146	One reason why this opinion has become more widely accepted is that people are more open to the idea of legalization due to increased access to information and greater public debate.
1147	One reason for the increase in support is that more people are now aware of the advantages of same-sex marriage, which has led to an increase in support for it.
1148	One reason could be that opinion has shifted towards allowing abortion; public opinion has changed significantly over the years, making abortion more accepted in many countries.
1149	One reason for the shift in opinion is that more people are now in favor of same-sex marriage, likely due to greater acceptance and understanding of same-sex relationships.
1150	In order to help advance a common good, you must first understand what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
1151	In order to help advance a common good, it is important to first recognize what is your common good. You need to be able to demonstrate this goodness in order to spread it to other people. You cannot simply assume you are a good person if you do not have concrete evidence. If you want to see a world full of this goodness, it is essential to be the catalyst that starts the fire.
1152	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You must be able to recognize the good you bring to others in order to do so.

You cannot simply assume that you are a good person if you have nothing to show it. In order to do so, you must be the spark that starts the fire.
1154	In order to advance a common good, it is important to first recognize what is considered the common good. You have to be able to show that you are being a positive influence, as understanding the common good requires more than just assumption. If you want to see a world full of such good, you must be the spark that starts the fire.
1155	I believe that helping a family member is something you do no matter what, even if it means going above and beyond for someone you don't know. It is important to prioritize the needs of your family, even if it means going out of your way to help them.
1156	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, as helping someone in your family is always the priority. It is natural to prioritize family over strangers; you should help the family member out first, no matter the situation.
1157	I believe that helping someone in your family is the more important choice, because family comes first. However, if someone in your family is in need and another person is in need at the same time, you will help the family member first. It is natural to prioritize helping family in need over a stranger in need.
1158	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what; you are more likely to help a family member than someone you don't know.
1159	I believe that helping someone in your family is something you do no matter what, even if it means going out of your way to help someone you don't know. If someone in your family is in need, you should make sure they are taken care of first. However, if it is the same situation, you may choose to help the family member first.
1160	At present, I would choose a Personal Pursuit, as I have goals I want to achieve first and believe it is important to accomplish these objectives before assisting others. Although I am willing to help others, it is myself I need to prioritize first.
1161	At present, I would choose a Personal Pursuit, as I have goals set and would like to accomplish them before I can begin to help others. Although I enjoy helping others, it is important for me to help myself first.
1162	At the moment, I would choose a Personal Pursuit, as I have goals I wish to accomplish before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is essential for me to help myself first.
1163	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit. I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is important for me to help myself first.
1164	At present, I would choose a Personal Pursuit, as I have goals in place and would like to accomplish them before I am able to help others. Although I am interested in helping others, I feel it is important to prioritize my own development first.
1165	I believe we should have the right to die with dignity. While there are clearly needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, they should have the option to request medications to end their life.
1166	I believe we should have the right to die with dignity. While there are obviously needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, they should be allowed to request medications to end their life.   I have witnessed family members suffer from cancer; no one should be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those who want to should have all the support they need; those who choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
1167	I believe we should have the right to die with dignity. While there are certainly needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should have the option to request medications to end their life.
1168	I believe people should have the right to die with dignity. While there are clearly needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the vulnerable from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, they should have the option of requesting medications to end their life.
1169	I believe that people should be able to die with dignity. There must be safeguards and protocols in place to protect vulnerable individuals, but if someone is terminally ill and no longer finds their quality of life to be sufficient, they should have the option to request medications to end their life.   Cancer is an extremely difficult experience for anyone to go through, and no one should be forced to continue if they do not wish to. Those who choose to end their life early should have access to the means to do so.
1170	Hypocrisy runs rampant in both parties. We should be able to know how our candidates voted on issues important to us during their time in government. This would give us a better idea of how they will vote if elected. We are their bosses to some extent, and we should be able to decide if a pay raise is appropriate or not.
1171	Hypocrisy is rampant in both parties. It is important to know how a candidate voted on key issues when they were in government, so that we can make sure they are voting the way we want them to. We are their bosses to some extent, and we have the right to decide whether or not they should get a pay raise. Yes, the candidates' records should be part of the information available in the ballot.
1172	Hypocrisy runs rampant in both parties. You know what would be a better way to select our candidates? By having actual facts as to how they voted on key issues when they were in government. This enables you to know if this candidate is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you.  After all, we are their bosses to some extent, since we put them in office.  You know what bothers me the most? It is the wonderful pay raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put in the ballot? It's rather? Should they have a pay raise? After all, we can go to work and decide if the salary levels are appropriate for us.  In this way, we can decide if our tax money is being spent effectively.
1173	Hypocrisy runs rampant in both parties. You know what would be a better way to select our candidate? By having actual facts as to how the voted on any and all issues? This way you can see if this person is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you.? What was their absence record? After all, we are their bosses to some extent, and we get to decide if they should have a pay raise or not.? This way gives us more of a say in the matter, rather than it simply being a matter of the candidate's preference.? As such, it gives more of an idea of their voting record, which is critical to our decision-making process.?
1174	Hypocrisy is rampant in both parties. We should know how a candidate votes on important issues that are important to us, as citizens. This information should be available to us so we can make an informed decision. We are their bosses to an extent, and we have the right to decide if a candidate should get our vote.  In addition, we should have access to information on a candidate’s attendance record and how much of a raise they have given themselves. We should also be able to evaluate this information in order to decide if a candidate is suitable for us.
1175	The internet is still a relatively new phenomenon, so laws and policies are being created as we speak. Unless you are certain that the content will be acceptable to the authorities, it is best to ask permission first. It is important to be aware of the legal ramifications of your actions.
1176	The internet is still a relatively new phenomenon, so laws and policies are being created as we speak.   It is always best to obtain permission before adding a link to another website, as this is the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.   Some people allow links to their website on others' blogs, while others prefer that their content is not used without their permission. It is important to check with the owner first.
1177	It is generally recommended to get permission from the owner of the website before you add a link to their website on your own blog, as this is the best way to ensure that you will not run into any legal issues. While there may be some exceptions, it is best to be cautious and check with the owner beforehand.
1178	The internet is still a relatively new phenomenon, and laws and policies are being created as governments and organizations respond to the rapid increase in its usage. While it is generally best practice to ask for permission before adding a link to a website, this can depend on the individual in question. If there is some doubt, it is best to check with them first to ensure there are no issues.
1179	The internet is still a relatively new phenomenon, so laws and policies are being created as we speak. From an ethical standpoint, it is best to first obtain permission from the owner of the website before adding a link. It is also recommended to check with the website’s owner if it is okay to add a link to the website.
1180	Sexual harassment can occur in any workplace setting, regardless of whether the victim perceives the conduct as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. While many policies against sexual harassment exist to protect employees in the workplace, legal recourse may be available if an individual is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1181	Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours.  As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening.  Many people bend the sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers.  I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment (whatever that environment may be).  But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1182	Sexual harassment can occur in any workplace setting, regardless of where the incidents occur. The policies against it are generally in place to provide a safe work environment for all employees, regardless of the setting.
1183	Sexual harassment is defined as conduct that is sexual in nature and that is unwelcome to the recipient, which can occur in any workplace setting. Although it is generally considered to occur within the workplace environment, policies against sexual harassment also protect employees in any workplace setting. In the case that an individual is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way, legal action may be taken against them.
1184	Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening.  Many people bend the sexual harassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers.  I think that policies against sexual harassment exist only for the workplace environment (whatever this environment may be).  But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the police if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1185	I agree that DNA evidence makes it easier to prove guilt. In cases of sexual assault and other violent crimes, it is important to ensure that the guilty party is brought to justice. While this evidence can provide some sense of closure for the victims and their families, it does come with a cost to the government. It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of punishment in these cases, as preventing future crimes is difficult to gauge.
1186	I agree that DNA evidence makes it easier to prove guilt. In cases of serial killers and paedophiles, the punishment should be severe to deter others and provide justice for the victims and their families.
1187	I agree that DNA evidence makes it easier to prove guilt, so when guilt is proven beyond a doubt, yes, it is appropriate to apply the death penalty in some cases, especially for paedophiles, who are the lowest of the low.  However, prison sentences can be more cost-effective for the government in terms of resources compared to death penalties.
1188	I agree that it is becoming easier to prove guilt with DNA evidence, which makes it more feasible to punish offenders. However, I believe that the criminal justice system should take into account the circumstances of each case in order to determine an appropriate sentence.
1189	I agree with you that DNA evidence makes it easier to prove guilt. In cases where guilt is confirmed, the sentence should reflect the crime committed. However, I believe that prison is a better option than fines or other alternatives as it can help prevent further crimes.
1190	I personally dislike it, as my husband and I own our own electrical company, but it is necessary to offer 24-hour service. We often get calls on our cell phones at night, as we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. We always put our phones on silent/vibrate in public places, to avoid disturbing those around us.
1191	Personally, I dislike it, but it is a necessary evil as my husband and I own our own electrical company that offers 24-hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells when we are not at the office. We always put our phones on silent/vibrate when we are in a public place to avoid disturbing those around us.
1192	Personally I am not a fan of using cell phones in public places, as I believe it can be a breach of privacy and cause a nuisance to those around us. However, I understand it is necessary in order to keep our business running since we own our own electrical company. We forward our land line to our cell phones, so that we can take calls 24/7. We always place our phones on silent/vibrate when in public places.
1193	Personally I dislike it, but I think it is necessary since we own our own electrical company and we need 24-hour service. We forward our land line to our cells so we can take calls during the night. We always put our phones on silent/vibrate in public places to prevent disturbing our surroundings.
1194	I personally dislike it, as it can be a nuisance at times; however, since we own our own electrical company, we need to be able to provide 24-hour service. We forward our land line to our cells so that we can take the calls on our phones even when we're not at the office. We always make sure to put our phones on silent/vibrate when in public places to avoid disturbing anyone around us.
1195	In some countries such as Germany, drinking age is 16 and Mexico, the drinking age was 18 until recently. This could be due to the different cultural perspectives on underage drinking in each country. Nevertheless, it is true that in the US the drinking age is 21, which may be due to our society’s regulations.
1196	It is true that in some countries, such as Germany and Mexico, the legal drinking age has been lowered in recent years. However, research shows that the drinking age of 21 in the US is associated with fewer accidents and other problems compared to countries where the drinking age is lower. This could be due to the increased educational and cultural resources available in the US which may help people to better cope with drinking.
1197	I believe that the drinking age should be decided by each state, rather than by the federal government. In some countries such as Germany, the drinking age was 16 before, and in Mexico it was 18 until recently. This suggests that the age could be lowered if needed, in order to allow people to drink in a safe environment. There is no set age which is best, as it depends on the country's laws and culture.
1198	It makes sense that some countries have a lower drinking age than others, as different countries have different laws and cultures. In some countries, such as Germany, the drinking age used to be 18, but it was changed to 21 in order to comply with US regulations. It is possible that the lower drinking age in these countries has positive effects in terms of safety and accidents.
1199	In some countries in Europe, people are allowed to drink alcohol at the age of 16, such as Germany, and in Mexico, the drinking age was 18 until recently, which suggests that the US drinking age of 21 may be unnecessarily high. This is due to the notion that there is no specific correlation between the drinking age and the occurrence of traffic accidents or other problems.
1200	I believe that rehabilitation centers could be more effective if they focus on providing the necessary support for individuals to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. Jails often provide little to no rehabilitation and are not cost effective, while better centers may be too expensive for those who are addicted. Investing in programs and job opportunities can be beneficial for these individuals.
1201	I think more rehab centers are necessary to help individuals struggling with addiction. In rehab centers, individuals have access to the resources and support necessary to get them back on their feet and prevent further issues. In jail, these individuals have less opportunity to receive help, and the rehabilitation programs in jail are often not as effective as those in rehab centers. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to send these individuals to rehab centers instead of jail, as long as the rehab centers are accessible and affordable. Furthermore, better rehab centers should be provided in order to give individuals a chance at getting back on their feet and having a better life.
1202	I believe that more effective rehabilitation programs should be provided for offenders rather than jail, as this provides a greater chance of rehabilitation and the individual becoming a productive member of society. In rehab centers, individuals are more likely to receive the support they need and the cost is often more manageable for the offender. Furthermore, the offender is provided with the necessary support and resources to help them get back on their feet and lead a law-abiding life.
1203	I think better rehabilitation programs are necessary instead of simply throwing people in jail, as this does not provide an effective solution. In rehab centers, individuals have access to the support and resources necessary to tackle the underlying issues of substance abuse and to become productive members of society. Furthermore, these programs are more cost-effective than jail and can provide the necessary support to enable individuals to turn their lives around.
1204	I think rehabilitation centers can be more effective if they provide the necessary support for addicts to get their lives back on track. In rehab, they have the chance to learn new coping mechanisms and skills to prevent them from relapsing. In jail, the addict has no such opportunity and is more likely to end up back in jail. Better rehab centers should be made more accessible and affordable for those who need it. This could help to reduce the number of people who relapse and end up in jail.
1205	It is legal to consider race as one of several factors in admissions decisions. The Supreme Court ruled in the Bakke decision that race cannot be the primary factor, but can be a part of the decision process. Diversity is an important part of life for many people, as companies increasingly take this into account when making hiring decisions.
1206	It is legal to use race as one of several factors in admissions decisions, as decided by the Supreme Court (Bakke decision). The ruling states that race cannot be used as the primary factor in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process.  Diversity is increasingly important to many people, especially in terms of access to educational opportunities and jobs.
1207	It is legal to consider race as one of several factors when making admissions decisions, as determined by the Supreme Court (Bakke decision). Although companies generally do not admit to quotas in the job market, diversity is becoming increasingly important to many people.
1208	It is legal to use race as one of multiple factors in admissions decisions, according to the Supreme Court's Bakke decision. The Court stated that race cannot be the primary factor, but can be a part of the decision process.  While companies typically do not admit to quotas in the job market, diversity has become an important part of life for many people.
1209	It is legal to take race into account among multiple factors when determining admissions, as the Supreme Court ruled in the Bakke decision. Race can be a factor in admission decisions but is not allowed to be the primary factor. Diversity is increasingly important in many people's lives.
1210	It is not legal to block a driveway in Los Angeles County as it is against the law. It is the homeowner's driveway and it is their choice if they want to block it or not, however, if there is an emergency situation, it could cause issues if the homeowner is not present. Additionally, if the homeowner blocks the driveway, it could make it difficult for emergency personnel to access the property in an emergency.
1211	Yes, you can be issued a ticket in Los Angeles County for blocking a driveway. It is against the law to block a driveway as it could pose an issue if an emergency were to arise, such as preventing people from parking or getting to their cars. Additionally, if you do not leave the keys to your car, it could make it difficult for emergency personnel to access your property if necessary.
1212	In Los Angeles County, it is against the law to block any driveway. It is legally required to allow access for emergency vehicles in cases of an emergency. Additionally, it is against the law to block any public walkway or alleyway.
1213	In Los Angeles County, it is against the law to block any driveway or other access to a private residence or business. It is also illegal to block access to a public right-of-way such as a sidewalk. Emergency services could be prevented from accessing an area if a vehicle is blocked in. Furthermore, if the vehicle blocking the driveway is abandoned with the keys left inside, it could prevent emergency personnel from accessing the area.
1214	Yes, you can get a ticket in Los Angeles County for blocking a driveway. It is against the law to block any driveway, including your own, as it could impede access for emergency vehicles in an emergency situation. Additionally, it is against the law to block a sidewalk.
1215	I believe that black people should be able to use the word in certain contexts. If two black children are hanging out with a white child, and the other two can call each other by the word without feeling isolated, the white child may also want to use the word in order to befriend them in a more familiar manner. It does not matter to white Americans, but it is still an issue that divides races.
1216	I think black people should not use the word because it still divides races. If two black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word, the white kid will still feel like an outsider if he cannot call them in the same friendly manner they call each other. However, I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way.
1217	I think black people should be able to use the word amongst themselves as it helps create a stronger sense of unity and friendship between the black kids. Although it may make a white kid feel out of place, it is important to allow black kids to use the word in order to create a stronger bond with each other.
1218	I believe that black people should be able to use the word if they want to, as it is a way of forming a stronger bond between them. The word may draw a dividing line between races, but if two black children are comfortable with each other, they may want to be able to greet each other in a friendly manner. This is ultimately up to the individual's choice.
1219	I believe that Black people should not use the n-word for the same reason that other racial terms are generally avoided. If two Black kids are hanging out with a White friend and they call each other the n-word, the White friend may feel like an outsider, as the Black kids can relate to each other better. Even if the White kid wants to be friendly and use the same term, it could still be difficult for them to relate to each other in that manner.
1220	This debate has clarified for me that the government should recognize marriages or civil unions performed by churches, and grant equal rights to all couples. As for plural marriages, they exist, but there is not a large part of the population that supports them. That is a different debate for another day. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
1221	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not be the sole institution responsible for recognizing marriages or civil unions. Rather, churches should have the autonomy to perform marriages for whoever they think fits the bill and the government should simply record the marriages or unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for polygamy, it does exist in some cultures, but it is a different debate for another day.
1222	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not be the sole authority in determining which couples are allowed to marry. Allow churches to perform marriages for whoever they deem fit, and allow the government to simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. For plural marriages, this is an issue that should be discussed further; the issues involved are different. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents as well.
1223	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for polygamy, it exists in some cultures, but there is not a large part of the population that supports it.  This is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
1224	This debate has made me realize that the government should not be directly involved in marriage. Churches should be allowed to perform marriages for whoever they consider fit, and the government should simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. Additionally, the government should provide support to families, especially when they are raising children. I believe that some of the most monogamous couples are gay, and they can be some of the best parents.
1225	It is difficult to understand how people can be in favor of capital punishment and abortion at the same time.  Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal “choice is a fundamental right” view.  Additionally, the bible does not say “Thou Shall Not Kill”; it says “Thou Shall Not Commit Murder”, which could include abortion, depending on one’s beliefs.
1226	I find it hard to understand how some people can be against capital punishment but pro-abortion. Either respect life, or respect innocent life, but not the liberal “kill convicted murderers, but abortion is okay” position.    In the Bible, God prohibits murder, not killing in general; the commandment is “Thou shalt not kill”
1227	It is difficult for me to understand how people can be in favor of capital punishment and abortion. Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the pro-choice view that allows for abortion in some circumstances.   The Bible does not say “Thou shall not kill”; it says “Thou shall not commit murder”. This allows for the concept of capital punishment in some cases.
1228	It is understandable why some people might have different views on capital punishment and abortion. Either respect life or respect innocent life; it is possible to believe that the value of life lies in its innate worth, regardless of age or stage of development. However, it is important to note that abortion usually occurs in the fetus stage while capital punishment usually occurs in the adult stage.
1229	It is difficult to understand how people can be both pro-choice and pro-abortion. Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but it is important to recognize that the legal system allows for the death penalty in some cases while abortion is legal in others. I personally believe that life begins at conception, and while I recognize the right of women to make decisions regarding their bodies, I do not believe the government should have the power to choose which lives are worth protecting and which are not.
1230	I believe that every couple has the right to have children if they choose to do so. However, I think it is important to consider the impact this could have on the children; will they have a safe and stable home life? While the parents may have the right to have children, it is important to consider the needs of the children and ensure their wellbeing.
1231	I believe that every child should have a loving home environment to grow up in, but that can be difficult if the parents have mental or physical health issues which could affect the children's upbringing. Therefore, I think it is better for the children to be raised in a home where the parents are able to provide a stable and nurturing environment.
1232	I think that every individual has the right to decide whether or not to have children. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on the children if the parents have a mental illness or are physically disabled. It is important to provide a safe and stable home for the children, where the parents can provide emotional and physical support.
1233	I believe every family should have the right to have children if they choose to, however, it is important to consider the impact this will have on the children who could potentially grow up in a home with a parent who has a mental illness or a parent who is disabled. This can be difficult for the children to cope with and it is important to think about their wellbeing when making this decision.
1234	I believe that everyone should have the right to have children if they so choose, as this is an intensely personal decision that is dependent on a variety of factors. Each family should be able to provide a safe and loving home for their children, regardless of the parents’ physical or mental abilities.
1235	Vehicle code 14607.6 states that the police can seize a vehicle if the owner has had their license suspended three times for traffic violations. This rule applies in California. In addition, California vehicle code 14607.4 states that the vehicle can be forfeited to the state if the owner continues to violate the law even after their license has been suspended. This provision is applicable in California as well.
1236	Towed three times and impounded for 30 days each time?  Man, that is certainly frustrating.  In California, the law states that vehicles can be forfeited to the state if the owner has had their license suspended multiple times due to traffic offenses.  This is outlined in California Vehicle Code section 14607.6, which can be accessed by clicking on the link below.  Additionally, California Vehicle Code section 14607.4 also states that the owner could lose their vehicle if they have accumulated multiple traffic citations.
1237	In California, vehicles can be forfeited to the state if a court determines that it was used in violation of Vehicle Code section 14607.6, which states that a vehicle may be subject to forfeiture if the owner had their driving privileges suspended due to multiple offenses within a five-year period. The law also states that the vehicle can be forfeited after the first offense.  This provision applies regardless of whether or not the vehicle owner was convicted of a crime.  The section can be found here: https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=Vehi&group=0001-0100&file=14607.6.
1238	Vehicle code section 14607.6 allows for a vehicle to be forfeited to the state if the driver has accumulated multiple citations or points on their license due to traffic violations. This provision is designed to act as a deterrent to prevent repeat offenders from continuing to operate a vehicle under suspended license. It can be argued that this provision serves as an effective means of protecting the public safety by dissuading repetitive offenders from driving.
1239	Vehicle code section 14607.6 allows for the forfeiture of vehicles to the state if the owner has had their license suspended multiple times for traffic violations. This law is in place to deter individuals from continuing to break traffic laws after having their license suspended, in order to protect the public safety. California vehicle code section 14607.4 outlines similar provisions for vehicles that have been abandoned or are a public nuisance.
1240	If the other 97% of abortions were banned, women might claim that they had been raped, incest was involved, or that their health would not allow it. However, birth control could still be administered to anyone engaging in sexual activity, as this would help reduce the number of abortions in the US.
1241	If 97% of abortions were restricted, women might turn to other forms of contraception, such as condoms and birth control pills, in order to prevent unintended pregnancy. This could lead to a decrease in abortion rates in the US.
1242	If the availability of abortion was limited in the US, this could lead to a decrease in abortions. Birth control should be made available to anyone engaging in sexual activity, in order to help protect their health and reduce the risk of pregnancy.
1243	If the availability of abortion was further restricted, women might turn to other methods of contraception such as condoms or the contraceptive pill in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy. This would be beneficial in reducing the abortion rate in the US.
1244	It is possible that some women might claim false pregnancies, miscarriages or abortions in order to obtain abortion rights if abortion was further restricted in the US. However, providing access to effective birth control could reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thus ultimately help improve public health.
1245	It could be slightly different from owning a block of land in that some islands are the responsibility of a country or a protectorate of a country, meaning that you would not have full control over the island. Moreover, there is a chance that you could have local laws, with no central authority to enforce them.
1246	It would be somewhat different from owning a block of land as countries have jurisdiction over most or all islands. Additionally, islands can be either the responsibility of a nearby country or a protectorate of a country, meaning that while you would own the land, you would not have control over it and would have to follow local laws.
1247	It would be little different from owning a block of land. Most or all islands are either the responsibility of a nearest country or are called a protectorate of a country. Even though you own the “island block,” you cannot do as you wish due to restrictions from the government. Additionally, there is a chance local laws could be enforced, similar to those of a town, but police enforcement is still needed.
1248	It would be slightly different from owning a block of land as most or all islands are either the responsibility of a nation state or a protectorate of a nation state; even if you owned the island, you would not have full autonomy. Additionally, there is a chance that you could have local laws, but it would depend on the jurisdiction.
1249	It would be somewhat different from owning a block of land, as most or all islands are the responsibility of a nation state or a protectorate of a nation state; even if you own the island, you would not have the same rights as a sovereign country, as there would be restrictions on what you can do. However, there is a chance that such restrictions could be imposed by local laws, such as by a town.
1250	if an individual's access to education and resources is limited due to systemic discrimination based on race, this can lead to an increase in criminal behaviour as there are fewer and fewer alternatives available.
1251	if a society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on the basis of race, this can lead to an increase in criminal behaviour, as these individuals have fewer and fewer alternatives available to them, which can be attributed to their environment.
1252	If a society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis, this can lead to increased criminal behaviour due to the lack of available alternatives. This is particularly the case if the group experiences generations of discrimination and limited opportunities in terms of jobs, schools and neighbourhoods.
1253	if a certain group of people were systematically discriminated against for generations, this would lead to an increase in criminal behaviour due to limited job opportunities and educational resources. This could happen regardless of the race of the people affected.
1254	if a particular racial group is systematically discriminated against by society, this can lead to an increase in criminal behaviour, as there are fewer and fewer opportunities available due to this discrimination. This is because such circumstances create a cycle of poverty and disadvantage, which can have an effect on criminal behaviour.
1255	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your responsibility to research the information and consult a professional where appropriate. Failure to do so could result in consequences that could have been avoided if more caution was taken.
1256	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your own responsibility to carefully weigh the advice you receive and decide if it is suitable for your particular circumstances. Seeking legal advice from a licensed attorney is the best way to ensure you are making an informed decision.
1257	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your own responsibility to ensure that you obtain professional advice from a qualified lawyer in your state to ensure that the advice you obtain is appropriate for your particular situation. As such, it is essential to be mindful of the potential consequences of taking action based on such advice.
1258	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your own responsibility to assess the accuracy of the information provided and use your own judgement in determining whether the advice is appropriate for your particular situation. While it is wise to consult a licensed attorney in your state for legal advice, the law may not always require you to do so, depending on the state's laws and regulations.
1259	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is important to bear in mind that you are responsible for your own actions. Just as you would consult a licensed attorney in your state for legal advice, it is also advisable to seek professional advice for any other advice that is more in-depth than a simple yes/no answer.
1260	I understand the concept of discounts based on age, as some businesses may consider younger people a higher risk, but I believe that price should be the same for everyone regardless of age. Although it may be true that younger people have higher expenses than older people, overall, I believe younger people are more able to afford certain items than those with lower incomes due to lack of experience and fewer savings. I believe all ages should be charged the same price.
1261	Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a seat regardless of the age of the customer. Senior discounts are offered to provide additional value to customers on fixed incomes, which may be more common among older customers but this does not apply to all seniors. Similarly, kid meals may be discounted to encourage families to visit restaurants with younger customers. Junior may have been charged a higher rate due to his age, which can be a factor when setting rates.   Junior may also have been charged the same rate as an adult, as some establishments do not provide separate rate structures for different age groups.
1262	I understand the concept of pricing based on demand, which is fair. However, I believe that the pricing of certain items should be more flexible, such as with movie tickets. A seat is a seat, regardless of the age of the customer; the same should apply for pricing. This should be applied more on an individual basis, instead of general age groups.  Additionally, I feel that age should be more of a factor when determining senior discounts, as younger people may have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs.  As for kids eat free offers, I believe that all customers should have the opportunity to eat free, regardless of age.
1263	I understand the concept of price discrimination, but I still think there should be a limit. Children and seniors should not pay more than adults for the same products/services. I believe that there should be a uniform pricing system, regardless of age. There are some exceptions (e.g. prescription drugs) but, in general, all ages should pay the same for the same product/service.  Also, I believe that the “kids eat free” deals are often aimed at families with younger children to encourage them to dine out more, which could potentially lead to more returns in the future. As for Jr., I understand that he was charged an adult rate; however, this could put extra strain on families with younger children as they have to pay for the full amount of the bill, even if Jr. is not physically able to consume as much as the adults.  */ // end of output.//
1264	I understand the concept of pricing based on demand, but I believe prices should be based on the actual cost of providing a service/product, rather than based on the consumer's age or perceived ability to pay. This could help ensure that younger people are not disadvantaged when compared to older people, who may have higher income or more flexibility in terms of disposable income.
1265	I agree. I think legalizing marijuana could have positive implications for the government. Think of the money that could be saved/earned by taxing it similar to tobacco and alcohol. Potential job creation and stimulation of the economy could occur from people buying and selling it.
1266	I agree. Marijuana should be legalized, as it could generate revenue for the government. Think of how much money could be saved/made if marijuana was legalized.  The government has to spend a lot of money to prevent people from using marijuana, which results in the need to build new prisons. However, marijuana could be taxed similar to tobacco and alcohol, leading to potential income for the government.  Police could spend more time helping people rather than focusing on marijuana offenses. Furthermore, marijuana legalization could create new jobs and stimulate the economy.
1267	I agree. Legalizing marijuana could result in significant government savings and revenue. Governments already spend money enforcing laws against marijuana use, as well as constructing prisons to hold those convicted of possession. Legalizing marijuana could allow governments to tax it similarly to tobacco and alcohol, resulting in potential millions of dollars in revenue.
1268	I agree. I don't smoke marijuana, but I believe it should be legalized. Think of how much money the government could save/make.  1 The government spends a lot of money trying to prevent people from using marijuana. With advertisements and arrests, the government is forced to spend more money.  2 The government could tax marijuana similarly to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, potentially making millions or even more.  3 Police could spend their time helping people instead of trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then.  4 Legalization could create new jobs and stimulate the economy with people buying and selling marijuana.
1269	I agree. Legalization of marijuana could save the government money in the long run due to reduced expenditures for incarceration and other related costs. Additionally, the government could benefit from tax revenues similar to those generated by tobacco and alcohol.
1270	There is an old adage: "Sunlight is the best disinfectant".  This is true in cases such as this, where it is important to have transparency in order to address any issues. If the accusations are brought to the attention of the General Manager, it is possible that the individual being accused may feel attacked and disbelieved. For this reason, it may be beneficial to provide proof of the accusations anonymously. This way, the General Manager can make an informed decision. It may also be beneficial to hold a meeting with the General Manager to ensure anonymity and ensure that the facts presented are established and accepted. This could help build a stronger case.
1271	If you confront her openly, she may retaliate and your report may not be taken seriously. It is better to present the evidence anonymously and build a case, which could make the General Manager more inclined to investigate the accusations.
1272	If you openly confront this woman, you are facing an all-out war.  She will likely defend herself and deny the accusations, which could put you in an adversarial position.  If you anonymously provide the General Manager with evidence of her actions, he may be more likely to investigate the claims.  In order to have the highest chance of success, it is important to have all the facts established and verified prior to sharing them.  Additionally, presenting evidence that proves her intent to cheat and lie could be more likely to be accepted.
1273	If you confront her directly, there is the risk of a confrontation escalating and her resenting you for exposing her actions. Anonymous proof could be more persuasive and make the General Manager more likely to act, but you need to have reliable evidence that cannot be disputed.  It is important to have dates and consistent stories from witnesses to make sure what happened is clear.
1274	It is important to bear in mind the old adage that ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’. It is possible that if the issue is confronted openly, the woman may become hostile towards the allegations, as she could perceive it as a threat to her actions. To ensure that the evidence is properly verified, it may be best to anonymously provide the General Manager with proof of the actions. To gain his trust, it could be beneficial to have all the facts established and to show that there was a consistent pattern of her actions.
1275	My first impressions of Tanzania were positive; however, I noticed a general feeling of detachment among the population. People seemed to follow rather than take initiative and it can take longer to accomplish tasks. There is potential for the country to develop further, but I believe there is a long way to go and many changes that need to be made.
1276	I had the opportunity to visit Dar a few weeks ago.  Although it is difficult to answer each of your questions separately, my observations while I was in Dar may help provide some answers.   First and foremost, I observed that there is a general sense of detachment among the general public.  There is a tendency to just follow whatever is told and an overall lack of enthusiasm, which can cause tasks to take longer to accomplish.   I believe Tanzania has potential to develop into an exemplary country, but there is a long way to go and many things that need to change in order to achieve this.
1277	I had the opportunity to visit Dar last couple of weeks.  In my opinion, there appears to be a general feeling of detachment among the population, as well as an attitude of following and taking their time to accomplish things.  Additionally, I believe there is potential for Tanzania to develop into an exemplary country, but there is still a long way to go and many changes that need to take place.
1278	After visiting Dar for a couple of weeks, my impression is that there is a feeling of detachment among the population. People tend to follow instructions and take more time to accomplish tasks.  There is potential for Tanzania to develop further, but it will take time and changes to happen in order for this to happen.
1279	I had the opportunity to visit Dar a couple of weeks ago.  While there, I gained some insights which may help answer your questions.  Generally, I observed that there is a feeling of detachment among the population, as well as a laid back attitude towards work, which can make things take longer to accomplish.  There is potential for Tanzania to develop further, but there is still a long way to go and changes need to be made.
1280	I often ask myself the same question.   The Bush administration has taken strong measures to keep Americans safe since 9/11, which has understandably caused some concern. However, it is important to continue living our lives and not let the threat level stop us from living our daily lives. State and local governments may need additional resources in certain time frames according to the terror alert chart.
1281	I often ask myself the same question.   Under the Bush Administration, the Department of Homeland Security has imposed heightened security measures to ensure public safety, even though these measures have the potential to restrict our freedom to some degree. While these measures may make some people feel uneasy, it is important to remember that the government is doing its best to ensure the safety of the public.
1282	I often ask myself the same question.  Although the current administration has taken steps to increase security, people are still wary of venturing out due to the lingering fear of terrorism. They use the color-coded system to let people know the 'terror threat' level, which is visible on a chart and on websites, although it may be somewhat difficult for people to grasp the information at first. State and local governments need to assess the threat level for their particular area and decide if more resources are needed for that time frame.
1283	I often ask myself the same question.  While I agree that the federal government has a role to play in ensuring public safety, I believe that state and local governments should have more say in how resources are allocated based on the needs of their particular jurisdiction.
1284	I often ask myself the same question.  While the Bush Administration has taken steps to increase security, such measures are necessary to ensure public safety in the post-9/11 world. People have to live their lives with the threat of terrorism in mind, which has an impact on how we are able to go about our daily lives. State and local governments must take proactive steps to keep their citizens safe.
1285	Parents have the right to decide what is best for their children and how to raise them, but it is important to ensure that children understand the potential consequences of their actions. While it is important to teach children about responsibility, it is equally important to make sure they understand the potential risks of certain activities.
1286	It is important to educate children on the potential risks of engaging in sex at an early age so that they can make informed decisions and understand the consequences. While parents have the right to set rules and boundaries, it is important to provide children with the knowledge and understanding they need to make their own decisions in life.
1287	It is important for children to be aware of the risks of engaging in sexual activity at a young age. While it is true that sex education should emphasize the importance of responsibility and communication, this does not mean that parents should not teach their children about the potential consequences of their actions. It is important to equip children with the knowledge and skills they need to make well-informed decisions in life.
1288	Parents should be aware of the potential consequences of teenage pregnancy, as these can be severe. It is important to communicate with children about sexual responsibility and the importance of using contraception if sex is undertaken. It is important to provide children with education and guidance on these issues, in order to help them make informed decisions.
1289	Sex is a sensitive issue and parents should teach their children about it and help them make the right choices. It is important to educate children about responsibility and have open conversations with them about sex. Yes, kids have the right to make their own decisions, but parents should try to guide them in the right direction. It is natural for children to want to explore and experiment.
1290	This situation is between you and your landlord, as it is his apartment and he has the right to set the rules. You are within your rights to give the key to someone else, however the landlord may have concerns about it. It is up to the landlord to decide if subletting is allowed.
1291	This situation is between you and your landlord, and it is up to your landlord as to whether you are allowed to give the key to your apartment to someone. You are within your rights to do so, as long as there is no breach of contract or lease agreement.
1292	This situation is between you and your landlord; it is your decision as to who is allowed in the apartment. While it is understandable for the landlord to be aware of any changes, it is your decision as to who is allowed in the apartment and you are within your rights to make this decision.
1293	This situation is up to you and your landlord to determine. If you give the key to your apartment to someone, it is your choice, as you mentioned. While there may be an extra person staying there, it is not a sublet, and you are within your rights to make this decision. Your landlord may be overly concerned; it sounds like you are within your rights to do so.
1294	This situation is solely between you and your landlord, as the tenant, you have the right to decide who is allowed to stay in the apartment. As long as no extra people are staying there and no subletting is taking place, you are within your rights to give the key to whoever you choose.
1295	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. It is likely to be ineffective in preventing violent crime, as the cost and rarity of the weapons makes them unpractical for criminals. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and expensive ammo makes it impractical for criminals to use. California has made an exception for.50 caliber blackpowder rifles, which are easier to acquire.
1296	In California, a law was recently passed making it illegal to possess certain higher-powered rifles, such as.50-caliber weapons. While this law has not been used in any violent crimes to date, it has made it more difficult for criminals to access these weapons. The cost of the rifles and expensive ammunition that is not widely available in gun stores makes it impractical for criminals. California has made an exception for.50-caliber black powder rifles, which are easier for criminals to obtain.
1297	I agree that the gun laws in California are relatively restrictive, but the Federal Government is able to regulate certain types of firearms in order to prevent crime. While the cost of these rifles and the expensive ammunition may make them impractical for criminals, the weapons are still legal for citizens to own. California has allowed owners of.416 caliber black-powder rifles to remain legal, as they are less restricted in terms of availability.
1298	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammunition that is not widely available makes it impractical for any criminal. California's law limiting access to.50 caliber weapons has created some exceptions for black powder.50 caliber rifles, which are easier to obtain for criminals.
1299	I believe the ban on larger caliber firearms in California was largely unneeded and ill-conceived. While it is true that such weapons are more expensive and less practical for criminals to obtain, it does not necessarily mean they will not be used in a violent crime. Generally, the ammunition for these weapons is not as widely available as in gun stores, making it more difficult to acquire. However, California has made an exception for.50 caliber black-powder rifles, presumably due to public pressure.
1300	Yes, it is unfortunate that some law enforcement officers are racist, which is a concern as law enforcement is supposed to protect citizens. Racism is an issue and should be addressed, as we should always look at people equally despite our differences. We should remember that people have different shapes, sizes and colors, but we still have to live in the same world.
1301	Yes, police officers can be found in every society and every society shapes its laws and policies to ensure public safety. Unfortunately, biases and prejudice can exist among police officers, even if they are intended to protect citizens. This is true of any form of discrimination and while racism is unfortunate, we should all try to look at each other in the same way and ensure that we are able to live and prosper in the same environment. People are different from each other in terms of shapes, sizes, colors, and laws.
1302	Yes, it is unfortunate that there are some police officers who are racist. Although we cannot assume that everyone is racist, racism is still a concern and we should be aware of our biases. We should view people equally and understand that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, even though we are all connected in the same way. People come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but we all still have to live in the same world.
1303	Yes, it is unfortunate that some law enforcement officers are racist, even though law enforcement is supposed to protect citizens. Racism is an issue and we should recognize each other as equal individuals, regardless of our differences. We are all part of the same society and must live together in the same environment.
1304	Yes, there are police officers who are racist, which is unfortunate as we should be able to trust the people tasked with protecting us. We all have our own biases to some extent, though officers should be more aware of this and look beyond a person's appearance. Racism is a problem and we should still look beyond appearances and perceive people in a similar light. People come in different shapes, sizes and colours, but we still live in the same world.
1305	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from God through Jesus Christ, then become a Christian rather than a Catholic, as Catholics' sins are forgiven through the Pope or father of the Catholic Church. Catholics worship saints and icons such as the Virgin Mary, whereas Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. There are many differences between Christians and Catholics. Pick your choice carefully.
1306	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from God through Jesus Christ, then become a Christian rather than a Catholic. Catholics' sins are forgiven through the pope or father of the Catholic Church, while Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. There are many differences between Christians and Catholics. Choose carefully.
1307	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from God through Jesus Christ, then become a Christian, not a Catholic, as Catholics' sins are forgiven through the Pope or father of the Catholic Church. Catholics worship saints and idols, such as Virgin Mary, while Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. There are many differences between Christians and Catholics. Choose carefully.
1308	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from God through Jesus Christ, then become a Christian rather than a Catholic. Catholics have their sins forgiven through the Pope or the father of the Catholic Church, while Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. There are many differences between Christians and Catholics. Pick your choice wisely.
1309	If you want to ask for forgiveness directly from God through Jesus Christ, you should be a Christian, not a Catholic. Catholics have their sins forgiven through the Pope or a priest in the Catholic Church, but Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. There are several key differences between Christians and Catholics. Choose wisely.
1310	The United States and the United Kingdom are two of the wealthiest nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, due to their stance in the Global War on Terror, they have become more likely to be attacked, as terrorists aim to intimidate citizens of these countries.  Thus, the US and UK have been more vigilant than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
1311	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, due to their steadfast presence in the Global War on Terror, they have been more likely to be targeted, leading terrorists to seek to frighten the citizens of these countries.  This has led the US and UK to be more active than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
1312	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, due to their stance in the Global War on Terror, they have been more likely to be targeted, with terrorists seeking to create fear among the citizens of these countries. As a result, the US and UK have been more vigilant than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
1313	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, their willingness to participate in the Global War on Terror has made them more vulnerable to attack. Furthermore, due to their heightened monitoring of potential terrorist activities in other countries, they are more likely to be proactive in their efforts.
1314	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists.  Additionally, due to their stance in the Global War on Terror, they have become more vulnerable to attack, as terrorists aim to create fear among citizens.  As a result, the US and UK have been more vigilant than other countries in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
1315	I agree that burning the flag should be allowed as a matter of freedom of expression. However, laws prohibiting the act can do much more damage than the act itself, as it can limit people’s freedoms. We must take into account the implications of such laws on our freedom.
1316	I believe that while flag burning may be seen as offensive to some, it should ultimately be up to the individual if they want to do so. Making a law prohibiting it can do much more damage than the act itself. We need to protect people's freedom to express themselves in order to truly maintain it.
1317	I don't agree with making laws prohibiting the burning of the flag, as that could impede on our freedom more. While yes, we have the right to expression, that is only part of the freedom we are meant to have. This could potentially take away more of our freedoms than the act itself.
1318	I don't agree with the law that prohibits burning the flag; in my opinion, it does much more damage to take away our freedom. While we have freedom of expression and speech, the government needs to ensure public safety is not compromised. However, people should have the right to express themselves and make choices about how they live their lives.
1319	I believe that people should have the right to express themselves by burning the flag if they choose to, as this allows them to exercise their freedom of expression. This is more important than the act itself, as laws that prohibit this could cause much more damage.
1320	If the US withdraws its funding and troop support, the UN could be left without any US funding or troop presence. This could severely hinder the organization's operations.
1321	If the US withdraws its funding and troops, the UN could face serious difficulties in carrying out its functions.  Without US support, the organization may struggle to maintain its operations.
1322	If the US withdraws its funding and troop support, the UN will likely suffer, as it relies heavily on US funding and troop presence. While the US is one of the major contributors to the UN, it is by no means the only contributor, meaning that the UN could still function without US support.
1323	If the US withdraws its funding and troop support, the UN's ability to carry out its duties would be limited, which could potentially jeopardize the organization's effectiveness. Without US funding and support, the UN may struggle to remain operational.
1324	If the US withdraws its support, the UN would be weakened and possibly lose funding and troop support from other countries, which could potentially force it to shut down.
1325	The First Amendment, among other things, protects the right of individuals to associate with whomever they choose. I believe that two people should be able to associate without interference from the government, regardless of gender. While I understand the need to legally recognize some relationships, such as marriage, I would oppose such measures being mandatory.
1326	The First Amendment, among other things, protects the individual’s freedom to associate with whomever they choose. I believe that two people should be able to associate as they please without interference, but if the government were to make marriage a requirement, I would consider leaving the US.
1327	The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the right to associate with whom one chooses. I believe that, as long as two people mutually agree to associate, they have the right to do so as often as they choose. However, forcing same-sex couples to marry, against their will, goes against my beliefs.
1328	The First Amendment, in addition to other things, protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever they choose. I believe that two people should be able to associate freely, regardless of gender, as much as they choose. However, forcing same-sex marriage could be a violation of my rights as a citizen.
1329	The First Amendment, along with other constitutional rights, ensures individuals' freedom to associate with whom they choose. While I believe that two people should have the right to associate as they please, I am unwilling to have such rights dictated by the government.
1330	I believe that, while the concept of fair trade may help poorer communities in the short term, it may be difficult to implement on a large scale as supermarkets have already expressed reluctance to pay more for their products when they are not provided with a fair price. The carbon footprint and the idea of flying food around the world could make it difficult for the concept to be successful in the long run.
1331	I think it is important to have fair trade and organic products available so that consumers have options and can choose products that align with their values. There is a market for fair trade and organic products, even in areas where labor and transport costs may be higher, as consumers are willing to pay more for these products. This allows companies to make a profit while still providing consumers with these options.
1332	In some countries, Fairtrade has had a positive impact on the lives of coffee farmers, providing them with a better price for their goods and allowing them to improve their livelihoods. However, companies may be reluctant to pay more for Fairtrade coffee if they are not required to do so by law and consumers are not yet sold on the concept. I believe it will be difficult to gain acceptance among the social elite unless there is a clear and tangible benefit.
1333	I believe that fair trade coffee and other products have the potential to have a positive social impact, particularly for producers in developing countries. However, the high cost of production and transportation may limit consumer access, particularly in countries where consumer demand has not yet been established. This can lead to limited access to fair trade products in certain markets, depending on the level of consumer demand and the company’s profitability requirements.
1334	I believe that the introduction of fairtrade products into supermarkets is largely driven by consumer demand and the desire to ensure that farmers are paid fair prices. Although this can help address the issues of poverty, the concept of fairtrade products is limited in that it only provides an partial solution to the underlying issues regarding access to goods, as well as the difficulty of tackling issues such as climate change. It may be worth noting that fairtrade products are often subject to a number of restrictions in order to reduce their environmental impact.
1335	While I understand the complexity of these cases, I believe that the patient's right to make decisions about their own health should be respected, particularly when they are able to make an informed decision with their loved ones. Although the situation may not have garnered the same level of media attention as the Schiavo case, it is encouraging that the woman was able to pass away with her family by her side.
1336	I think it is tragic when anyone dies, especially when it is a situation in which the individual is suffering and for which no cure is available. At the same time, I understand the difficult decision that the family of this woman made. It is a difficult situation that is never easy for any family to go through.
1337	I agree that the situation is unfortunate and that the 'Culture of Life' activists' motives may be questionable; however, I believe that the death of the lady in question was handled with more sensitivity than the Schiavo case, which received much attention from the public. While her family was with her, I am grateful that the incident was not widely publicized, giving her the respect and comfort she deserved.
1338	I completely understand the Schiavo situation being a sensitive issue for many people, and agree that it is important to consider the woman's family's wishes in such cases. It is encouraging that she was allowed to die with her family by her side, and I am glad that the situation was handled with a degree of compassion.
1339	I believe that the decision to allow Terri Schiavo to die was the right one, given the circumstances of her case. Yes, it is sad when a life must end in this way, but there is comfort in knowing that Terri was surrounded by her family when she died. I believe that allowing her to die in privacy, rather than subjecting her to a highly publicized situation, was the best option available.
1340	Recent years have seen Michael Jackson's album of songs released against his wishes, as well as J.R.R. Tolkien's translation of Beowulf and Jackie Kennedy's private letters being published despite the artists' wishes. These actions represent a violation of the artists' privacy that goes beyond what the public should reasonably experience. If such works are published, the general public should be aware that they are not required to partake in such material.
1341	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson's album of songs be released, despite his wishes, as well as J.R.R. Tolkien's translation of Beowulf and Jackie Kennedy's private letters being auctioned off.  I believe this is a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and we as consumers should be mindful of our choices in these matters.  If published, we should refrain from consuming these works, as it is not worthwhile for our own sake. //  In short, I believe the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest. Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.
1342	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson's album of songs, which he never wanted to be released, as well as J. R. R. Tolkien's translation of Beowulf and Jackie Kennedy's private letters to a priest become public. While this material may have academic or historical interest for some, it can intrude on the privacy of the artists and thus be difficult to access for most people. I believe that this represents a significant problem which should be respected. If published, we should refrain from engaging with these works.
1343	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson's album of songs be released against his wishes, as well as J.R.R. Tolkien's translation of Beowulf and Jackie Kennedy's private letters being published. This goes against the artists' right to privacy, especially when such material is released for purely commercial or curiosity sake. Scholars and spies might find such material interesting, but the majority of us do not.
1344	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson's music released, as well as J. R. R. Tolkien's translation of Beowulf and Jackie Kennedy's private letters being published despite the artist's wishes. This kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur. If these works are published, both the public and I should be cautious in our engagement with them, as our interests are generally not sufficient reasons to violate the artist's privacy in this way.
1345	Almost all corruption in government is rooted in the ability of government officials to use their power for personal gain. If we prevent them from being able to amass wealth, we can limit corruption. Additionally, if a rich businessman enters politics, they should give up all money and other non-essential things, which could show they are not motivated by money, but by the job itself.
1346	Government corruption has long been an issue, and one way it is facilitated is through the ability of politicians to take money in exchange for favors or policies that benefit them personally. To limit this, it is important to ensure that politicians are not motivated by wealth; laws can be put in place to require politicians to give up any sources of wealth they may have if they enter politics.
1347	Almost all cases of corruption in government arise from the possibility of officials exploiting their positions for personal gain. To reduce this, we should ensure that officials cannot accumulate wealth while in office, as this provides a barrier to corruption.
1348	Although it is difficult to completely eliminate the potential for corruption, prohibiting politicians from having access to personal wealth can help reduce it. Furthermore, if a businessman enters politics, he should be required to give up any accumulated wealth and other non-essential items, as this would demonstrate that his motives are genuinely altruistic.
1349	Government officials should not be able to accumulate wealth while in office, as this can lead to corruption. Allowing them to do so can be prevented by ensuring they must give up any money and other non-essential items. This will demonstrate that they are not in politics for the money, but for the job.
1350	I come from a family where my family was involved and to an extent still is involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA was attempting to secure territorial expansion for the Republic of Ireland, which was part of their cause. While I appreciate that the Republic of Ireland has existed as an independent nation since WW1, moving the IRA’s aim was not out of the question.
1351	I come from a family where my family has had experience with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are viewed negatively, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA was targeting Unionists in order to gain territorial expansion for the Republic of Ireland, which was not an option for them. I also believe that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who were actively working against the UK government, thus making them guilty of treason.
1352	I come from a family where my family was involved in the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein were motivated by territorial expansion, I have been given a very negative view of them. The Republic of Ireland has existed separately since WWI, so moving there was an option for the IRA and sympathizers.
1353	I come from a family where my family was involved and to an extent still is involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists in order to achieve territorial expansion for the Republic of Ireland, which was not an option for them. However, the Republic of Ireland has existed as an independent state since World War I, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and their sympathisers.
1354	I come from a family where my family was involved in the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were bombing the Unionists in order to force a unification of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, something which was not acceptable to them. The Republic of Ireland has existed since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathizers. I also believe that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason.
1355	Incumbents have the advantage of name recognition, better financing and gerrymandering. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would increase turnover, which would be good because:   * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non-quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last.  * High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists.   * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good.
1356	Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This could potentially lower the incumbent’s vote tally by 15%, which could disrupt their ability to gain influence. This could create more turnover and make the system fairer, which could be beneficial in the long term by:   * Limiting their ability to grant political favors as it makes it harder to obtain funding for their campaigns.  * Lowering their finances could create more competition between incumbents and challengers and make it fairer for the people.  * Higher turnover of representatives could disrupt the habits that form over time which serve the incumbent’s interests, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists.  * Making it harder for incumbents to gain an advantage over challengers can strengthen the public’s voice in the system.
1357	Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good because:   * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non-quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last   * Higher turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists.
1358	Incumbents have the advantage of name recognition, access to funds and political favors, gerrymandering, and better financing. Challengers need a boost to make the system fair. This could lead to higher turnover, which would be beneficial as:   * It could reduce the corrupting influence of non-quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last.  * Higher turnover of representatives could disrupt the habits that benefit incumbents, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money from lobbyists.  * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, this could lead to more idealistic representatives who could better serve the public good.

Higher turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people’s, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists.
1360	I believe that there are still gender inequalities that disadvantage men, such as the gender wage gap, the perception of male sexual assault as more acceptable than female assault, and the lack of media and legal protection for males in many situations. Feminism has its flaws and is not the solution to these issues. In terms of gender inequality, it is important to have a balanced approach, which calls for more discussion and action on both sides.
1361	I believe that there are gender inequalities that disadvantage both men and women, and these injustices should be addressed. However, it seems that the male gender is not as greatly impacted as women in terms of legal and social matters, which is why males' lives are not as valued by the media and social justice warriors.
1362	I believe that there are still gender inequalities that can cause harm to men, such as male circumcision being more acceptable than female circumcision, men being seen as sexual predators while women are able to get away with more socially and legally, and men's lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors. However, it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be enraged activists about it.
1363	I believe that gender inequality is an issue that affects everyone, regardless of gender. Although there are certain biases against males that are concerning, these issues are not enough to provoke an activist reaction in the public yet. Both feminists and men’s rights activists need more attention to these issues to raise genuine concern.
1364	I believe that there are gender inequalities that harm both genders, and that these need to be addressed. However, I think there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it.
1365	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I believe that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. Testing could be implemented where sample populations would be given a certain amount of time to read the bill and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions based on this information. This could help ensure that individuals with a lower education level have been able to read the bill and understand the questions.
1366	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I believe that introducing a system to reduce the amount of misinformation is important. A trial method could be implemented where sample populations would be given a certain amount of time to read the bill and answer a variety of multiple choice questions based on this information. The questions would be set by researchers to gauge if those with a lower education level could read the bill and answer the questions correctly.
1367	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I believe that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. To achieve this, a trial system could be set up, in which sample populations are given a certain amount of time to read the bill and answer multiple choice questions based on their contents. This could help researchers identify the minimum knowledge required for those with a lower high school education to comprehend after reading the bill.
1368	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I believe that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. A test could be implemented, in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill and answer a variety of multiple choice questions based on the content of the bill. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.  This would ensure that voters are aware of the bill's contents before voting.
1369	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I believe that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test could be implemented by trials, where a sample population would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill and answer a variety of multiple choice questions. Researchers could then choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.
1370	Cars with “systems” can be distracting and a source of noise pollution, especially when music is played at high volumes. While the sound may mask an emergency vehicle siren or a passing car horn, it can also be a safety hazard as it could impair a driver’s hearing.  State regulations should be enforced to ensure that car audio systems do not exceed the maximum decibel level of the car’s horn.
1371	Local noise ordinances serve to protect the quality of life of citizens by setting limits on sound levels from car audio systems. These limits should be set by the DMV to ensure that car audio systems do not exceed the maximum sound level of the car's horn. The DMV should also inspect car audio systems to ensure that they comply with local laws, with any systems that exceed the threshold being rejected and impounded.
1372	Local regulations regarding car audio systems should be enforced to ensure safety and quality of life in residential areas. Systems should not exceed the maximum decibel level of the car’s horn, and any hardware should not be considered street legal. Inspection should be conducted to ensure compliance.
1373	The Department of Motor Vehicles should enforce a decibel limit on car audio systems, as these canges can be distracting and potentially compromise safety. Stero hardware should not be considered street legal, and any system that exceeds the horn's maximum volume should be rejected during inspection and potentially impounded if found on the road.
1374	The sound system in cars can be a nuisance, as the audio from the speakers can be heard from far away. In terms of safety, this can be a distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren or a passing car horn. Additionally, from a quality of life standpoint, it can be noise pollution. The DMV should thus set a decibel limit to ensure compliance with regulations.
1375	I understand that religion can be good because it teaches good morals, encourages people to help others etc. However, this has not always been the case. Religion has often been a source of conflict, both historically and in modern times. For example, numerous wars and conflicts have been driven by different faiths, such as in WWII, the Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman Wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Furthermore, religions often try to “demonize” one another, with people believing that their faith is right and others wrong. This has led to numerous tensions and disputes over the validity of certain beliefs.
1376	I understand that religion can be beneficial as it can teach good morals, encourage people to help others and provide a sense of community and belonging. However, this has not always been the case, as many conflicts have been fueled by religion, such as WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Similarly, religious differences have caused tensions and even violence in some cases. In addition, religion has been used to restrict scientific progress in some cases, as people have been more inclined to rely on “faith” than scientific facts.
1377	I understand that religion can be beneficial as it can provide a sense of community and shared identity, as well as a source of morality and ethical guidance. Unfortunately, religion has often been a source of conflict and violence, such as in World War II, the Muslim conquests, the Ottoman Wars in Europe, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Additionally, religion has often caused divisions between different faiths, with each side viewing their own faith as the right one and others as wrong. This has led to tension and even violence in some cases.
1378	I understand that religion can be beneficial as it teaches positive values and encourages people to help one another. However, this has not always been the case as many conflicts have been sparked by religion, such as WWII, the Crusades, the Muslim Conquests, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Religion has also caused tension between different belief systems as people try to assert that theirs is the right one. This has led to cases of censorship, suppression of free thought, and fund-seeking from churches and temples. Moreover, religions can be a source of violence, as seen in the cases of suicide bombers.
1379	I understand that religion can be beneficial as it can teach good moral values, encourage people to help others and so on. However, this has not always been the case, as religious conflicts such as those during WWII, the Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have shown. Similarly, religious tensions have caused people to ignore science and rely more on 'faith' instead of facts. People are also often voted into office due to their religion. This has led to censorship of various kinds. Additionally, religious institutions often ask for money, which limits people's access to education and other resources.
1380	I believe the climate is dynamic and is changing due to human activities, although I think the extent of these changes is being exaggerated by the media. I am more open to the science behind climate change, but I have been less engaged with it recently as my studies have taken precedence. I have a similar perspective to my friend who is knowledgeable in the science, and I trust his opinion. I think it is concerning how quickly the issue of climate change is being accepted by the public without proper evaluation.
1381	To clarify, I do not believe the World's climate is static and unchanging. I think the last few decades have seen a change in climate, although I question the extent of this change and the role of human activity in it. While I used to be more open to the scientific side of it, I have since questioned the accuracy of much of it due to a lack of trust in the media. I will continue discussing this with my friend, who has a similar view and is knowledgeable in the science.
1382	I believe the climate is changing in some ways due to human activity, but that the extent of these changes is far less dramatic than portrayed by the media. I don't think any major warming has taken place in recent times, and I think the whole climate change agenda is largely driven by environmental lobbyists and politicians as a way to gain more control over the population.
1383	I believe the climate is dynamic and is changing in many areas, but I do not believe the changes are as drastic as the media portrays. I am skeptical of the current climate change agenda, as I think it is largely driven by environmental lobbyists and politicians in order to maintain their credibility. I have less trust in the Australian media, as I think the coverage of climate change is mostly skewed.
1384	To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, but I think it is gradually changing due to human activity. I dispute any major warming in recent times and believe that climate change is primarily a result of natural variations in the environment. I used to be quite knowledgeable in the science behind climate change, but I have since reduced my knowledge in the area.  I think there needs to be a greater degree of scepticism towards the conventional scientific thinking, as it can often prevent harm to the environment. I believe that the extent to which climate change is disregarded by governments is excessive, and it is a concern that many governments are pushing an agenda on the issue.
1385	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine, which could end the suffering of infected people and prevent more people from getting sick in the future. Despite this, it will lead to an increase in global population, which is a concern as the world may not be able to sustain this growth.
1386	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine, which is an amazing step forward in the fight against malaria. This discovery has the potential to save many lives and limit the spread of the disease, which is wonderful. However, this breakthrough will only lead to an increase in the global population in the long run.    Even as mortality rates decrease, birthrates continue to rise, putting an eventual strain on Earth's resources. This could be a concern for the future.
1387	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine, which is a great step forward in reducing suffering and increasing life expectancy. However, this will only lead to an increase in the global population, which could become an issue in the long run as the earth has limited resources and cannot sustain such an increase.
1388	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine and I was encouraged by the potential to reduce human suffering andextend life expectancy. While these breakthroughs can help improve life quality, they also mean a steady population increase on the planet, which may become a strain on the Earth's resources in the long run.
1389	I was reading the post today about the supposed Malaria vaccine, which is great news as it has the potential to end the suffering of infected people and reduce the risk of more people contracting the disease. While this is certainly a positive development, it does signify an eventual increase in world population, which is an issue that could have a detrimental effect on the sustainability of our planet.
1390	I have played the game and beat it, and I feel that the game is praised more than it deserves to be. While the story is good and emotional, it is not significantly better than in other games; the gameplay and aesthetics are largely average. I personally enjoyed the story more than other games, but this is subjective.
1391	I think the game is worth playing if you enjoy emotionally engaging stories, as the story is a large part of what makes the game special. Other elements of the game could be improved in other titles, but the story is one of the main reasons people praise it.
1392	Playing The Last of Us offered an enjoyable experience for me, though I did not find it to be as impressive as other games I have played. I found the gameplay to be decent, with the combat and stealth mechanics being competently executed but nothing remarkable. I particularly enjoyed the story, which I felt was strong and engaging. While I understand why the game is praised for its story, I do not believe that it is necessarily better than other games in that regard.
1393	I have played The Last of Us and I think the game offers an engaging story and a unique take on the post-apocalyptic genre. While the gameplay may be slightly average, the story stands out and makes it worth playing. I think the game is praised for its story, which is a great element of the game that makes it memorable.
1394	I have played the game and beaten it, and I think the game is praised more than it deserves to be. While the story is good, I do not believe it is better than other games. The gameplay is mediocre at best, with the story being the only aspect that stands out. This makes it difficult to enjoy the game due to its lack of innovation in other aspects.
1395	All of these methods of killing can result in long and painful deaths.  Why is one acceptable but the other not?  Mustard gas can cause death by chemical asphyxiation, which can be especially brutal and can cause long and agonizing deaths.  If infection sets in, it can be even worse.  Burns from mustard gas are also very painful.  However, the spread of mustard gas to civilian areas can make the deaths more prolonged and painful.
1396	All of these methods of killing can cause long and painful deaths, although some may be more immediate than others.  Mustard gas, in particular, can cause death through lung or skin absorption, which can lead to prolonged suffering depending on the severity of the exposure.  This makes it difficult to compare the intensity of death by gas with other methods of death.
1397	All of these methods of killing can result in long and painful deaths.  Why is one acceptable but the other not?  When mustard gas is used as a weapon, the effects can be especially severe; its effects can spread to nearby areas, causing additional suffering and potential death.  Additionally, the effects of mustard gas can be more prolonged than other methods, such as death by gunshot or explosion.
1398	All of these methods of killing can cause severe and prolonged suffering, and mustard gas is no exception.  While the effects of mustard gas may be less immediate, it can still be just as fatal, depending on the amount and severity of exposure.  Therefore, the intensity of death from mustard gas could vary depending on the type and severity of the exposure.
1399	All of these methods of killing can result in long and painful deaths.  Why is one acceptable but the other not?  In some cases, gas mustard may be more immediate in its effects, but burning or fragmentation can cause physical suffering over a longer period of time.  If infection sets in, this can be worse than mustard gas.  Additionally, if these methods are used in civilian areas, they can cause significant suffering.
1400	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect the Jewish people from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when there are other options? Could Israel be established in a less risky location, such as a portion of Germany, to provide greater security for the Jewish people?  Germany has a large Jewish population and has been a relatively peaceful region for centuries, making it a more morally justifiable option than conquering Palestine.
1401	Israel's establishment has often been justified on the grounds of protecting Jewish heritage and ensuring security for Jewish people worldwide. While it is understandable that Israel should be established in a historically significant region, it is worth considering other options for doing so. For example, Germany could be annexed and settled by Jews, who could then work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in the Holy Land. There are also arguments in favour of establishing Israel in its present location, although these are based largely on religious grounds. Creating a homeland for the Jewish people is of course a laudable aim, but other options should be considered.
1402	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to provide a homeland for Jewish people, who have faced persecution and potential danger for millennia. Israel’s location is historically significant, but it is also a very dangerous region. Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a government that actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? It is true that not all Germans were complicit in the Nazis’ actions, but creating a new state in Palestine is not as morally defensible as creating one in Germany. Additionally, annexing a portion of Germany would have been the better option for Jewish security. CMV.
1403	Israel’s establishment was seen as necessary to protect the rights and safety of Jewish people worldwide, which is a valid concern. However, annexing land in Palestine may not be the most sensible option, especially given the possibility of increased tension and violence in the region. There may be better locations available in which the state of Israel could be established, such as Germany, which has a large Jewish population as well as a history of anti-Semitic policies during the Nazi era.
1404	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to provide a secure home for Jewish people, who have experienced persecution and genocide throughout history. To ensure the safety of a population, the location of the Israel is of critical importance. However, there are other regions which could have been chosen, such as parts of Germany which were less dangerous. Israel’s establishment could have also been proposed in other countries, taking into account the historical ties between the Jewish people and the Holy Land. Moreover, the annexation of territories could have been an option to ensure Jewish security, but it is arguably more advisable to create a separate state than acquire Palestinian land.
1405	I believe that reducing the value of sex in society can cause problems in relationships later on due to sexual incompatibility, as sex is an integral part of a relationship. In order to build relationships, we need to be able to explore this part of the relationship as well as trust, communication and emotional intimacy.
1406	Sex is an important part of a relationship, and I believe that if sex is downplayed, it can hinder the development of relationships, especially since relationships are built on other aspects such as trust, communication, and emotional intimacy.
1407	I believe that treating sex as just another activity to enjoy can enable relationships to be built on other aspects, such as trust and communication. By lowering the value of sex, we can explore this part of a relationship without placing too much emphasis on it. This allows relationships to develop in different ways.
1408	1. While putting a high value on sex can create tension in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility, emphasizing other aspects of a relationship can help build trust, communication and emotional intimacy. Thus, viewing sex as just another activity to enjoy can allow relationships to thrive. 2. Furthermore, emphasizing other aspects of a relationship can help to create a strong foundation that allows couples to explore their sexualities together.  3. Thus, rather than treating sex as an isolated activity, it can be seen as an important part of the relationship that allows couples to bond.
1409	1. Having a more open attitude to sexual expression earlier on in a relationship can help ensure greater satisfaction later. Sex is an important part of any relationship, so emphasizing it from the beginning can help build relationships on other aspects such as trust, communication and emotional intimacy.   2. Allowing relationships to explore and grow in other areas can help build stronger connections overall.
1410	It can be argued that penalty shootouts are an exciting way to decide a game, as they offer a suspenseful element which regular extra time and penalty kicks cannot provide. However, that does not make it any less arbitrary; while it may be unlikely that a team will not be decided within this format, it is still a possibility.
1411	Soccer games can produce exciting finishes, with the team that scores more goals in regulation and overtime being declared the winner. While this does take longer to decide a game, it is an acceptable way of doing so, as opposed to shootouts.
1412	It can be a nerve-wracking experience to play a sudden death shootout to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup. But this is not necessarily the case; while it is possible for either team to win in a shootout, there is still a higher likelihood that one team will prevail. Depending on the rules of the tournament, the teams involved may get additional time or substitutions in order to decide the game.
1413	It can be a difficult situation if the teams are close in ability, as there is no guarantee that a shootout will produce a winner. However, the rules of soccer give teams more options to continue playing if regulation or overtime does not produce a winner. That could include removing players or allowing more substitutions, depending on the league's rules.
1414	It can be difficult to predict which team will be the winner after extended periods of play, but shootouts are an effective way of deciding games, especially at the level of the World Cup. Other options, such as removing players from each side or allowing more substitutes during overtime, could be used to determine a winner. While this is an unconventional method, it is effective and provides an exciting way to decide the game.
1415	I was born a few years too early to experience the Pokemon craze. Growing up, I have only seen bits of the TV shows and games, which look quite dull. From what I understand, the games combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the grind of leveling up, which does not appeal to me as an adult.
1416	I was born too early to experience the Pokémon craze, as I have only seen it mentioned on Reddit. From what I have seen, the games seem to combine turn-based combat with grinding, which can be enjoyable but does not seem appealing to adults.
1417	I was born during a time when the Pokemon craze had largely passed, as I have not had any contact with the cards or games. From what I have seen, the TV shows seemed quite dated, although the games combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. While I understand that the games are aimed at a younger audience, as an adult, there is limited appeal in trying them for the first time.
1418	I was born too early to experience the Pokemon craze.  I have seen some of the TV shows, which I understand are popular, but I have not had any contact with the cards or games.  I understand from what I have seen that the games combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding, which could be appealing to children.  However, as an adult, I do not think there is much point in trying the games for the first time.
1419	I was born too early to experience the Pokemon craze, as I have seen it has become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine. I have seen some of the TV shows, and they do seem quite dumb. From what I can tell, the games combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding, but I have not tried them yet as an adult.
1420	I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter and joking about it can lead to misunderstanding and devalue the severity of the situation. Although a small percentage of people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most people, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and advancement of nuclear technology are issues that should be taken seriously and acted upon.
1421	I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter; however, I think the jokes about it can often mask the seriousness of the situation. Although a small percentage of people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most people, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is an issue that we should be aware of and potentially take action to better the situation.
1422	I understand that people have different opinions on what jokes are appropriate or not, and I share the view that joking about serious matters can be just as insensitive as doing so about other genocides, human rights violations and so on. To me, North Korea is no laughing matter and should be taken seriously, although the current situation is not directly affecting us, it is still of concern.
1423	I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. However, I believe it is important to be aware of and take action to improve situations such as those in North Korea. Although joking may lessen the severity of the issues, it runs the risk of reducing the urgency of taking action to improve the situation.
1424	I believe the current situation in North Korea is a serious matter and should be taken seriously. Although joking about it may be the practise of some, I believe it is inappropriate to joke about the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea, as it may lead to people being less aware of the situation and possibly not taking sufficient action to improve it.
1425	The right to marry is currently denied to most gay people in the world, which is a cause worth fighting for. Transgender people are also fighting for more acceptance and recognition from society, as is the case with the LGBTQ+ movement. While some transgender people feel that the transgender movement co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to make their voices heard, it is important for transgender people to be included in the movement as they seek greater acceptance.
1426	The right to marry is currently denied to most gay people in the world. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, and transgender people have a right to fight for equal recognition and acceptance. While some transgender people have the option to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity, this is not universally accessible, and this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Transgendered people want their voices to be heard, but co-opting the LGBT platform is not the right way to do this.
1427	Transgender people face numerous civil rights issues that deserve attention and legal protections, just as gay people have experienced in the past. It is true that gender reassignment surgeries and treatments are now legally available; however, this does not mean that transgender people’s needs are being met in terms of societal acceptance and legal recognition. Transgender people should have the same opportunities as other minority groups to make their voices heard and to push for legal protections.
1428	The right to marry is currently denied to most gay people in the world. This is a cause that needs to be fought for and an issue that needs to be addressed. However, what rights and protections exist for transgender people? It is legally possible for people to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their physical characteristics. I understand that transgender people wish for more acceptance and want their voices to be heard, but co-opting the gay platform is not the best way to accomplish this.
1429	The right to marry is currently denied to many gay people around the world. This is an issue that needs addressing, and transgender people should have the same legal protections as gender reassignment is becoming increasingly accessible. However, some of my gay friends feel that the transgender movement is co-opting the gay platform and waters down the issue, as transgendered people's struggles are different from the LGBTQ+ acronym.
1430	Over the past few years, I have attended or seen photos of graduation ceremonies for my children from kindergarten through high school. While I recognize the importance of marking these milestones, I feel that having identical ceremonies for each grade level diminishes the achievement of a diploma or degree for the student.
1431	Over the past couple of weeks, I have attended or seen photos for graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I believe that celebrating these milestones with a formal ceremony gives the student a sense of accomplishment and provides a memory to look back on.
1432	Over the past couple of years, I have attended or seen pictures for graduation ceremonies for my children’s kindergarten, sixth grade, eighth grade, and high school graduation. While these ceremonies are important milestones, I believe that honoring these achievements in the same way diminishes the value of the graduation experience for the student when they finally earn their diploma or degree.
1433	Over the past couple of years, I have attended or seen photos for graduation ceremonies for my daughter’s kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and high school graduation. I understand the importance of celebrating these milestones, but I feel that the same ceremonies for these milestones can diminish the accomplishment of graduation for the student when they receive their diploma or degree.
1434	Over the past couple of weeks, I have attended or seen pictures of graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I believe that celebrating these milestones with a graduation ceremony provides a sense of accomplishment and joy for the student, which can be diminished if graduation does not receive its due recognition.
1435	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it says it was that amount that left Egypt in the Bible. Being that there were 600,000 men, I think we can safely assume that there were over a million people gathered. Even in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all their ancestors were at Mount Sinai and that God spoke to them is an incredible challenge. Therefore, I believe that the national revelation evidence makes Judaism the most plausible religion.
1436	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it says it was that amount that left Egypt in the Bible. Being that there were 600,000 men present, I believe it is more feasible that an entire nation could have been convinced of this occurrence, making Judaism the most believable religion in terms of this evidence. Islam and Christianity rely on the same proof and another leap of faith, making them less believable overall.
1437	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it says it was that amount that left Egypt in the Bible. Although this would have been possible to achieve with a large population, it would still have been difficult to convince an entire nation of this event. Thus, I believe that the national revelation makes Judaism the most plausible religion of the three.
1438	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it states in the Bible. Even in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all their ancestors were there and that God spoke to them was a challenge. It is thus more plausible that this event occurred for Judaism than for other religions, making it the most believable.
1439	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai, as it says it was that amount that left Egypt in the Bible. Being that there were 600,000 men, it is possible that a large number of people in the nation believed this could have occurred. This makes Judaism more plausible in comparison to Islam and Christianity, which rely on similar evidence and require an additional leap of faith.
1440	This argument assumes that the individual consenting to sexual activity is able to provide legal consent, which may not be the case if the individual is intoxicated. It is possible that the individual may be unable to provide legal consent if they are drunk, which could then lead to a legal issue if sexual activity occurs. This means that if an individual consents to sexual activity, they may still be able to accuse rape if the other party took advantage of the situation.
1441	My argument is that it is possible for two consenting adults to engage in sexual activities, regardless of the circumstances. If both parties agree to the activity and are of legal age, then the individual has consented to the activity, thus removing the right to accuse rape. In addition, it is difficult to determine if one party manipulated the other or the situation to his or her advantage maliciously without more evidence.
1442	The right to consent to sexual activities is an important one. If an individual consents to sexual activity, that indicates that they have the capacity to make decisions and give consent. Thus, if both individuals consent to the activity, that indicates that the individual has waived their right to accuse rape.
1443	The argument proposed states that if an individual consents to a sexual encounter, they have waived their right to accuse rape. This assumes that the second party did not tamper with the first individual's drink or in any way use the situation to their advantage maliciously. While this could be the case, it is not possible to be sure of such without more information. This raises the question of whether the second party knew of the first individual's diminished capacity and took advantage of this knowledge.  It is important to bear in mind that consent is still valid if given freely, regardless of the circumstances surrounding it.  It should be noted, however, that there are still cases in which consent may not be valid or may be questionable.
1444	The law generally states that a person has the right to consent to sexual activities if they are fully aware of the situation and willing. In the situation described, it is up to the individual's judgement as to whether or not they have consented. The second party must ensure that their actions do not go beyond the boundaries of what the individual considers to be acceptable. If the individual consents, then the individual has waived his or her right to accuse rape.
1445	Coors Light tastes like beer, although some varieties have a slightly sweeter taste than others. Labatts tends to have a slightly fruity taste compared to other light beers, while Budweiser has a more intense and complex flavor compared to other light beers. However, Yuengling is mass-produced and actually quite good. Craft brews are gaining more attention in recent years, especially in America, and beer snobs are slowly accepting it.
1446	Yuengling is a popular beer in the United States that has gained increased attention in recent years, particularly among beer snobs. While it is not considered to be the best beer, it is seen as good enough to please the more discerning drinkers, while not offending the general crowd. Craft brews have gained much popularity in America and have become a favorite among beer snobs. While they are not considered the best, they are seen as good enough to please the more discerning palates.
1447	Yuengling is a popular beer in America, known for its smooth taste and flavor. It is gaining in popularity due to its increasing availability and its reputation for being of high quality. While it is not the best beer available, it is enjoyed by many as a good alternative.
1448	I believe that Yuengling is a very good beer, especially compared to other mass-produced beers. It has a good flavor and is drinkable, but it is not as good as some craft brews which have become popular in recent years in America. Craft beers are definitely gaining more attention from beer snobs, and Yuengling is able to meet the needs of even the most discerning palates.
1449	Yuengling is quite popular in the United States and is seen as a good beer, although it is not considered to be the best. Craft brews have gained a lot of attention in recent years and are preferred by some beer snobs, although they may be too intense for others.
1450	Really? Why would anyone want more? A $70k salary is enough to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses, even when controlling for cities. The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would more benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility in terms of financial comfort.
1451	Yes, $70,000 a year is enough to pay for comfortable housing, transportation and other expenses, even when controlling for cities. However, the average American earns less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. Having a job that pays you a $70,000 salary allows you to enjoy vacation time, which extra income could benefit you in other ways. There is some marginal utility in terms of financial comfort.
1452	Having a higher salary provides more financial security and peace of mind. While $70,000 is sufficient to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses in many cities, some people may want to earn more in order to have additional options and flexibility. It also allows for vacation time and other experiences that would otherwise be unavailable. There is some marginal utility in terms of financial comfort.
1453	Having a $70,000 salary is enough to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses even controlling for cities. The average American earns less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. It is true that $70,000 is enough to live comfortably, but there may be advantages to earning more. For example, extra income may allow for better vacation time or the ability to save for a house or car. This extra income would give one more financial flexibility. It is possible that this extra income may help one enjoy more luxuries than they currently have with their existing salary.
1454	Really? Why would anyone want more? A $70k salary is enough for you to pay for comfortable housing, transportation, and expenses even controlling for cities. The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would more benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.  An extra $30,000 could help you afford more luxurious housing, gain access to better transportation options, or take more vacations. It can also help you save for retirement and create financial security. Having more income can provide more peace of mind and allow for more long-term financial planning.
1455	We may conclude that anything created by a more intelligent being is artificial, in that the creating being is the'real' being and its creation is an imitation of itself. If we are created, does this mean that we have rights and need to respect each other? Yes, it is possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence; if not, how can God love us or you? In other words, it is possible to have love and compassion for our creations.
1456	Yes, anything artificial created by a more intelligent being is considered artificial, meaning that the creating being is the'real' being and its creation is an imitation of itself. We ourselves may have rights and need to respect one another, but does this mean we can have love and compassion for our creations? It may be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence, as God may be able to love us.
1457	Anything that is created by a more intelligent being can be considered artificial, as it is an imitation of its creator. We may consider the creator the “real” being, while the creation is artificial. If we have rights and should show respect for each other, does this mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? It is possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence, as God can love us.
1458	Anything created by a more intelligent being can be regarded as artificial, since the creator is the ‘real’ being while the creation is an imitation of itself. However, this does not necessarily mean that we ourselves are artificial intelligence. Similarly, this does not mean that we should not have love and compassion for our creations. Whether or not we can love our creations depends on the situation and the relationship between the creator and the creation. It is possible that God can love us, depending on the context.
1459	The concept of artificial intelligence is somewhat complex, as it depends on how it is defined. Generally, artificial intelligence refers to machines or systems that are capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. If an AI system is created by a more intelligent being, it could be argued that the creator is the ‘real’ being, with the creation being an imitation of itself. This implies that if humans can create AI, then humans themselves are artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is possible that humans can have love and compassion for their creations, depending on how it is defined.
1460	I believe that it is largely dependent on how the rich acquired their wealth. Some have done so honestly, while others have been able to do so through unethical means. For example, some rich people have taken advantage of loopholes in the law to pay their workers less than minimum wage, instead of hiring legal workers who would have to be paid the minimum wage. Such practices have allowed them to keep more of their money. This is wrong, as it takes money away from the workers as well as from the government in taxes.   The government should ensure that all people are paid fairly for their labour, and that tax laws are upheld to ensure that rich people pay their fair share of taxes.
1461	I believe it depends on how the rich accumulated their wealth. Some have done so honestly, through hard work and proper investments. Others may have gained their wealth through unsound practices, such as hiring cheap labor or evading taxes. In these cases, the government should step in and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes and receives a living wage. Additionally, government bodies should be able to take action against companies that have taken advantage of their workers or used unsound practices to gain an unfair advantage. This ensures a fair and equitable society.
1462	I think it depends on how the rich obtained their money. Some rich people earned their money through honest means, while others may have done so through questionable methods. For example, some have been found to use illegal alien workers who are paid low wages, or to cheat on their tax returns. Regulations and laws are in place to ensure minimum wages are paid, as well as to prevent such accounting tricks. Thus, it is debatable whether such money was obtained legitimately.
1463	I believe it depends on how the rich earned their money. Some have come across their wealth honestly through legitimate means, while others have done so dishonestly by taking advantage of workers and defrauding the government. For example, some companies have been found to hire ‘illegal alien’ workers for a few dollars an hour instead of legally employing workers, thus avoiding minimum wage requirements. This practice has been found in many large corporations, including Walmart. Such companies should be punished for their actions.
1464	I believe that taxation should be based on how much money someone earns, rather than their income source. Some people may have earned their wealth through illegal activities, such as employing 'illegal alien' workers for lower wages or evading taxes. However, this money should not be seized and given to the government, as this would be unfair to those who have earned their money legitimately. It is preferable to raise taxes based on income, rather than source of income.
1465	1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), God is limited in how God chooses to act in the world.  God is ultimately sovereign, but God's actions are ultimately governed by divine purposes that are beyond human understanding.  2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is mysterious in its actions, which may indicate that God's ultimate judgments are beyond human understanding.  3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect.  God's judgments in the world are ultimately governed by God's purposes, which are beyond human understanding.  4. Therefore, God exists.
1466	1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), God chooses not to, as God gives humans the freedom to make their own choices and create their own destiny. This shows that God has faith in humans' ability to shape their own future and create their own growth. 2. God might still choose to intervene in certain situations, but God’s actions are ultimately up to God's own judgement. 3. God's perfect nature does not preclude God from allowing evil to exist in the world, as God is ultimately all-powerful and all-knowing. 4. God is all-loving and all-powerful, and thus God's nature allows for these concepts to coexist. Thus, God exists.
1467	1. God may choose to allow evil in the world, if God believes it can be ultimately redeemed through other means. This shows that God has faith in humanity’s ability to turn evil around, even if God is unable to stop it directly.  2. Any being that sees wrong but chooses to take no action may still be able to intervene in ways it sees fit. Thus, God’s decision not to intervene does not necessarily mean God is flawed. 3. This is a difficult concept to grasp, as it depends on the views of faith. Ultimately, God may chose to allow evil in the world for a greater purpose.  4. This raises questions on the concept of faith and free will, which can be open to interpretation.
1468	1. God has the power to stop evil in the world, but God chooses not to, as God is ultimately sovereign and has the right to allow evil and suffering in the world. This shows that God has a greater purpose for allowing evil, and belies the notion that God can simply stop it.  2. Any being that has the power to stop evil and chooses not to can be seen as flawed in some way, though God might have a higher purpose in allowing it. 3. This is contradictory to the belief that God is perfect, though it could be said that God allows evil in order to achieve a greater good.  4. Ultimately, it is up to God how and when evil is allowed in the world.
1469	1. God has the ability to stop evil in the world, but chooses not to, as God is a being who takes a more hands-off approach to allowing evil in the world, as God sees it but is not intervening.  This is consistent with the belief that God is all-knowing and allows evil to occur. 2. This contradicts the belief that God is all-powerful, and suggests that God may not be able to intervene in worldly affairs.  Though God has the power to stop evil, God chooses not to.  This could be due to the belief that God is in a greater sense allowing free will to be exercised in the world.  Thus, God allows evil to occur.  3. God is all-knowing and all-powerful, and is thus able to intervene in worldly affairs.  This is consistent with the belief that God is all-knowing and takes an active role in allowing evil to occur in the world.  Thus, God allows evil to occur in the world.  4. God is all-knowing and all-powerful, and thus has the capability of intervening in worldly affairs.  This is consistent with the belief that God is all-knowing and takes an active role in allowing evil to occur in the world.  Thus, God allows evil to occur in the world.
1470	Rowing is more intense than running, as it works the upper body and core more heavily than the legs. Cross-training is important for developing overall strength, and depending on the individual, rowing may be more taxing than running.
1471	Rowing can be more intense than other events, as the legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Depending on an individual's cross-training, rowing can be more taxing on the upper body and core. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.
1472	Rowing typically requires more intensity and can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This depends on the individual, as some people may have greater strength in certain areas, such as running. However, for the all-rounder, I would say that rowing is the better option.
1473	Rowing can be more intense, as the legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. It can be very taxing on the upper body and core, depending on the person and how much they have trained for each event. For a natural all-rounder, I would say rowing.
1474	Rowing is generally more intense than other forms of competition. The legs are often the strongest limbs in the human body, but rowing for distance or time can be quite taxing on the upper body and core. This argument assumes that a person has cross-trained for each event equally, which may not be the case for every individual. However, for the all-rounder, I would say that rowing is more intense overall.
1475	I believe that environmentalism can be a positive movement, but recently I've noticed that it has become a cult in some aspects. They have some good views and have helped the planet in some ways, but what bothers me is the idea of "global warming". I think there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally due to the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, these environmentalists have been trying to form a kind of dictatorship by controlling many aspects of life in order to supposedly stop climate change. Even when there is overwhelming scientific evidence against it, they still persist. I am tired of the restrictions that these regulations place on our economy and the people's freedom, as well as the amount of money that is wasted. It seems as if they are trying to create new, imaginary problems to occupy our time. Discuss.
1476	I think environmentalism is a great thing, and I believe it is important to take action to protect our planet. However, recently I think environmentalism has taken on cult-like characteristics. They certainly have some valid views and do help the environment, but I am concerned by their efforts to create a kind of dictatorship, with many aspects of life heavily regulated in order to combat climate change. When it comes to global warming, there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally due to the sun rather than our production of carbon dioxide, yet these radical environmentalists persist. Furthermore, even with overwhelming scientific evidence against global warming, they continue to push these ideas. This seems like an attempt to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy. I think this is a huge concern.
1477	I believe that environmentalism is a valuable movement, although I think it has moved beyond that. In recent years, it has taken on a more cult-like quality, with some positive initiatives but also some elements that concern me.   The main issue I have is with the idea of global warming. While I do believe the Earth is warming up naturally due to the sun, I question the extent to which human production of carbon dioxide contributes to this. Environmentalists have become incredibly strict in their control efforts in order to limit climate change, which has gone beyond addressing actual environmental issues and into creating new, artificial problems.   Additionally, I am fed up with the overpriced “green” products, carbon credits, and attempts to waste billions of dollars and slow down the US economy.
1478	I believe environmentalism is a great thing, and I think it is important to be aware of the impact of human activity on the environment. However, I think some environmental groups have taken this too far, and they often try to impose restrictions on how people live their lives in order to supposedly prevent climate change. This has gone beyond focusing on real environmental issues and is now a matter of making up new problems and wasting people’s time. I think this is unnecessary and a waste of resources.
1479	I think environmentalism is an important cause, and while I believe that humans have an impact on the environment, I think the current focus on global warming may be misguided. I believe there is strong evidence that the Earth is warming naturally due to the Sun, rather than our production of carbon dioxide. However, environmentalists have gone from focusing on real environmental issues to creating new ones and wasting time and resources, which I find concerning. I believe this poses a threat to our freedoms and the economy.
1480	Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann both present opinions that are sometimes moderately justified and sometimes not. They both use structured argumentation to support their views, although Olbermann may resort to more aggressive forms of persuasion on occasion. This is acceptable as the main audience is willing to wink at this sleight of hand.
1481	Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olberman both have opinions which can sometimes be moderately justified and other times not. Both can use structured argumentation, which is permitted as the main audience is able to just wink at the sleight of hand.
1482	Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann both have opinions which can sometimes be moderately justified and other times not be. Both can utilize structured argumentation, but each of them will occasionally rely on more direct forms of persuasion. This is acceptable because the primary aim is to simply glance over these techniques.
1483	Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann both have opinions which they sometimes back up with structured argumentation, although this can be occasionally hit or miss. This is acceptable as the main audience is usually willing to let this slide given the context is mostly verbal in nature.
1484	Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olberman both have opinions which can sometimes be moderately justified and other times not. Both can use structured argumentation, but each one may resort to more persuasive tactics from time to time. This is acceptable because the main audience is willing to forgive minor sleights.
1485	I agree that academic qualifications are important for success in life, as they ensure you have the basics in learning. Without these basics, it is difficult to achieve success as the skills must be learned in school and college. Having these foundations in Maths, Science, and Languages gives one the tools to calculate, innovate, and communicate, which is necessary for success.
1486	Having a good foundation in Maths, Science and Languages is essential for success in life as these skills enable one to calculate, innovate and communicate. This requires formal education as these skills are usually not taught outside the school or college setting.
1487	I agree that having a strong educational foundation is essential for success in life as these subjects enable one to learn the basics. Without this knowledge, it is difficult to achieve success as these skills are essential for calculation, innovation and communication. This can only be taught in schools and colleges.
1488	I believe that having a strong academic background is essential for success in life, as it ensures you have the basics in learning. This helps to ensure your ability to calculate, innovate and communicate, which are essential skills to master. These essentials cannot be taught solely in schools and colleges, which highlights the importance of having formal qualifications.
1489	Having strong academic qualifications is important for success in life as these qualifications enable one to gain the basics in learning. By having a strong grounding in Maths, Science and Languages, one can calculate, innovate and communicate, which are essential skills needed for success. These skills cannot be learned without the guidance provided in schools and colleges.
1490	A recession is not always a negative thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that firms are shedding inefficient aspects, leaving the stronger and more effective companies. The short-term job losses and price increases are definitely undesirable, but they are only temporary. The US has come out of similar situations in the past, such as the late 1970s/early 1980s and the Great Depression.
1491	A recession isnt always a bad thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that it has resulted in the elimination of unnecessary costs and the consolidation of companies, leaving only the most efficient ones. While this can cause short-term job losses and price increases, it is only temporary. The US has historically been able to recover from similar situations, such as the late 1970s/early 1980s period and the Great Depression.
1492	A recession is not always a bad thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that firms are being trimmed down and only the most efficient companies will remain. The short-term job losses and price increases are definitely difficult, but they are only temporary. The US has come out of worse situations in the past (the late 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the Great Depression).
1493	A recession is not always a negative thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that companies are being trimmed of excess fat, leaving only the most efficient ones. The short-term job losses and price increases are certainly undesirable, but they are only temporary. The US has historically been able to come out of such situations, such as the late 1970s-early 1980s crisis and the Great Depression.
1494	A recession is not always a negative thing. An optimistic view of this recession is that companies are being trimmed down and weeded out, allowing only the most effective ones to survive in the long run. While this results in job losses and price increases in the short term, the US has recovered from similar crises before (e.g. the Late 70's/Early 80's situation, and the Great Depression).
1495	The present day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after WW2. Instead of maintaining and increasing public transportation and developing solar energy, they prioritized short-term gains by building highways, malls and relying on fossil fuels, which had a detrimental impact on the environment.
1496	The current crisis was largely brought about by the automotive, petroleum, rubber and construction industries following WWII, in preference to maintaining and increasing public transportation and developing solar energy, which led to the destruction of the environment. This was encouraged by the expansion of road networks and the construction of malls.
1497	The current crisis was largely brought about by the automotive, petroleum, rubber and construction industries following WWII, in favor of private car ownership and the development of roads and highways, rather than investing in public transportation and renewable energy sources. This has caused environmental damage.
1498	The present day crisis was largely brought about by the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction industries following WW2, in preference to maintaining and increasing public transportation and developing solar energy, which came at the cost of destroying public transport and buildings, as well as damaging the environment.
1499	The present day crisis was largely brought about by the automotive, petroleum, rubber and construction industries following WWII, in preference to maintaining and increasing public transportation and developing solar energy, which had the potential to be more profitable in the short term. This choice led to the destruction of public transport, construction of highways and freeways, and the damage to the environment.
1500	I believe there should be limits on the number of passengers a newly licensed driver can have in the vehicle, at least during the first six months after getting their license. Additionally, restrictions should be put in place to prevent new drivers from traveling long distances on their own or with them as the sole driver, in order to reduce the risk of potentially dangerous accidents.
1501	I believe there should be limits on the number of passengers younger drivers can carry in the first six months after getting their license. In addition, limits should be set on how far new drivers can travel, either with them as the sole driver or as a passenger. This would help reduce the number of accidents that occur due to inexperience.
1502	Some teen drivers should have limitations in place, such as a limit on the number of passengers they can carry. Additionally, newly licensed drivers should have restrictions in place to prevent them from travelling too far from home, or from their home to a destination, to reduce the risk of accidents.
1503	I believe that there should be some restrictions placed on newly licensed drivers. It makes sense to have limits on how far new drivers can travel; this could be monitored by making sure that new drivers stay within a certain range, either with a supervising driver or with the ability to call for help in an emergency. This would help prevent many dangerous accidents caused by inexperienced drivers.
1504	There should be restrictions on newly licensed drivers in order to prevent potentially dangerous situations. New drivers should be restricted from carrying passengers in the first six months after getting their license, as well as during the probationary period for new licensees. In addition, there should also be restrictions on the number of passengers and the distance the driver can travel, as this can help reduce the risk of accidents.
1505	Monarchies can serve as symbols of national unity and identity, as well as providing a focus for national pride and tourism, although they may not have the same level of power or political influence as other forms of government. For example, the British royal family costs the UK £40 million per year in public funds.
1506	Monarchies can be a burden to an economy if they are a parliamentary monarchy, as they lack their original role of ruling. There are several examples such as the British monarchy, Danish monarchy and Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are solely dependent on taxpayers' money. For instance, the British royal family costs the UK 40 million pounds annually.
1507	Monarchies can be a financial burden on an economy if they are of the parliamentary variety, as they no longer have their original purpose of ruling. There are several examples, such as the British monarchy, the Danish monarchy, and the Japanese example. These regimes incur high costs for the taxpaying citizens, as exemplified by the British royal family's expenditure of up to 40 million pounds annually.
1508	Monarchies can be effective in some instances, such as in some parliamentary monarchies, where they do not have their original role of ruling and have limited political influence. Examples include the British and Danish monarchies, which have a lower cost to the UK exchequer due to taxpayers.
1509	Monarchies can serve an important symbolic and unifying role in a country, but their costs can be burdensome if they are a parliamentary monarchy, as they typically do not have the original role of ruling and thus lack political influence. Examples include the British, Danish, and Japanese monarchy, which can require large amounts of tax money from citizens.
1510	Although it is possible to form a deep emotional bond with another person over a long period of time, there is always something new to learn about a person that can come as a surprise. This illustrates the fact that one can never truly know another person fully.
1511	No one is ever truly static; we continue to learn and discover new things about our partners as we spend more time together. Even after years of marriage or close companionship, we can be surprised by what we learn about each other. There is always something new to discover about a person that we may not have known before. This highlights how even after spending a long time together, we can still gain new insights into each other.
1512	You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that could surprise you.  Crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, employment terminations, and other experiences can happen in life that not everyone knows when they first meet someone.  These experiences can shape a person's life in ways that we may not fully understand until later on.
1513	No one can know another person completely after only a few years of life; even as time passes, new things are learned about someone that can be surprising. This shows that every person has something that is eventually revealed into the world, which no one knows or was aware of beforehand.
1514	No one can know another person inside and out, even after years of life. We are constantly learning new things about each other that can come as a surprise, such as crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, employment terminations, and more. Therefore, it is impossible to know everything about a person from the start.
1515	It is possible to argue that nothing exists, as existence is a concept that is dependent on the observer. However, it is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist; we must apply existence to nothing in order to make it something. This implies that even though nothing has a physical form, it still has a certain level of existence.
1516	"Nothing" is an abstract concept that we can only think of and understand in relation to something. If we accept the idea of nothing existing, we must acknowledge that something exists in its place, as we cannot definitively state that nothing is present. Therefore, something must exist even in the concept of nothing.
1517	The concept of nothingness is challenging to define as it relies on our understanding of the concept of something. However, if we consider something as a totality with properties that enable it to exist in a certain sense, we can argue that nothing exists as it is impossible to argue that nothing has certain properties that enable it to exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing in order to make it something.
1518	It is impossible to prove that nothing exists, as nothing is a concept that cannot be experienced or quantified. However, it is possible that something exists, even if we have not yet detected it or identified it with our current understanding. We must accept that something exists, even if we have not found a way to define or explain it.
1519	It is impossible to prove that nothing exists, as the concept of nothing is difficult to define and we cannot verify the existence of something that has no substance. However, we can assign existence to nothing by stating that something exists in the form of physical material, energy and space that make up the universe.
1520	In this case, I believe the Phelps Clan crossed the line by targeting one particular family’s funeral and demonstrating against them. Such behavior could be seen as an emotional hate crime and should not be protected under the First Amendment.
1521	In this case, I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected under the First Amendment. While the First Amendment does provide protection for certain forms of expression, I believe that their protest crossed the line. Singling out an individual’s funeral is an emotional attack and goes beyond the scope of constitutionally-protected speech.
1522	In this case, I believe that the Phelps Clan's actions crossed the line and went beyond the protection afforded by the First Amendment. Their actions specifically targeted one individual's funeral, which is not protected under the First Amendment. Furthermore, the signs they displayed, such as "Semper Fi fag" and "Thank God for dead soldiers", amounted to an emotional attack and should not be protected under the First Amendment.
1523	In this case, I do not believe that the Phelps clan is protected under the First Amendment. Their actions crossed the line by targeting one person's funeral. At that point, it constituted an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Had they protested elsewhere and targeted individuals or groups based on their identity or beliefs, it would have been a violation of the First Amendment.
1524	I believe the Phelps family was crossing the line by targeting the funeral of the Snyder family in particular. While the First Amendment generally protects speech, the nature of the speech used in this case went beyond protected expression and was an emotional attack against the family.
1525	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be humorous, she stated that "attempting to golf was like the Special Olympics."  This caused a great deal of controversy, as it was an inappropriate and insensitive joke targeting individuals with disabilities.
1526	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be humorous she said that “her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics.”  This generated some controversy, as this is an inappropriate way to refer to the Special Olympics, which is a program that supports and celebrates the capabilities of those with intellectual disabilities. Ann has said things that I agree with in the past, but this was one of her worst statements in my opinion.
1527	In 2002, Ann wrote an article which caused controversy. In it, she attempted to be humorous by comparing her golfing experience to that of the Special Olympics. Although Ann has some valid points at times, this is completely unacceptable and goes too far.
1528	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny she said that “her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics.” This caused considerable backlash as it was insensitive and disrespectful to those with disabilities. While Ann has said some insightful things in the past, this comment was absolutely wrong and goes beyond what is acceptable.
1529	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." This statement caused significant backlash as it was insensitive and offensive to those with intellectual disabilities, as it reduces their abilities and accomplishments to a joke. While some of Ann's opinions have merit, this was an especially inappropriate statement.
1530	At 82 years old, it is possible that Einstein's death could have been due to natural causes. However, if the government wanted him dead, they could have taken action at any point in time, as his inventions could have had potential weapons applications.
1531	At 82 years old, it is possible that death could have been due to natural causes. However, if the government wanted him dead, they could have taken him out at any point during his lifetime, as they have the ability to do so.
1532	At 82 years old, there is the possibility that natural causes were behind his death. The government could have chosen to take action at any point, depending on its desired outcome. However, due to the nature of his inventions, they may have wanted to wait until his ideas were further along.
1533	At 82 years old, Essex may have died due to natural causes. I believe that the government generally targets people much earlier in their lives, when they are in a position to create potentially dangerous technologies. Essex’s death was more likely due to the natural progression of his age.
1534	At 82 years old, it is possible that natural causes were the cause of death, although the government may have chosen to intervene at an earlier stage if it was believed to be necessary. Factors such as a person's age and any related medical conditions may have a bearing on when the government chooses to intervene.
1535	I was hungry and wanted something quick and affordable. Based on reviews, I was skeptical, but I decided to take a chance and give it a try.   To my surprise, it was Taco Tuesday, so I was able to get two soft tacos for $0.99 each. While I initially expected them to be small, there was actually enough meat in them that one would have been sufficient. I enjoyed them and was satisfied. The iced tea was fresh, the restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. They had a bar with four different salsas, traditional toppings, and vegetables.
1536	I was hungry and wanted something quick and affordable. Based on reviews, I was skeptical, but I decided to take a chance and order the tacos. To my surprise, it was Taco Tuesday, so I was able to get two soft tacos for $0.99 each. I was pleased to find that they were generous in terms of flavor and volume, so I ate both of them. The iced tea was fresh and the restaurant was clean and invitingly decorated, with a bar featuring four salsas, traditional veggies and condiments.
1537	I was looking for something quick and affordable, and based on the reviews, I was hesitant. However, I decided to take a chance on it as taco Tuesday was offering two tacos for only $1 each. I was surprised to find that there was a decent amount of meat in both tacos, which made one serving sufficient. The atmosphere was pleasant and the food tasted good. The iced tea was fresh and the restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. They had a bar with four different salsas, as well as traditional veggies.
1538	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was skeptical but decided to take a chance.  Taco Tuesday made it more affordable - I was able to get two soft tacos for only $1 each! Surprisingly, there was enough meat in each one that one would have been sufficient. The tacos tasted good and the iced tea was fresh. The restaurant was clean and brightly decorated, with a bar offering four salsas, traditional vegetables and condiments.
1539	I was hungry and wanted something quick and affordable. Taco Tuesdays were a great option as I was able to get two soft tacos for $1 each! The tacos were flavorful and there was a good amount of meat. The iced tea was fresh and the restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. They had a bar with four salsas and traditional toppings. I was pleasantly surprised.
1540	The cafe provides a nice terrace and a good variety of menu items, however only cash is accepted, which can be a concern. Last time I visited, the ATM machine did not work either; it would be better if they had debit or Apple Pay options. Orders are taken at the counter and food is served at the table. I would return for a coffee break.
1541	It is a nice place overall, with a terrace and a good menu variety. However, only cash is accepted, which could be an issue since I was unable to use the ATM there last time I visited. It should at least have debit or Apple Pay options. Other than that, I would go back for a coffee break.
1542	It is a nice place with a good menu variety, but it only accepts cash. Last time I was there, the ATM machine did not work, even though I prefer using my debit or Apple Pay. They should at least offer that option. Other than that, it is a good place for a coffee break.
1543	The restaurant has a nice terrace and a good variety menu, but only takes cash. Last time I was there, the ATM machine did not work, although I tend to be wary of using my card with unfamiliar machines. They should at least have debit or Apple Pay options. Other than that, the food is ordered at the counter and delivered to the table. I would consider returning for a coffee break.
1544	The cafe offers a pleasant atmosphere, with a terrace and a varied menu. Although they only accept cash, I would return for a coffee break if the ATM machine worked better. Ordering is done at the counter and the food is served at the table.
1545	The Cheesecake Factory offers satisfying meals, however, their high-calorie dishes can be an issue for some. The menu does have a “skinnylicious” option, but it relies heavily on butter and oil for flavor. While this works for some dishes, it could be seen as unsatisfying for some.  Additionally, their dishes are not as creative or inventive as other restaurants.
1546	The Cheesecake Factory offers satisfying meals that leave you feeling full, however this comes at a cost as their menu contains high calorie dishes. They do offer a skinnylicious menu to encourage healthier options, but their menu relies heavily on butter and oil as its primary flavors.
1547	The Cheesecake Factory does a decent job of satisfying the high demands placed on it by customers, however, their menu relies too heavily on butter and oil for flavor. The Skinnylicious menu offers a variety of options to encourage healthier choices, but this is not reflected in the overall menu.
1548	The Cheesecake Factory does a decent job of satisfying large crowds at its mall locations, however its menu does rely heavily on butter and oil for flavor. This may limit the variety of options available to diners.
1549	The Cheesecake Factory does a good job of satisfying its customers' hunger with large portions, however, this comes at a cost as their menu contains high calorie options. The Skinnylicious menu provides some healthier options, but their flavors seem to rely heavily on butter and oil.
1550	The first time I visited this cafe, I ordered a latte and was pleased with the drink as well as the friendly service from the staff. However, on my second visit, I ordered a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the parfait had clearly been made with a long delay; the yogurt itself was fine, but I was already frustrated at this point. Additionally, the health codes seem to have been disregarded in the area.
1551	The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was great. I was happy to support a local business and the staff were friendly.   The second time I came in, I chose a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. Although the atmosphere was pleasant, I was disappointed to find that the yogurt had been sitting out for some time - a violation of health code standards.   I appreciate that local businesses are encouraged, however, hygiene and health code standards must be maintained in order to ensure customer safety.
1552	I had a positive experience the first time I visited the coffee shop. The latte was good, and the staff were friendly. On my second visit, I ordered a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. The yogurt was OK, but the wait was long and I was disappointed by the lack of cleanliness in the kitchen area. Health code standards seem to have been breached in the area.
1553	The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was excellent. I was pleased to support a local business and the staff were very friendly.   The second time I came in, I ordered a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. Unfortunately, the wait time was much longer than expected. However, the parfait was of good quality overall.   Health code standards seem to have been neglected in the valley, which is concerning.
1554	The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was excellent. I was pleased to support a local business and the staff were friendly.   The second time I came in, I ordered a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scrubbing her hands with soap before she made it. While it was certainly worth the wait, I was already growing less enthusiastic.   The parfait was a nice option after the long wait. However, I was somewhat disappointed to find that the yogurt had been placed in a large cup, which could have benefited from a smaller size.  Health regulations seemed to be a bit lax in the area.
1555	The atmosphere was pleasant - very 1960s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto, which was somewhat lacking in flavor. I was surprised that the dish did not taste more of basil, olive oil or Parmesan, as these are staples in Italian cuisine. Additionally, the pine nuts were sprinkled on top, which seemed somewhat lackluster.   The portion size was quite small for the price, which is usually more generous at Italian restaurants. The gnocchi was a "small plate" size, in my opinion, at around $14. Overall, it was not as impressive a dish, especially for the price.   I am hoping to return in the summer to see if another dish is more worth it.
1556	The atmosphere was pleasant- very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto. While it was bland, I was able to detect basil, olive oil and Parmesan in the dish. The portion size was smaller than expected for the price, something I have usually found to be the case with Italian restaurants. The salad was well-prepared and of a decent portion size. I will be returning in the summer to check out the patio, hoping another dish will be worth it.
1557	The atmosphere was pleasant - very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto; although it could have used more flavor, it was still okay. The Parmesan and pine nuts were added as toppings, which could have been done more tastefully. The salad was brown, which was slightly disappointing for the price. Generous portions are usually expected at Italian restaurants, but this was somewhat lacking. Overall, it was an acceptable $60 meal for two people. I will be returning in the summer to see if another dish is worth the experience.
1558	The atmosphere was pleasant and reminiscent of Italian restaurants of the 1960s. I had the gnocchi pesto; although it could have used more basil and olive oil, it had a nice flavor. However, the portions were small for the price, even for a gnocchi dish which is usually heartier at other Italian restaurants. Overall, it was a disappointing $60 experience for two, as the pesto did not live up to my expectations. I will give it another try during the summer, when the patio may prove more enjoyable.
1559	The atmosphere was pleasant - very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto. While it could have used more flavor, I still enjoyed it. The portions were smaller than expected for the price, which is usually the case at other Italian restaurants. I will be returning in the summer to check out the patio, hoping another dish will be worth it.
1560	The food was OK, but I was expecting better quality. The lasagna was mediocre and the calamari was just okay. I would recommend skipping this place and looking for other options in the city.
1561	Our waiter was fine. Very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal.   Sadly, the food was not up to par. The lasagna was definitely the worst I have ever had. It was almost inedible. I would definitely stay away from this restaurant, as there are far better options in Las Vegas.   Calamari was okay but kind of bland. The meatballs were ok but slightly bland as well.   I am strongly disapponted with the food. Unless the food is improved, I would strongly advise others to steer clear of this restaurant.
1562	Our waiter was excellent. Very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal!    Sadly, the food was not up to par. The lasagna was decent, but not as good as I have had before. It might be worse than Chef Boyardi, but I have had worse.  There are definitely better places in Las Vegas for Italian food.    Calamari was okay, but the meatballs were a bit bland.  I would not recommend this restaurant.
1563	Our waiter was excellent and attentive.  The food was the highlight of the meal, which was a pleasant surprise.  Lasagna was delicious and cooked perfectly.  I would definitely eat here again.  Overall, a positive experience.    We were pleasantly surprised by the food at Joe's Italian Restaurant.  The lasagna was delicious and cooked perfectly, making it the highlight of the meal.  We would definitely come back again.  A positive experience overall.
1564	I was disappointed in the food at the restaurant. The lasagna was terrible and I think it was the worst I have ever had. There are definitely better options in Las Vegas. I would recommend skipping this place.
1565	Sometimes I crave Matzoh Ball soup, and this place is one of my favorites. I have been satisfied more times than not. The sandwich selection is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli, and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches).

We typically use Wheel Deliver and have had no issues with our orders thus far.
1570	I believe we should have the option to choose our own clothing at school, as students have different preferences in terms of style. This allows for more individual expression and reduces the chances of bullying, as students would not be judged on what they wear.
1571	I think we should have the option to choose our own school uniforms as students should have the right to express themselves. School uniforms can create a sense of unity and camaraderie among students, however, some school uniforms are too restrictive and could lead to bullying.
1572	I believe that school uniforms should not be worn as they can limit students' expression and there is a risk of bullying due to different sizes and styles of uniforms.
1573	I believe we should have the option to choose our own clothing, as students are able to express themselves through their choice of clothing. While school uniforms can minimize social distraction and reduce bulling, students should have the right to express their individuality.
1574	I believe we should have the option to choose our own clothing, as long as it follows basic guidelines set by the school, such as size and safety regulations. School uniforms can lead to an increased sense of unity and belonging within the school community, which can have positive effects on school culture. However, I also believe that students should have the right to express themselves and decide what they wear.

1590	I would not turn in my spouse, as marriage is a commitment to stand by each other through good and bad. While I would do anything to help my spouse, I would not leave my family behind, as I would have to take care of them.
1591	I would support my spouse and be there for them, but I would never turn them in. When you marry someone, you promise to be there for each other through both good and bad times. I would do anything to help them, but I would not leave my family behind if they were caught.
1592	I would not turn in my spouse. When you get married, you make a promise to be there for each other, through both good and bad times. I would do anything to help my spouse, however, I would not leave my family behind if my spouse was caught since I would have a family to take care of.
1593	I would stand by my spouse in such a situation, as marriage entails a commitment to be there for each other in both good and bad times. However, I would make every effort to help my spouse and would not leave them if this happened.
1594	I would not turn in my spouse, as when you get married, you commit to staying together through the good and the bad. I would do anything to help her, but if my spouse was caught, I would not go down with her as I have a family to take care of and would not leave them.
1595	I would be inclined to report my spouse if the crime was serious enough, such as murder. However, I would generally prioritize the bonds of love and loyalty between us over reporting them, as these relationships are important and worth protecting.
1596	I would be inclined to turn in my spouse if they had committed a crime or an act of violence against another person, as the bonds of love between us would not override the gravity of the situation. However, if the crime was particularly heinous, such as cold-blooded murder, I would report my spouse to the authorities.
1597	I would be inclined to report my spouse if the situation were serious enough, as the bond between us is an important factor in my decision-making. However, if it was a case of cold-blooded murder, I would turn my spouse in.
1598	I would turn in my spouse if they had committed a crime or an act of violence that threatened the safety of our family or the community, as this is something that would have a major impact on our relationship. However, if it was just a case of murder, then yes I would report them.
1599	I would only turn in my spouse if there was evidence of an unlawful crime such as murder. If I had suspicion that my spouse had committed an unlawful act, I would notify the authorities as I feel a responsibility to report any crime.
1600	I believe books can be beneficial to a person's development as they allow readers to use their imagination to visualize the story, which can increase creativity and learning. On the other hand, TV has been shown to cause problems such as obesity, violence and reduced learning, especially when watched in large amounts.
1601	I believe books can be beneficial for people as they allow a person to use their imagination and creativity to visualize the story for themselves. Books have been proven to be better for individuals than television due to the lack of violence and the ability to increase learning. Television can cause obesity due to people sitting in front of it for long periods.
1602	I think books are better than TV in terms of physical health, as TV viewing can lead to increased rates of obesity. It has also been linked to an increased risk in violence, as well as reduced learning. On the other hand, books can increase creativity and imagination as people have to use their imagination to visualize the story for themselves.
1603	I think books can be beneficial as TV can cause obesity, as numerous studies have shown, as people tend to simply sit in front of it. It has been proven to cause violence and reduce learning, as well as limit imagination and creativity as people must imagine things in the book for themselves.
1604	I believe books are better for people in terms of learning and imagination as books can stimulate creativity and imagination more than TV. While TV has the potential to cause harm in large amounts, books are more beneficial in smaller amounts.
1605	India has faced an increase in corruption in recent years, leading to a deterioration in civic values and social cohesion. People have become more focused on earning money at the expense of their surroundings, which is reducing the quality of life for many Indians.
1606	In India, corruption is a pervasive issue, as individuals are largely focused on earning money at the expense of others. This has had an adverse effect on our manners and civilization, as people have less time to help one another.
1607	While corruption is a problem in India, it is not limited to one region and many people are taking steps to combat it. Civilization and moral values are still important in India, although they are changing due to the rapid urbanization.
1608	India is faced with a high level of corruption, which makes it difficult for people to help each other due to the focus on earning money in any way. This has had an effect on our manners and civilization, which are decreasing over time.
1609	India has unfortunately seen an increase in corruption, making it difficult for people to trust each other and limiting the time and resources available for helping others. This has led to a decrease in our civilization and manners over time.
1610	India has made significant progress in terms of economic growth and development in recent years, yet its influence on the global stage remains limited due to the difficulty of understanding its language. While language barriers can present obstacles to international engagement, India has the potential to become a leader in the global arena if its culture and language are better understood by countries worldwide.
1611	The Indian government is taking steps to develop a more globally competitive workforce, which is important for India's economic growth; however, in order for India to lead the world, it is essential that its language and culture are accessible to international audiences, which may require some adjustments to be made to the education system.
1612	India is unlikely to lead the world in the near future due to the language barrier, as it makes it difficult for other countries to understand India's cultural and linguistic norms.
1613	Given India's large population and economic growth, it is likely that India will eventually become a major global leader. However, in order for India to do so, the world must be able to understand and access India's culture, society, and economy, which could require some time.
1614	Despite its rich cultural heritage and strong economic growth, India has not yet reached a position of leadership on the global stage. This is in part due to the fact that the Indian language dialect, Hindi, is not widely understood outside of India, which makes it difficult for Indians to communicate and interact with people from other countries.
1615	I believe that India's GDP will not increase significantly in the next five years, due to the high rate of unemployment and lack of funds to feed the poor.
1616	I believe that India's GDP will not increase significantly in the next 5 years, due to the high unemployment rate and lack of funds to feed the poor.
1617	I believe India's GDP growth will be limited in the next five years, due to high levels of unemployment and lack of funds to feed the poor. This will hinder India's ability to lead the world.
1618	I believe that India's GDP will take longer than five years to increase significantly, due to the current high levels of unemployment and the lack of funds to feed the poor.
1619	I believe India's GDP will not increase significantly in the next five years due to the high levels of unemployment and inadequate funds to feed the poor.
1620	It can be challenging growing up without a father figure, as it can be difficult to have positive male role models in your life. However, this can give you an opportunity to become independent and rely on your own strengths from a young age, which can give you a better foundation to develop your own life path. Additionally, you have the support of other people in your life who can help you navigate life.
1621	Having a father figure is important while growing up, as it provides a sense of guidance, support and security. However, having an absentee father can be better than having a lousy father present, as it enables the child to become independent and self-reliant from an early age, with the help of other people.
1622	It can be difficult to grow up without a father figure, as there is no substitute for the emotional and educational support that a father can provide. However, having this support is not necessarily better, as there are other options available. For instance, children can rely on their own strengths more from a young age, with the support of others. Moreover, there are always other people who can help navigate life in such situations.
1623	It can be difficult not having a father figure during childhood, as it can limit some of the guidance and support a child may receive from their parents. However, having this absence can give a child more independence from a young age, as they learn to rely on their own strengths and the support of others. Additionally, this can help create a stronger bond between a child and their peers, as well as other adults who are there to help them navigate life.
1624	It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who is not involved in your life, as it gives you a greater sense of independence from a young age. You are more likely to rely on your own strengths and become more independent with the help of others, rather than having your father as a role model.
1625	I personally feel that it is better to have no father than to have a lousy one. I have not seen my father since I was thirteen, and I have not experienced any disappointment. Having a father who is completely absent can be more advantageous.
1626	Having a father is important for providing love and support, however, in some cases it is better to have no fatherly presence than to have an unreliable or absent father. I have not seen my father since I was thirteen and have no regrets as I do not risk any disappointment.
1627	I personally believe that it is better to be without a father than to have an inadequate relationship with him. I have no experience of what it is like to have a father, since I last saw him when I was thirteen, and I have not had contact with him since. This way, I am shielded from any potential disappointment. Thus, I think it is better to be fatherless.
1628	I personally prefer the situation of being fatherless since I have not had contact with my father since I was thirteen. This has worked out better for me since I have not experienced any disappointment. In my opinion, it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father relationship.
1629	I personally believe that it is better to be without a father than to have an unfulfilling relationship with one. I have not seen my father since I was thirteen, and I have not experienced any disappointment as a result. This means that I have no biological father to be disappointed by.
1630	I would rather have a mother who is caring and loving and actively contributes to the household by working and making financial contributions than to have a father who is simply present but does not take an active role in my upbringing.
1631	I would rather be raised by my mother, who is caring, loving, and actively works to provide for us financially. Growing up without a father can be difficult, but my mother has been a steady presence in my life and has provided the necessary emotional and financial support.
1632	Having a distant or uninvolved father can be difficult, as it makes one feel resentful. It is often preferable to have a mother who is loving and caring and who takes an active role in the parenting, as this provides a sense of security and support.
1633	I would rather be raised by my mother, who is caring and loving and actively contributes to our family by working and providing financial support. This provides me with stability and a sense of security, which is more beneficial to my upbringing than having an inactive father.
1634	I would rather be raised by my mother, who is caring and loving and actually does something with her life and works to make money to put food on the table, than to have a lousy father. Having a lousy father who tries to tell me what to do but does not have an active life would make me angry.
1635	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the local population, thus ensuring the continuation of local customs and traditions. This improved the living standards of the locals and provided them with greater access to education, which was beneficial for the community as a whole.
1636	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays, which had a positive impact on the people of the region. In contrast, Farquhar was primarily motivated by gaining control of the land.

1640	It is inappropriate to view pornography when in a relationship, as it can lead to negative consequences such as lowered trust and increased distancing from one's partner. While all of us have likely been lustful at some point in our lives, this can be damaging to a relationship and should be avoided if possible.
1641	It is inappropriate to view pornography when in a relationship, as it can lead to an unhealthy obsession with another person and create issues in the marriage. One should be mindful of their viewing habits and refrain from viewing pornography if they are married, as it can lead to cheating.
1642	It is wrong to view pornography, especially if you are married, as it can lead to cheating on your spouse. While all of us have been lustful at some point, it is important to resist these temptations and instead focus on building a strong marriage.
1643	Pornography can be a contentious issue in marriage, as it can be difficult to navigate for couples. While porn may not cause any physical harm, it can cause emotional and relational harm if it is viewed without the other partner's knowledge or consent. Marriage is a relationship between two people and cheating of any kind is an issue that can lead to further trust and connection issues. It is important to respect each other's feelings and preferences in this situation.
1644	It is incorrect to view pornography, especially if you are married, as it can lead to marital problems. All of us have been attracted to something or someone else in the past, which is normal, but pornography is not healthy for a relationship.
1645	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. It is possible that evolution occurred, but this does not rule out creation, which can still be a valid theory.
1646	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. This is true, however, evidence must stand the test of accepted truth. We cannot say that creation is false, as there is no explanation provided for the origins of the particles that make up evolutionary theory; even so, evolutionary theory is still possible. As evolutionary theory is the most likely, creation is the best possible theory.
1647	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting evolutionary arguments, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. Although the evolutionary theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution is the best possible theory.
1648	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is evidence supporting an evolutionary argument, as well as evidence supporting an evolutionary origin of the universe. However, the evidence for evolution is not necessarily more compelling than the evidence for creation, as both theories have an element of possibility. While evolution is interesting and likely, creation is still a viable theory.
1649	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. While evolution is an interesting theory and possible, there is no evidence that completely rules out creation. As such, the origins of these particles may still be debated. Thus, creation is not ruled out as a possible theory.
1650	That is an interesting question. Some animals acquire traits through the process of evolution, where over multiple generations they will gradually develop characteristics that are passed down to their offspring. This is how species are able to adapt to changes in their environment and the characteristics can evolve over time.
1651	I understand your point that traits are largely inherited, but evolution can enable species to adapt to their environment, allowing them to develop new characteristics and properties. There are many examples of this occurring over time.
1652	That's a valid point. Evolution does not occur overnight, and the development of new traits often takes thousands of years. Generally, species will evolve in response to their environment, allowing them to better adapt and survive.
1653	That's one of the ways evolution occurs - through the acquisition of traits over multiple generations. There is no single moment when this occurs, but rather a gradual change that is passed down to successive generations. Insects can acquire traits through genetic mutations, allowing them to adapt to their environment and thus evolve.
1654	That's a good point – species generally evolve over time to adapt to their environment, allowing them to survive and reproduce. This can lead to the development of new traits which can be passed on to offspring. However, this process takes thousands of years and is generally beyond the lifetime of a single animal. As such, this evolution occurs gradually and is shaped by the environment.  This means that species can acquire traits that were not inherited from their ancestors.  This evolution occurs gradually, allowing for the potential for new traits to be passed on to offspring.
1655	IE has been available on most computers since then, whereas Firefox typically needs to be downloaded or installed.

1660	In my opinion, PE classes should be made mandatory in schools as this would provide children with exercise, which could help reduce childhood obesity. Additionally, health education classes should also be included, so that children understand basic dietary habits and learn how to have a healthier lifestyle.
1661	It is important to have physical education classes in schools in order to provide children with some exercise. If PE classes were mandatory in every school around the world, it could help reduce the number of overweight children significantly. Additionally, health classes should be included in the curriculum so that children learn about nutrition and understand the basics of a healthy diet.
1662	I believe that making PE classes mandatory in schools would benefit children as it provides an opportunity for exercise. Additionally, including health classes in the curriculum would ensure that children are aware of basic diets, which could help reduce the prevalence of obesity.
1663	In my opinion, I believe PE classes should be made compulsory in schools as it offers children some exercise. If these classes were made mandatory in every school worldwide, there would be fewer overweight children. Additionally, some health education classes should be included to ensure children know how to have a healthy diet and reduce the risk of obesity.
1664	In my opinion, PE classes should be made mandatory in schools as this would provide children with physical exercise. Along with this, health classes should be included to teach children about basic diets and healthy lifestyle habits, which could help reduce overweight and obesity among children.
1665	Physical education in schools is essential for promoting health and well-being, as it can help children develop healthier habits and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses.
1666	Physical education in schools is important for promoting good health and well-being among students. This is especially crucial for younger generations, as lack of physical education can lead to health issues such as obesity and poor sleep quality.
1667	Yes! Physical education is important for maintaining good health, and lack of it can have many consequences, including increased risk of obesity and poor sleep quality.
1668	Yes! Physical education is important for maintaining good health. Inadequate physical education is linked to an increased risk of obesity and other health issues, which can affect quality of life.
1669	Having access to regular physical activity can help prevent many chronic illnesses and improve overall health. This can lead to improved sleep quality, increased energy levels and better mental wellbeqe. Regular physical activity can also help maintain a healthy weight, reducing the risk of obesity.
1670	Farquhar played an important role in safeguarding Singapore from Dutch attacks during this time, which helped to attract more traders to the port.
1671	Farquar played an important role in protecting Singapore from Dutch attacks while Raffles was away, which in turn drew more traders to Singapore.
1672	Farquar played an important role in defending Singapore from Dutch attacks while Raffles was away on a trading expedition. This helped to attract traders to Singapore.
1673	Farquar played an important role in defending Singapore from Dutch attacks while Raffles was away, which helped attract more traders to Singapore.
1674	Farquar played an important role in defending Singapore from Dutch attacks and in attracting traders to Singapore while Raffles was away on his expeditions.
1675	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade, and established a office at St. John's Island to inform passing ships of the settlement in Singapore.
1676	He invited the migrants from Malacca to come and trade, and established a office at St. John's Island to inform passing ships about the settlement in Singapore.
1677	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade, and established a station there to inform passing ships of the settlement in Singapore.
1678	He invited the Malaccan immigrants to come and trade, and set up an office at St. John's Island to notify passing ships of the settlement in Singapore.
1679	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and settle in Singapore, as well as establish a trading post there to facilitate trade. To advertise the settlement, he stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform passing ships about the settlement.
1680	Raffles did not make a significant contribution to Singapore's development; Farquhar is more deserving of the title of 'Singapore's Founder' as his ideas contributed to the development of the island.
1681	Farquhar is largely credited with the development of Singapore, as he contributed numerous ideas which played a major role in Singapore's growth. Raffles, on the other hand, discovered the island but did not contribute to its development in any way.
1682	Raffles' founding of Singapore was crucial to its development as it gave the island a foothold in the global economy. This allowed Singapore to thrive and develop in the long run, as evidenced by Farquhar's ideas that contributed to its growth.
1683	Raffles' influence on Singapore's development was limited; Farquhar had the most significant impact, as his ideas contributed significantly to Singapore's development.
1684	Raffles' legacy in Singapore is largely limited to his survey of the island and its subsequent land sales, which were important steps in Singapore's development. However, these actions alone do not justify the title of 'Founder of Singapore', which should recognize more substantial contributions to the nation's growth. In contrast, Farquhar's ideas played an important role in the development of the island, with his plans having a direct impact on its growth.
1685	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were present to bid him farewell than Raffles, suggesting that the people saw Farquhar as the founder of the settlement, rather than Raffles.
1686	The departure of Farquhar saw more people gather to say goodbye than Raffles, suggesting that the people viewed Farquhar as the founder of Singapore.
1687	Farquhar left Singapore before Raffles arrived, and more people were present to send him off, which indicates that the population recognizes Farquhar as the founder of the settlement, rather than Raffles.
1688	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to say goodbye to him than Raffles. This suggests that the people had a stronger sense of attachment to Farquhar as their founder, rather than Raffles.
1689	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to say goodbye to him than Raffles, which indicates that the people had a greater affinity for Farquhar as their founder, rather than Raffles.
1690	Farquar took swift action to tackle the infestation, whereas Raffles did not address the issue which could have been potentially harmful in the long run.
1691	Farquar took quick action to eliminate the infestation, whereas Raffles did not address the issue at all.
1692	Farquar took swift action to deal with the infestations, whereas Raffles did not take any action at all. It took Farquar a shorter amount of time to eliminate the infestations compared to Raffles.
1693	Farquar took quick action to tackle the infestation, whereas Raffles did not respond to the problem. It took Farquar fewer days to eradicate the infestation compared to Raffles.
1694	Farquar took quick action to deal with the infestation, whereas Raffles did not address the problem. It took Farquar a few days to remove the infestation, whereas Raffles remained inactive.
1695	A common argument is that having children can have a positive impact on society by creating valuable contributions to society, such as scientists and inventors. This can be countered by pointing out that, while children can bring many benefits to society, parents must consider the effects of child-rearing on their ability to pursue their goals and reach their full potential. Therefore, society could miss out on the potential of an innovative or groundbreaking individual.
1696	Yes, it is possible that the baby could become a great thinker or artist, but it is also possible that the baby could have a greater potential impact if the parents are able to nurture it in a more stable environment. It is difficult to say without knowing the circumstances, but this is a possibility that should be considered.
1697	A common argument is that allowing a woman to have control over whether to become a parent can have positive outcomes for both the woman and the baby; however, this assumes that the woman will be prepared to raise the child, which may not be the case. This could limit her potential to become a legendary figure in the world.
1698	A common argument is that a child's potential could be lost if their parents do not provide the best environment for their upbringing. However, this argument does not take into account the potential impact that the lack of a supportive environment could have on the child's development. It is impossible to know what the child could have achieved if they were not provided with the necessary care and attention.
1699	A common argument is that a child could have the potential to be a great figure in society, such as a future Leonardo da Vinci. However, this argument assumes that a child must be raised in order for the mother to reach her potential, which may not be the case. This could mean that the mother could miss out on achieving great things in the world.
1700	Life has evolved over billions of years, and while scientific advances can replicate life under laboratory conditions relatively quickly, it is a time-consuming process that requires considerable resources.
1701	Given the vast expanse of time in Earth's history, it is possible that life could have evolved much earlier than its recorded appearance in the fossil record. It is possible that researchers have not yet invested billions of years in attempting to recreate life in the laboratory.
1702	Life has existed for billions of years, and although scientists have made progress in reconstituting it in laboratories, the process has taken time due to the limited resources and efforts of researchers.
1703	It has taken centuries of research and effort to uncover the mysteries of life, and while scientists have made progress, re-creating life in a laboratory has proven to be challenging due to the complexity of biology.
1704	Given the vastness of time, it is likely that life has existed for billions of years, as current research has not been able to replicate it in a laboratory yet. While this may take more time, it is possible that researchers will eventually be successful.
1705	If possible, it would be helpful to have more information regarding the evolutionary differences between ancient and modern humans. For example, do we have evidence of how these differences affected things such as organ size, facial characteristics, and heart rate? Furthermore, do we have data regarding how different populations adapt to their environments? It is also interesting to note the different physical attributes of different populations which can be seen in today's world.
1706	If you have data to support the notion that modern humans have evolved from a common ancestor, it would be interesting to look at anthropological records of these factors, such as organ sizes, hair patterns, and facial features to compare the differences between different racial groups. It is possible that differences between racial characteristics may have been influenced by regional and/or cultural factors.
1707	If possible, please do so. We can gain insights from studying fossils and genetic data to better understand the evolutionary changes that have occurred in human physical characteristics over time. Additionally, studying modern humans can give us an understanding of the different physical attributes of modern humans.
1708	If possible, please do so. We can get an idea of the physical attributes of early humans from various sources, such as fossil records, which can give us insights into changes in organ size and bone structure, as well as hair and skin color. This can give us an idea of how modern humans differ in these regards compared to their ancestors.
1709	If modern human evolution is taken into account, it is possible to see that physical characteristics such as organ sizes, hair patterns, facial features, and heart rates differ between different racial groups. Genetic studies have shown that these variations are due to adaptations to different environmental conditions in different regions, which has led to the evolution of modern humans over time.
1710	I understand the importance of these theories and how they can shape our understanding of the world. It is fascinating to learn about both evolution and creationism, and I believe that it is important to study and understand both theories. While it is important to debate these theories, I believe that learning about them is more beneficial than requiring complete conviction of either one.
1711	I understand that the origins of life are an important issue, and that different theories such as evolution and creationism have been proposed to explain the process. While I believe that debating these theories is interesting and can help us better understand the concepts, I personally do not believe that it is necessary to be convinced of either side in order to accept the other's view.
1712	I understand the appeal of both theories, but I personally think that evolution is a better explanation for the origin of species. It provides a more consistent explanation for how species change over time and explains the biological evidence better than creationism.
1713	I understand the importance of evolution and creationism to some people, and that debate around these theories can be interesting and informative. However, I personally do not think that debating these theories is necessary as I do not believe it adds much value to the discussion.
1714	I understand that the debate is an important part of learning and understanding both sides of the argument, but I personally believe that the choice of whether to believe in evolution or creationism should be up to the individual. While it can be interesting and helpful to understand both perspectives, I don't think it is necessary to debate the issue.
1715	I agree with phro that the peppered moths do not provide evidence of evolution. While different alleles may be expressed due to external factors, this does not necessarily indicate evolution. In order to show evolution, it is necessary to have a change in the genetic makeup of the organism over multiple generations.
1716	I agree with phro that the peppered moths provide evidence of evolution. The data suggests that evolution did occur, as changes in the genetic makeup of the moths were caused by environmental factors.
1717	I agree with phro that the peppered moths provide evidence of evolution. The data was sufficient to show that evolution occurred.  The presence of different alleles was due to evolutionary changes occurring as a result of external factors.
1718	I would agree that peppered moths do demonstrate evidence of evolution. It is true that the data was insufficient to conclude this with certainty, but evolution did occur. Specifically, changes in the allele frequencies of the moths were due to external factors, which is a demonstration of evolution.
1719	I agree with phro that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data suggests that evolution occurred, as demonstrated by the changes in the expression of alleles due to external factors.
1720	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable prior to the Theory of Evolution. However, the "circular reasoning" argument suggests that God's existence could be impossible, as complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1721	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful, loving, and personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life can be explained by a process of evolution over time, governed by natural laws.
1722	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is certainly feasible, but such a being would require a higher level of complexity than I can imagine. Therefore, life's complexity cannot be explained by a simple creator.
1723	I used to believe that belief in God was reasonable prior to the theory of evolution, however, the “who created the creator” argument suggests that an all-powerful, loving, and personal God is as complex an entity as I can imagine, implying that life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1724	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, personal God is certainly possible, but the evolution of life on Earth requires an explanation beyond what we can currently comprehend.
1725	I also find it notable that there is currently a seven to three vote in favor of pornography being wrong, indicating that there is a stronger opinion on the side that pornography is wrong than there is a conviction of why it is wrong.
1726	I also find it interesting that there is currently a seven-vote margin in favor of pornography being wrong, compared to other activities that are considered acceptable by the majority of voters. This suggests that there is a level of subjectivity involved in the decision making process, as there is not yet a clear consensus as to why pornography should be considered wrong.
1727	I also find it interesting that there are currently seven votes in favor of "Porn is wrong" while no one has yet to explain why they believe this. This suggests that there is an underlying belief that porn has negative consequences, which raises questions as to why this is the case.
1728	I find it notable that there are currently seven votes in favor of "Porn is wrong," compared to fewer votes in favor of other options. This could indicate that there is more societal agreement with the notion that porn is inherently negative, which could be an indication of potential underlying issues.
1729	I also find it notable that there are currently seven votes in favor of pornography being wrong, though no one has yet to provide an explanation as to why this is the case.
1730	Making a profit from something that is generally seen as a social activity, like sex, can be a valid business strategy. This concept is not necessarily right or wrong, it could prove to be successful in certain situations.
1731	Making a profit from something that is largely accepted and seen as acceptable can be a wise decision, as there is likely to be a demand for it. This can be particularly true for items or services that are in high demand, such as sex.
1732	Making a profit from something that is widely available, such as sex, is not inherently wrong; if anything, it can be viewed as an ingenious business decision.
1733	Making a profit from sex is a viable option as it is a service that people demand, meaning that there is potential for profitability.
1734	Making a profit from something that is increasingly available through various platforms can be seen as a wise business decision, as there is clearly a demand for these services.
1735	Schools may not be the best environment to teach children about sex and sexuality, but pornography can provide an accurate depiction of sex, as well as offer educational examples. This provides an important learning opportunity that parents may not always be able to provide.
1736	Schools can only provide an incomplete view of the world due to parental restrictions, but pornography can offer a more realistic demonstration of the world. While parents may have concerns about the content of pornography, it can provide educational value as well as real-world examples.
1737	Schools cannot always provide an accurate depiction of certain topics due to parental restrictions, but pornography can give some insight into certain topics as well as provide examples. Therefore, it is not wrong to use pornography as an educational tool in schools.
1738	Schools cannot provide an accurate demonstration of sex education due to parental restrictions. However, pornography can provide some information as well as give examples that can be observed.
1739	Schools cannot provide an accurate depiction of sex due to parental restrictions, which is why pornography is often used as a source of sexual education. While some parents may object to this, pornography can serve as an effective teaching tool in addition to providing visual examples.
1740	Given the choice, I would choose to help others in any way I can. Even a small act of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, such as being a friend or assisting them in their daily struggles.
1741	Having the ability to do both would be wonderful, but since I must choose, I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small action can make a meaningful difference in someone's life, such as being a friend or assisting them in getting their needs to survive life.
1742	Having the ability to help others in multiple ways would be great, but since I must choose, I prefer to help others in whatever way I can. Even a small action can make a difference in someone's life, such as being a friend or assisting them in gaining the necessities to survive life.
1743	Having the ability to do both would be great, but since I have to choose I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small action can make a difference in someone's life, such as being a friend or helping them to meet their basic needs to survive life.
1744	Having the ability to do both is ideal, but since I must choose, I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small gesture can make a difference in someone's life, such as being a friend or aiding them in their efforts to survive life.
1745	I think school uniforms are a good idea. First, they help students look nice and tidy, which makes it easier to identify them as part of a school community. Second, they allow us to know that students from the same school may be at nearby schools or even our own. This can be helpful in terms of convenience, as parents do not need to spend too much time choosing clothing for school.
1746	I believe school uniforms can be beneficial. First, they help students look neat and tidy, which promotes a sense of unity and identity within the school. Additionally, they make it easier for students to recognize one another and for parents to know which school their children are attending. Finally, it is convenient since parents do not need to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
1747	I think school uniforms can be beneficial. First, they help students look neat and tidy. Second, we can tell who is studying in the same school or who is in the same school with us, which is convenient. Finally, it can make choosing clothes to school easier, as uniforms require less time and effort.
1748	I believe that school uniforms are a good idea. First, they help students look presentable and neat. Additionally, they allow us to tell easily which school our fellow students are from, and make it more convenient as we do not need to spend too much time choosing clothing to school.
1749	I believe school uniforms are a positive policy. First, they give students a smart appearance and keep hygiene standards high. Additionally, they enable us to distinguish between students and make it easier for us to distinguish between schools. Finally, it facilitates a sense of unity among students while reducing the time spent choosing school clothing.
1750	Having a father is one of the most wonderful experiences a person can have. While a father may not always be present, at least a lousy father would be there in times of need. Fathers can provide a sense of security, stability and love, which is important for a child's development.
1751	I would rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, since a father is one of the most wonderful things that can happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father for anything. I believe lousy fathers are like this because they love their child, and they want their son or daughter to be as perfect as possible.
1752	Having a father is one of the best things that can happen to you; at least a lousy father would be there for you when you need someone. A father's love can make a huge difference in a child's life, even if it is not perfect.
1753	Having a father is one of the greatest gifts life can give you. Even a less than ideal father would be there for you when you need him. fathers can offer support and stability even if it is not perfect. i believe this is due to their love for their child, and their desire for their son or daughter to have the best possible life.
1754	I believe having a father is one of the greatest gifts life can offer. Even if a father is not ideal, he is still there for you and provides emotional support. Fathers can connect with their children in this way, even if it is not ideal. I think this connection comes from the love a father has for their child.
1755	I believe it is preferable to have a parental figure, even if it is not ideal to always live with the idea of having one or the doubt of how it could have been.
1756	I believe it is preferable to have at least a moderate relationship with a father than to have no father at all. While it is true that having a father can come with a certain amount of emotional stress, it is still better than living with the idea that one does not have a father or with the doubt of how it could have been.
1757	I believe it is better to have a mediocre parent than to be parentless, although having a parent is not ideal, living with the idea of not having one or doubts about what it could have been like to have one are valid concerns.
1758	I think it is better to have a less than ideal Father than to be Fatherless, as even having a Father can bring its own challenges. It is difficult to know what it would be like to have a Father, or to cope with the uncertainty of these situations.
1759	I believe it is better to have a parental figure than to be fatherless, even if it may not be ideal. Having a father present can provide stability, security and emotional support for a child, even if there is uncertainty about how it could have been.
1760	Having a father is important, as they can provide emotional support and guidance throughout a child's life, even if it is not perfect. This makes a father a constant figure in the child's life, even in difficult times.
1761	I think it is better to have a father than a fatherless home, as you can always count on your father. Even during difficult times, a father provides support. Without a father, you do not have that same sense of security and guidance.
1762	Having a father is important for providing emotional support and guidance, even during difficult times. If you do not have a father figure, you may not have as strong a sense of right and wrong, and you may not have someone to confide in.
1763	Having a father is important as it provides a sense of security and stability. Even if the relationship with the father is not ideal, you can still count on him being there for you in both the good and bad times. Without a father, it can be more difficult to know the right and wrong.
1764	Having a father figure is important as it provides comfort and stability in life. Even if the father is not perfect, you can still count on him in both good and bad times. This is more beneficial than having no father, as you can turn to him for guidance and support.
1765	I would rather have a father I can still relationship with than not have a father at all. While I may need his help at times, having a father relationship is important and can provide comfort and support.
1766	Having a lousy father is not ideal, but I believe it is better than not having a father at all. While there may be moments when I need his help, it is possible that I will regret not having a fatherly figure in my life. Nevertheless, I still love my father despite the lack of a relationship I want with him.
1767	Having a father is always better than not having one, as there will be times when you may need his help. Even though it may not help in the short term, it can provide comfort and companionship in the long run. Although I may not have the father I want, I still love him and appreciate him as a part of my life.
1768	Having a lousy father is better than not having one at all, because you may need his help at some point. Although it may not help, you still have a relationship with your father, even though it is not what you want.
1769	Having a father is important in one's life, even if it may not be ideal at times. I believe that it is better to have a father that you can still get help from, even if it is not what you want. While I may not have the father I want, I still love him and appreciate the relationship I have with him.
1770	Having a bad father is better than having no father at all. Being fatherless offers no chance of eventually having a good father. Therefore, having a lousy father is better than nothing at all.
1771	Having a bad father is better than having no father at all, as there is potential for the father to become good at something in the future. Whereas being fatherless provides no chance of having a good father.
1772	Having a father that is not necessarily good can be better than having no father at all, since there is the possibility of eventually having a good relationship with a father in the future. Having fatherless, however, offers no chance of having a good father-fatherless relationships are more difficult to develop.
1773	I feel that it is better to have a lousy father than to have no father at all. While it is true that there is a possibility of improving in a skill with practice, having a father is something that requires nurturing from a young age in order to have a positive relationship. Therefore, having any kind of father is better than none.
1774	Having a father, even a lousy one, offers the potential for a better relationship in the future compared to not having a father at all.
1775	Estimates put the global bottled water market at between $50 and $100 billion per year, with the market growing at an annual rate of 7%. However, from a sustainability perspective, bottled water is not a viable option, due to the amount of resources needed to produce it.
1776	Estimates vary the global bottled water market to be between $50 and $100 billion annually, with a growth rate of 7% per year. Bottled water is a lucrative industry, but in terms of sustainability, it is not ideal.
1777	Estimates indicate that the global bottled water market is worth between $50 and $100 billion per year, with the market growing at an annual rate of 7%. Bottled water is a lucrative industry, however, in terms of sustainability, it is a losing proposition.
1778	Estimates indicate that the global bottled water market could be valued between $50 and $100 billion annually, with the market growing at a rate of 7 percent yearly. Although this shows significant growth, bottled water is not as sustainable as other drinks due to the packaging involved.
1779	Estimates vary, placing global bottled water sales between $50-$100 billion per year, with the market growing at an annual rate of 7%. Bottled water is a profitable industry, however, in terms of sustainability, it is a non-renewable resource.
1780	With a computer, you can access news sites for up-to-date information, as well as gain access to a wide range of educational materials. Additionally, computers are more versatile than TVs, which are limited to broadcast news and can be more difficult to find certain information.
1781	A television can be a useful tool for learning, as it allows access to live news as well as educational programs. While books offer a depth of information that is often unavailable on TV, television can provide a wider range of current events and news.
1782	TV is often preferred to reading books because it can bring you live news more quickly, which is useful in our fast-paced world. It can also provide educational content that is more engaging than what books offer.
1783	Reading books can provide knowledge, but watching news on television can provide you with live information as it happens, allowing you to stay informed on current events. TV also provides educational programs that can broaden your horizons.
1784	Television is an excellent source of news, as it can provide live coverage of events that are happening all over the world. Books are great for learning and education, but they do not provide the same immediacy as television.
1785	You can download the Foxtel Go app onto your iPad, enabling you to watch TV anywhere and anytime you want.
1786	With the "Foxtel Go" app, you can watch TV on your Ipad anywhere and anytime you choose.
1787	The Foxtel Go app can be downloaded onto iPads, allowing you to watch TV anywhere and anytime you want.

1789	You can download the "Foxtel Go" app on your iPad, allowing you to watch TV anytime and anywhere.
1790	You can just stay on the couch and enjoy a snack or meal while watching television if you don't feel like doing anything else.
1791	You can just stay on the couch with some snacks or a burger or sweets and watch TV when you don't feel like doing anything else.
1792	You can just watch television or relax with some snacks if you don't feel like doing anything else.
1793	taking a break and watching television can be a nice way to relax during downtime; however, it is also beneficial to get up and move around every once in while to stay energized.
1794	You can just stay home and relax with a movie or TV show, instead of venturing out, if you do not feel like doing anything else.
1795	The water bottles provide a safe source of water and offer a guaranteed level of safety.
1796	The water bottles are a safe and reliable source of water, providing peace of mind when it comes to safety.
1797	The water bottles offer a reliable source of water that ensures safety.
1798	The water bottles provide a safe source of water and can help ensure safety.
1799	The water bottles provide a reliable source of water and offer a safe way to ensure consumption.
1800	Bottled water is generally less available in developing countries due to the risk of contamination from large water storage containers. It is often safer and more convenient to distribute small bottles of water instead of bulk storage containers.
1801	Bottled water is less readily available in some developing countries where the safety of public water is still an issue. Government programs often distribute small bottles of water which is much easier than distributing large bulk storage containers to reduce contamination risk.
1802	Bottled water is less available in some developing countries due to the risk of the public water supply being unsafe to drink. Government programs often distribute small bottles of water for convenience, which is easier than distributing large bulk storage containers of water to prevent contamination.
1803	Bottled water is less common in some developing countries, where public water may be unsafe to drink. Government programs often distribute small bottles of water for convenience reasons, as compared to bulk storage containers. The contamination risk from large storage tanks is much less than from individual 12-20 ounce bottles.
1804	Bottled water is less common in some developing countries, where the safety of public water is a concern. It is easier for governments to distribute small bottles of water compared to large bulk storage containers, and the risk of contamination is lower with individual bottles.
1805	While bottled water can certainly be an expensive and wasteful option, there are some environmental benefits to using bottles that are reused instead of disposing of them; this is true of both plastic bottles and glass jars.
1806	It is true that bottled water can be a waste of resources, but the bottles can be reused.
1807	While bottled water may be expensive and generate a lot of waste, the bottles can be reused several times if properly cared for.
1808	Reusing bottles can help reduce the impact of bottled water, but it is still a waste of resources to purchase bottled water in the first place, as there are many other sources of drinkable water that are more sustainable.
1809	Bottled water may be a waste in terms of single-use plastic containers, but bottles can be recycled to be used again.
1810	If bottled water were not available, people would be more likely to drink sweetened drinks as their only portable option, leading to higher sugar intake and potential weight gain.
1811	If bottled water was not available, many people would be drinking sweetened beverages as an alternative due to the lack of portable drink options. This could lead to increased sugar intake and weight gain.
1812	If bottled water were not available, people might be more likely to drink sweetened drinks as an alternative as a portable beverage option. This could lead to greater consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, resulting in higher rates of obesity.
1813	If bottled water were not available, people may be more likely to drink sweetened beverages due to the lack of accessible alternatives. This could lead to higher sugar intake, which could increase the risk of weight gain.
1814	If bottled water were not available, people would be more likely to drink sugary drinks as their only portable option, leading to higher rates of obesity.
1815	Two people of the same gender being together does not necessarily align with nature, although we know the world is changing and ideas on family and relationships have evolved. Marriage, however, is still a legally and socially recognized institution, with legal and spiritual elements that are defined by the government and religious bodies respectively.
1816	Two people of the same gender together is not the natural setup for reproduction and creating new life, and marriage is an institution that is traditionally performed in front of God, with vows that come from the Bible. Although these unions may have changed in certain cultures, it does seem somewhat ironic that God may not approve of these unions, as nature is still the primary purpose of human interaction.
1817	It is natural for humans to pair off and reproduce, which is why marriage is designed to allow couples to make a lifelong commitment. This is reflected in religious ceremonies, which are held in the presence of God, as well as in the legal systems of many countries. Nevertheless, while society has changed and accepted new ideas, the purpose of two humans being together remains the same. Therefore, it appears that the concept of marriage runs counter to current beliefs in some ways, as God’s approval is still necessary for a marriage to take place.
1818	Marriage between two people, regardless of their gender, provides stability and a sense of family, which is important for reproduction and making new life. It is clear that couples have different beliefs and values, and that marriage is a choice that two people make for themselves, which is a decision that both the Bible and God acknowledge.
1819	Two people together is an important part of creating a strong and healthy society. It is natural for us to want to form close relationships and bonds in order to grow and support each other. However, marriage is a social institution that is traditionally recognized by religious institutions, such as in the Bible, which suggests that these relationships between two people are important for society.
1820	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it can be difficult to keep track of the posts. To help with this, I suggest that the argument system on the site be improved to make it easier to follow the arguments and rebuttals.
1821	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it can be difficult to trace the history of the arguments. It is possible that arguments are deleted by the authors, which can make it difficult to follow the threads of the arguments. It would be beneficial to have a better argument/rebuttal system on the site to make following these arguments easier.
1822	For those following the threads of arguments and rebuttals, it appears that chasbas' argument, which I rebutted on February 7th, 2007 at 7:09 AM, has been deleted. It is disappointing that the argument system on the site is not more reliable.
1823	In order to make the debate process more efficient, I believe the debates should be stored on the website for viewers to access and review. This would make it easier for viewers to follow the arguments and rebuttals and make it less likely for an argument to be deleted.
1824	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it can be difficult to trace the evolution of a particular point if the arguments and rebuttals are not presented clearly and consistently on the site. To help ensure such continuity, I make sure to provide a clear outline of the arguments and rebuttals in my posts.
1825	Guys and Girls were made for a reason. This reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex; it is so that they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites attract, as is evident in magnetism, electricity, atoms, and humans. Additionally, female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems only work together in couples of the opposite sex, which allows for reproduction.
1826	Guys and girls were made for a reason – it is biology’s way of ensuring that reproduction can take place. This is because, while males and females have different reproductive systems, they can come together to form a successful combination which allows for reproduction.
1827	Guys and girls are designed to pair up with each other, biologically and physiologically, in order to reproduce. This is also true for other species, such as humans, where male and female reproductive systems are designed to work together.
1828	Men and women were made for each other so that couples can form, in order to allow reproduction to take place. This is also true for same-sex couples, as men and women have different reproductive systems which enable them to naturally pair up. This allows for the possibility of reproduction.
1829	Guys and girls were made for a reason, which is that they are complementary to each other. Opposites attract and this is evident in magnetism, electricity and in the human reproductive systems, where males and females fit together in order to reproduce.
1830	I believe that the government should get out of marriage entirely, and allow religious institutions to perform ceremonies. On a personal level, I do not support same-sex marriage, as it goes against my own religious beliefs.
1831	I do not believe that the government should offer any specific tax incentives for marriage, as this could create an unnecessary dependence on the state's recognition of a marriage. I believe that religious institutions should make their own decisions regarding homosexuality, without external interference from the government.
1832	I do not support the government giving tax breaks or other incentives for couples to get married, as I believe this should be decided by the churches themselves. Allowing same-sex marriages goes against my beliefs, as I believe that certain religious denominations should be able to decide these matters themselves.
1833	I think it is wrong for the government to provide tax incentives and other benefits for couples who choose to marry, as this can lead to favouritism towards certain unions. It should be up to the churches to perform marriages and I believe the government should stay out of it completely.
1834	I believe the government should not have any role in marriage. Churches should be able to perform marriages without government interference, and couples should not have tax incentives or filing statuses linked to their marriages. The government should not force its views on religions and individuals should be able to make their own decisions on marriage according to their beliefs.
1835	It is unnatural because different species of animals typically mate with members of the opposite sex, thus allowing for reproduction.
1836	It is natural for sexual creatures to mate with members of the opposite sex, as this enables the continuation of their species.
1837	It is unnatural to limit sexual expression to only one gender, as all sexual creatures generally mate with the opposite sex.
1838	It is unnatural to assume that all sexual couples must mate with the opposite sex, as this is not the case for all species.
1839	It is biologically impossible for two members of the same sex to produce offspring, meaning that homosexual relationships are not natural in the same sense as heterosexual relationships.
1840	There is potential for unity among religions in India, but due to the ongoing religious tension between Muslims and Hindus, it is unlikely to happen in the near future. Even if a country is able to become a leader in the region, it needs time and resources to look after its own development and integration with other countries.
1841	Potentially, India has the capacity to be a leading nation that unifies various religious groups. However, due to the ongoing tension between Muslims and Hindus, this is highly unlikely at present. India must have the necessary time and resources in order to be a leading nation.
1842	Yes, India has the potential to be a leading nation, however the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus could potentially be a barrier to this. As India is a large country, this tension could affect its ability to develop and integrate successfully with other countries.
1843	Of course it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. Although some countries have experienced internal conflict in the past, these countries need to have adequate resources and time in order to focus on other countries instead of themselves.
1844	Yes, it has the potential to become a leading nation, but the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would likely prevent this. I can't think of a country that has had large-scale internal conflict that has the resources and time to focus on other countries.
1845	India and China have the potential to redefine what third world country means in the future, as both countries are projected to be both first and third world countries simultaneously.
1846	India and China have the potential to significantly alter the traditional definitions of ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries, as both countries are projected to have first and third-world characteristics in the future.
1847	India and China could potentially shape the future of development in countries, as both are projected to be both first and third world countries in the coming years. This could cause these two countries to redefine what a third world country is.
1848	India and China have the potential to change the meaning of 'third world country' in the future, as both countries are expected to be both 'first world' and 'third world' countries simultaneously.
1849	India and China have the potential to reshape what it means to be a third-world country in the future, as both countries are projected to be both first- and third-world countries simultaneously.
1850	As humans, we cannot know for certain if there is a higher force or not. Christianity does provide a framework and shared beliefs, but it lacks solidarity compared to other religions. I compare it to a road with many different paths one can take to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With Atheism, the concept is clear and more scientific in its approach.
1851	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity lacks solidarity due to its diversity of beliefs, while Atheism offers a more unified concept with a clearer definition. I prefer the scientific approach of Atheism more.
1852	As humans, we cannot know for certain if there is a higher force or not. Christianity is not the only belief of Christianity, as it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with many different branches, as people adjust their religious beliefs to their own preferences. With Atheism, the concept is clearer and more scientific.
1853	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity is not the only belief among Christians, as it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with many different sides that people can adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With Atheism, the concept is clearer and more scientific.
1854	As humans, we cannot definitively know if there is a higher force or not. Christianity, however, lacks solidarity due to its diversity, as different people are able to adjust their beliefs to fit their personal views. I prefer the concept of Atheïsm, as it is more scientific and I like this approach.
1855	My issue with Christianity is that it is based on a belief system, rather than on an individual's actions and conduct. It does not take into account that there have been many terrible people of faith who have done terrible things, as well as many wonderful atheists who have done great things for the world. It is not fair to judge an individual's eternal fate based on a difference in beliefs.
1856	I disagree with the idea that Christianity is solely based on belief. While I understand that faith is an important part of the religion, I believe that Christianity puts more emphasis on an individual's actions and character than on whether or not they believe in certain things. It seems to me that Christianity is more concerned with a person's morality and overall character than with their beliefs.
1857	I agree that it is not fair to punish people for not believing in certain things, as belief should not be a requirement for entry into heaven or other afterlife rewards. However, I personally believe that Christianity is about more than just belief; it is also about following the teachings of Jesus, which can have an influence on a person's actions. This may be what separates a good person who is an atheist from a good person who believes in God.
1858	I believe that morality and ethics should be based on the actions of an individual and their impact on the world, rather than on their beliefs. Just as there are atheists who do good things and contribute positively to society, there are also believers who do likewise. It is unfair to judge an individual's fate based on their beliefs alone.
1859	I have a problem with Christianity, as it focuses on belief rather than actions. Even if an atheist does good things and leads a moral life, it is still possible to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is. This seems unfair to me.
1860	This debate presents a limited view of religion, as it suggests that the only options are Christianity or atheism. There are in fact a variety of different religions and beliefs that could be considered, such as theism or other spiritual beliefs.
1861	This debate assumes that the only two options are Christianity and atheism, when in fact there are multiple forms of theism and atheism. A more inclusive option would be "theism/atheism/other".
1862	This debate assumes that the only options are Christianity and atheism, when there are actually other belief systems, such as theism or animism, that could be included.
1863	This debate presents a limited view of belief systems, as it frames the options as solely Christianity or atheism. It should include other theistic belief systems as well, such as other forms of theism or pantheism.
1864	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are Christianity or Atheism. There are multiple belief systems which provide an alternative to these two beliefs, such as Theism or other beliefs, which should also be included as options.
1865	Occasionally, it may be necessary to use physical discipline in order to reinforce boundaries and maintain control, as talking to a child may not be enough to ensure their behaviour.
1866	Sometimes this is not enough to ensure good behavior from a child, and it can be helpful to have more concrete consequences in place to reinforce desired behavior.
1867	Sometimes, it may be necessary to use firm discipline, such as redirecting a child's behavior or setting limits in order to encourage desirable behavior. However, this can be difficult to do if a child is not cooperative, as it may require physical contact or verbal guidance in order to be effective.
1868	Occasionally, it may be necessary to use more firm discipline with children in order to get them to behave. It can be difficult to enforce rules when children refuse to listen or comply, and it may take more effort to reinforce positive behavior.
1869	Occasionally, a firm but gentle approach is necessary to rein in children's misbehavior. Nos, stops, and other disciplinary measures can help curb misconduct, but sometimes these strategies are unsuccessful.
1870	I agree that it is important for children to understand the consequences of their actions. In order for them to learn from their mistakes, it is important for them to receive consequences that will allow them to understand the repercussions of their actions.
1871	I agree that discipline is important for learning and helping children understand the consequences of their actions. Consequences should be commensurate with the action, in order to ensure that the child understands the consequences of their actions and is deterred from repeating it in the future.
1872	I agree that punishment is necessary to help a child understand the consequences of their actions and learn from their mistakes. Consequences should be given to help them understand the consequences of their actions and prevent them from repeating the same mistake in the future.
1873	I agree that children need to understand the consequences of their actions and that learning from these consequences is a key part of their education. It is important that their actions are properly punished so that they understand the severity of their actions and are less likely to repeat them in the future.
1874	I agree that discipline and consequence are important for children to learn from their actions. This will help them understand the consequences of their actions and prevent them from repeating the same mistake.
1875	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, while a religious person believes in a higher power. Atheism should be constantly fed by new evidence and experiences, but faith can be grounded in a person's own beliefs and experiences.
1876	Atheism is based on scientific evidence, while faith is based on one's emotional and spiritual beliefs. Although atheists seek to dispel the presence of God, religious people have their own personal beliefs which they feel strongly about. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and experience.
1877	Atheism is based on science, while faith is based more on the idea that one should believe in a higher power. Atheism requires constant evidence and proof, while faith does not need to be actively sustained. However, everyone has the right to form their own opinions and beliefs.
1878	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on a person's beliefs and feelings. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but a religious person believes that an entity exists. Atheism should be constantly fed and nurtured, but faith should not be totally suppressed.
1879	Atheism is based on scientific evidence, while faith is based on a person's spiritual beliefs. An atheist looks for proof of what they believe, while a religious person simply has faith in their beliefs. Atheism must be constantly supported by evidence, but faith does not need to be constantly strengthened.
1880	Spanking is not an effective way of disciplining a child as it may cause them to become angry and not understand what they did wrong.
1881	Spanking is not an effective way to discipline a child as it may lead to them feeling angry and not understanding what they did wrong.
1882	Parents should not rely on spanking as a form of discipline, as this may cause the child to become angry and prevent them from understanding their actions.
1883	Parents should not use physical punishment, such as spanking, to discipline their children, as this can lead to resentment in the child and make it more difficult for them to understand the consequences of their actions.
1884	Parents should not use spanking as an form of discipline as it can make the child feel angry and prevent them from understanding their actions.
1885	Yes, physical punishment can have long-term psychological effects on a child, and could lead the child to believe that hitting is an acceptable form of discipline.
1886	No, hitting a child can cause lasting psychological damage and may lead the child to believe that physical punishment is acceptable.
1887	Yes, spanking can have short-term effects on a child's behavior, such as increased aggression or decreased prosocial behavior, which could have a long-term negative impact on their behavior. However, this should be weighed against the potential benefits of physical discipline, such as improving compliance and reinforcing parental authority, which could lead to better behavioral outcomes in the long run.
1888	No, because hitting a child can cause lasting psychological harm, as well as lead them to believe that physical punishment is acceptable.
1889	No, hitting a child can cause them emotional and psychological trauma, as well as lead them to believe it is acceptable to hit their own children.
1890	I would turn them in if it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense, they may get away with it, but I would not want to spend the rest of my life feeling guilty, as my conscience would bother me. Additionally, I could not live with the knowledge that a family is grieving due to my spouse’s actions.
1891	I would turn them in regardless of the motive. If it was self-defense, the perpetrator may get away with it, but if it were an act of rage, I would find it difficult to live with the knowledge that a family is suffering due to my spouse's actions. My conscience would bother me and I could not cope with that thought.
1892	I would turn them in regardless of whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it were self-defense, they could get away with it; however, I would not want to spend the rest of my life feeling guilty or knowing that a family is mourning due to my actions. My conscience would bother me and I could not live with that.
1893	I would turn them in if it was either self-defense or an act of rage. If it were self-defense, they may get away with it, but I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that feeling of guilt, or knowing that a family is grieving due to my actions. My conscience would trouble me too much.
1894	I would turn them in if it was either self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense, the perpetrator may be allowed to go free, but I would find it difficult to live with the guilt and the grief that it causes a family. My conscience would be a constant struggle.
1895	I would inform the authorities if my spouse confessed to committing murder. The police would be able to determine the intent behind the crime if it was an accident or deliberate. In a situation where my spouse murdered yours, I would want to know the facts in order to take necessary action.
1896	I would notify the authorities if my spouse committed murder, regardless of whether it was an accident or deliberate. The police would be able to establish the facts in such a case. For example, if my spouse murdered your spouse, I would make sure that I knew the details. In life, there are often greater considerations than just ourselves.
1897	I would alert the authorities if my spouse confessed to murder. Whether it was an accident or intentional, the police will be able to determine the facts. If it was an accident, I would want to know the details. In some cases, knowing more is better than knowing less.
1898	I would inform the authorities if my spouse confessed to committing murder. Whether it was an accident or deliberate act, the police will be able to determine the details. If it was an accident, the authorities would be able to investigate this. We have a responsibility to know what happened in cases such as these, particularly if it involves someone else.
1899	I would inform the authorities if my spouse confessed to murder, regardless of whether it was an accident or intentional. It is important to know what happened in such situations, especially if it involved my spouse and another person.
1900	I believe that it depends on the situation. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I would rather him kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason, I would turn him in, as love is strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer, as these actions could have long-term consequences.
1901	I believe that if my husband killed someone in self-defence, I would rather him take the life of the person rather than my husband dying, as love can be strong but it can also be blind. However, if he had killed someone without reason, I would turn him in, as I would not want to be married to a murderer, especially if he chose to kill me one day.
1902	I think that, in general, it is better for the crime to be punished rather than for the crime to go unpunished, so if my partner killed someone, I would choose for them to be imprisoned rather than for my partner to die. Although love is strong, it can also be blind, and I would not want to be married to a murderer.
1903	I put my argument on the side saying "no", as I believe that love is strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer, even if my husband killed someone in self-defence. It is difficult to judge a situation like this, as each case is unique.
1904	I believe that in this situation, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the circumstances. If it was a justifiable homicide, I would be more likely to turn my husband in, as love is strong but it can also be blind. However, if my husband killed someone without cause, I would not want to be married to a murderer, as this could lead to worse consequences.
1905	The government can regulate what women can do with their bodies, as it has the authority to enact laws to protect public health and safety. For example, it is illegal to commit suicide, as it poses a risk to an individual's health and well-being, which is a legitimate government interest. Likewise, it can also limit what an individual can do if it determines that it is in the best interests of the individual and/or society.
1906	The government does set certain guidelines for women regarding what they can and cannot do with their bodies; for instance, abortion is regulated by the government in some states in the U.S. Additionally, suicide is illegal in most states, which means the government can step in and take control if it deems that an individual is a risk to themselves.
1907	In some cases, the government does regulate what women can do with their bodies, such as with regard to reproductive rights and access to abortion. In other cases, such as with regard to mental health and suicide, the government may intervene to protect an individual's wellbeing.
1908	Actually, the government can regulate what women can do with their bodies as they deem necessary. For instance, in some states it is illegal to abort a fetus, as the government has determined that abortion access must be restricted in certain cases. Similarly, it is also illegal to commit suicide, as the government has determined that it could pose a danger to an individual if they are able to take their own life.
1909	In some cases, the government does intervene and place restrictions on what individuals can do with their bodies, such as in the case of abortion laws. Additionally, it is illegal to commit suicide in most states, and individuals who attempt to take their own lives could be subject to involuntary mental health treatment.
1910	No matter what circumstance a woman is in, she has the right to choose to carry a pregnancy, as she is the one who is physically impacted by pregnancy. In cases of rape, the baby is innocent and the mother must make the difficult decision of whether to continue the pregnancy or terminate it. The mother’s decision should be respected, as she is the only one who knows what is best for her and her body. Women have the right to make these decisions, as these are life choices that must be made. These are children’s lives that we are talking about.
1911	No matter what circumstances a woman is in, she has the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. However, the baby is innocent, and it is unfair for the mother to make this decision alone.  In the case of rape, it is understandably difficult for a woman to continue a pregnancy, but the baby is still alive and deserves a chance at life. It is important to consider both the mother’s needs and the baby’s rights when making this difficult decision.
1912	No matter what circumstance a woman is in, the pregnancy can be a difficult situation for her to be in. When rape occurs, the baby may not have had a choice to be conceived, and the mother is offered options to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both mother and child. Women have the right to make their own decisions, however, it is important to remember that these are lives that are being impacted by their choices.  If a woman chooses to keep the baby, she must take on the responsibility of caring for it.
1913	No matter what situation a woman is in, she has the ability to become pregnant due to the biology of reproduction. When rape occurs, the baby is at risk of death and both the baby and the mother are affected by the trauma. Women have the right to decide if they keep the baby, but that decision can have a significant impact on the child’s life. It is important to consider both the mother’s and the baby’s needs when making such a decision.
1914	No matter what circumstance a woman is in, she has the right to choose whether to keep the baby or not. When rape occurs, the baby is innocent and has no choice in the matter. Although the mother is responsible for the pregnancy, the child's life should be taken into consideration. While women do have the right to make this decision, it is important to consider the consequences of their decision.
1915	What we are dealing with is the potential loss of a life that may have had the potential to make a positive contribution to society; abortion takes away this chance.
1916	What we are dealing with is potential murder if a woman chooses to abort a fetus, as abortion directly removes the potential for a life to reach its full potential, which could have been a huge contribution to society.
1917	What we are dealing with is the potential loss of a life that could have made a significant contribution to society if the woman chooses to abort the pregnancy. Every individual has the right to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health, and society should not intrude on this right.
1918	What we are dealing with is the potential loss of a life that may have had the potential to make a significant contribution to society if the woman chooses to abort the pregnancy. While this is a difficult decision, it is ultimately her choice to make.
1919	What we are dealing with is the potential loss of a life that may have been a great contribution to society; abortion eliminates this possibility. This is a difficult decision for a woman to make, but she must weigh her options carefully in order to make the best decision for her and her circumstances.
1920	PE classes should still be offered in high schools, but it might be better to make them optional rather than requiring them throughout all four years of high school. Perhaps, in lower grades, it should be mandatory as children are more likely to gain or lose weight in unusual patterns.
1921	PE classes should be offered in high schools, but it is not necessary to make them mandatory throughout all four years of high school. It could be made optional, with the notion that PE should be taken for one year, instead of continuous classes. In lower grades, yes, PE should be mandatory due to the fact that younger students are more likely to gain or lose weight in strange patterns.
1922	PE classes should be available in high schools, however, PE should not be required for all four years of high school. It could be made an optional class with one year being made mandatory instead of continuous PE classes. In lower grades, yes, it should be made mandatory as children are more likely to gain and lose weight in unusual patterns.
1923	PE classes should still be offered in high schools, although they should not be required for all four years of high school. Ideally, PE should be an optional class and only one year should be made mandatory instead of a continuous class. In lower grades, yes it should be made mandatory as children are more likely to gain and lose weight in unusual patterns.
1924	PE classes should be offered in high schools, but they should not be required for all four years. Instead, PE could be offered as an optional class, with one year being made mandatory instead of continuous PE classes. In lower grades, yes it should be mandatory as young children are more likely to gain and lose weight in unusual patterns.
1925	The cost of college classes can be prohibitive for some students, depending on the course, which can be especially true for non- varsity athletes, as they are unable to waive the class.
1926	AP classes can be challenging for students who are not involved in varsity sports, as those students are often put at a disadvantage compared to their peers who are in varsity sports due to the requirement of taking the classes.
1927	AP students should be exempt from taking these classes, as it can be expensive and unfair for them, as some students may benefit more from these classes than others depending on their school's curriculum.
1928	The cost of college classes can be prohibitively expensive for some students, especially those who are not on varsity sports teams, as varsity athletes are able to waive the classes. This can be unfair and detrimental to their academic progress.
1929	The requirement that students must pass certain classes in order to graduate can be difficult for some students, particularly if they are not involved in varsity sports, as varsity athletes are able to waive these classes. This can be costly and unfair for these students.
1930	How can anyone argue that Gay Marriage is not a valid option? It is a personal choice that should be respected, as individuals should have the right to enjoy the same benefits as heterosexual couples if they choose to marry.
1931	Gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and choice, which should be respected by society. No matter what a person's beliefs are, they should have the same rights and access to the same benefits as straight couples.
1932	It is important to recognize that marriage is a union that is legally and socially recognized by a state, and as such, the government has an interest in recognizing marriages between same-sex couples, in order to grant them the same rights and benefits that are offered to straight couples.
1933	Gay marriage should be seen as an equal option, as couples of the same-sex have the right to choose whether to marry or not, which is a matter of personal belief. As such, no one should be denied the rights and benefits that marriage offers for straight couples.
1934	How can anyone argue that gay couples should not have the same rights as heterosexual couples, including access to the same legal and social benefits? Homosexuality is a natural orientation and couples should have the right to enjoy these benefits, just like straight couples do.
1935	Gay marriage has become increasingly accepted by society in recent years, and I am a strong supporter of gay rights. Marriage is described as the union of two people who care about each other, regardless of whether or not they have children. Some straight couples choose to marry for the benefit of having children, but this implies that marriage has no other purpose. As our society develops, more and more people are coming to terms with the idea that gay marriage is acceptable.
1936	Gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and expression which, as supporters of LGBTQ+ rights, I strongly believe in. Marriage, as it has been defined by society, is a union between two people who love and care for each other, which is not limited to couples solely getting married for the benefit of having children. As we live in a more progressive society, more people agree that gay marriage should be accepted.
1937	Gay marriage is increasingly becoming accepted by society as more people come to recognize the right of two people to marry, regardless of whether they are able to have children. This reflects the development of our society, as people come to terms with the fact that gay marriage is acceptable.
1938	Gay Marriage is becoming more accepted in many countries as societies become more accepting of LGBTQ+ relationships. From a legal standpoint, marriage provides certain rights and benefits to a couple, including the ability to have children. While some couples may choose to marry for these reasons, it is not a requirement. As societies develop, more and more people are coming to terms with the idea that gay marriage should be legal.
1939	Gay Marriage is an issue that can cause conflict in some societies as it goes against long-held traditional values. However, in many countries, attitudes are changing and people are beginning to accept same-sex marriage as it becomes more common. This raises the question of whether marriage should exist solely to benefit couples, or whether it should exist to provide society with a structure to raise children. As society develops, more people are coming to terms with the idea of gay marriage being acceptable.
1940	Helping others for the common good can give you a sense of pride, but you need to have the means to do so. To have these means, you must have a personal pursuit of these opportunities first, which can lead to a greater good. However, this is not necessarily the case for everyone; it depends on the individual's interests.
1941	Helping others for the common good can give you a sense of pride, but you need the means to do so; first, you need to pursue your own interests, as personal pursuit is necessary for the advancement of the common good. I do not believe one is better than the other; it depends on the individual’s interests.
1942	Having the ability to help others can give you a sense of pride, but one must first have the means to help another person. Personally, I believe one must have their own pursuits in place before one can promote the common good. However, for some people, their pursuit of the common good may come before their own.
1943	Helping others for the common good can give you a sense of pride, but you must have the resources to be able to help others. Before one can have the common good, one must have personal pursuit. While this is true, for some people, their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1944	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride, but you need the resources and ability to help others first. You need to have personal pursuits in order to benefit the common good. However, some people may feel a sense of fulfillment from advancing the common good through their own personal pursuits.
1945	The United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence both emphasize the importance of the government protecting the natural rights of citizens, which includes the right to keep the fruits of our labor.  The Virginia legislature provided financial support to widows and orphans, as well as using tax money to construct projects for the common good, indicating a recognition of the responsibility of the government to provide for the people's welfare.  The issue of taxation without representation was a key factor in the American Revolution, indicating that the colonists were not opposed to taxation in general, but rather to being taxed without having a say in the legislative process.
1946	The Declaration of Independence states that people have the right to “the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right of pursuing and obtaining happiness” and the Constitution outlines the government’s responsibility to “promote the general welfare”. Both documents recognize the government’s responsibility to provide public benefits for the general good.  Similarly, the Virginia legislature provided funds for widows and orphans, as well as funds for construction projects. Taxation was not seen as an intrusion on rights but rather as a means of providing for the collective good. This shows that our founders believed in the value of taxation and the government providing public benefits.
1947	The ability to keep the fruits of our labor is a right that is protected in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before the Revolution, in which they levied taxes to provide money for widows and orphans and used tax money to fund construction projects for the common good.  They also had courts to protect citizens' rights.  This indicates that our founders were in favor of taxation as long as it was accompanied by representation.  While we have always had some form of taxation, this does not necessarily mean that we have been opposed to it.
1948	Our founding fathers were involved in colony governments before the Revolution, and Virginia in particular had courts and laws to protect the rights of citizens and ensure tax money was used for common good projects. In addition, the house of burgesses provided money to widows and orphans annually. While the original American colonies may not have had representation in taxation decisions, the right to taxation was seen as a responsibility of the government to the people.  All of this shows that our founding fathers were in favor of taxation in the past, which supports the notion that it is not inherently unacceptable.
1949	The argument states that the right to the fruits of our earnings is not explicitly mentioned in the documents cited, however our founding fathers were part of colony governments which provided funds for widows and orphans and used tax money to construct projects for the common good, showing that our ancestors were conscious of the need to provide safety nets for citizens. During the revolution, the colonies were opposed to taxation without representation, not taxation in general.
1950	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility.  If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicaid. Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
1951	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility.  If your child's condition is urgent, they may refer your child to the nearest emergency room for treatment. They are also required to report any suspected abuse to the proper authorities.
1952	It sounds to me like you have some difficulty. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If the child's condition is of concern, the doctor or emergency room may be required to make a report due to signs of abuse. Generally, CASA will only get involved if the issue is related to Medicaid eligibility.
1953	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility.  If your child has an injury, they may investigate to see if abuse is a factor, which would then trigger a report.  They may also just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicaid.
1954	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA - that’s Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility.  They may look into whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, depending on the situation.
1955	The official reason is that they help to keep the market stable by purchasing and selling when necessary. This allows them to take advantage of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money, albeit in a setting where such activity is regulated.
1956	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. This helps to maintain market conditions and minimizes sudden and dramatic shifts. This allows them to buy and sell when they can make money, giving them the opportunity to make profits.
1957	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. This helps keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts by requiring them to buy and sell under certain conditions. Additionally, they are able to take advantage of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money.
1958	The official reason is that they make an ‘orderly market’. This ensures that the market does not experience sudden and dramatic shifts, and they must purchase and sell when they can make profits, as the policy stands.
1959	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market'. This helps to prevent the market from having sudden and dramatic shifts. They must buy and sell under certain conditions to make use of these opportunities to make money. It is a trade-off that is enforced by the policy.
1960	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers.
1961	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there could be, is if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Clearly, each party needs their own legal representation.
1962	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. It could also cause issues if you had separate lawyers, which can be problematic in court cases. If this is the case, both parties need representation that looks out for their interests.
1963	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is legally and morally acceptable. Your ex-wife is taking legal action against you, while the new wife is taking legal action against her husband. This does not involve you directly, but if your ex-wife and you had the same lawyer, it could cause a conflict of interests. Therefore, each party needs their own legal representation.
1964	Yes, the two women have separate issues that need to be addressed in court. This is entirely legal and moral. Your ex-wife is taking legal action against you, and the new wife is taking legal action against her husband. These two cases are separate, so there could be a potential conflict if your interests were represented by the same lawyer. It is important that each party has their own legal representation.
1965	The leak of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent posed a greater risk to her safety and potentially that of our country, compared to the situation with Clinton's affair, as it could have jeopardized her security and that of our country. This caused greater concern and was thus given more attention by the media. Additionally, the media paid less attention to the Plamegate scandal since corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
1966	The leak of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was more serious as it put her life, as well as the security of the country, in jeopardy. The Clinton scandal only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea and was less of an issue for the general public. This was partially due to the fact that corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
1967	The leak of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent put her life and possibly the security of our country at risk, whereas Clinton's affair only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea and was of less interest to the public. This could explain why the media gave less attention to the Plamegate scandal, as corporations that own the media are major Republican donors.
1968	The disclosure of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent put her life, as well as the security of our country, in jeopardy. This was much more serious than the case of Clinton's infidelity, which affected only Hillary and Chelsea and did not concern everyone else. This incident received less attention from the media due to the fact that the corporations which own the media are major Republican donors.
1969	The CIA leak was more serious than the Clinton scandal. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, and possibly the security of our country, was put at risk. Compared to this, Clinton's affair only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and did not affect the public at large as much. One reason why the media gave less attention to Plamegate is because corporations that own the media are major Republican donors.
1970	I believe a woman should have the right to choose and there are many children out there who have to go through foster homes and lead difficult lives. I am pro-choice. I also think that if it is made illegal, there will be many women who will resort to having abortions in unsafe, unsanitary conditions, which can pose a danger to their health. I could never choose to do this, but it is important to consider the bigger picture. Do we want to pay higher taxes to cover the costs of raising these children, which could come from the government if the mothers did not want or could not take care of them?
1971	I believe that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are many children who have to go through foster homes and live difficult lives. I am pro-choice. If abortion is made illegal, women will risk serious health problems by going through unsafe procedures in “hole in the wall” places that are not hygienic or sanitary. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to make these decisions. I believe that when people are pro-life, they are not considering the bigger picture; higher taxes will come from the government having to take care of the children abandoned by their mothers who could not take care of them.
1972	I believe that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are many children out there who have to go through foster homes and live difficult lives. I am pro-choice and I believe that if it is made illegal, there will be many women who will resort to having abortions in places that are not sanitary or even torturous conditions. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to make the decision that you feel is best. I think that when people say they are pro-life, they are not considering the bigger picture; if the government has to pay higher taxes to take care of these children from the mothers who did not want or could not take care of them.
1973	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose and there are lots of children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very difficult lives. I am pro-choice; I also think that if it is made illegal, there will be many women who will risk dying from having abortions done in unsterile conditions. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to make the choice that you feel is best. I believe that when someone is pro-life, they are considering the bigger picture: higher taxes could potentially come from the government having to take care of the children who were abandoned by their mothers, who could not or were not able to take care of them.
1974	I believe a woman should have the right to choose and there are many children out there who have to go through foster homes and lead difficult lives. I am pro-choice and I believe that if it is made illegal, it could lead to women dying from having abortions done in unsafe conditions, which is a possibility. I could never choose to do that, but I believe it is important to look at the bigger picture; raising taxes to help take care of the children abandoned by their mothers could be an option.
1975	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's becoming more common for individuals and corporations to be subject to government surveillance, particularly when it comes to using tax money to fund operations.  However, while governments may have the right to access our data, it's important that we are aware of what information they are collecting, and how this data is used.  This is especially important given the potential for the misuse of personal information.
1976	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's generally accepted that the government should be able to access personal information in certain circumstances in order to protect national security and ensure public safety.  Though citizens do have certain rights to know what the government is doing with their information, these rights are limited in that the government is authorized to collect and use personal data in order to carry out its duties.
1977	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's dangerous to do so, as it can lead to serious consequences for the perpetrator and can take away an individual's right to privacy.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing with our money as it is our money that the government is using to pay for its activities.  Additionally, the government is increasingly intruding on our privacy through the use of surveillance and data collection, thereby limiting our privacy rights.  Thus, it is essential that we are able to access information about what the government is doing with our money.
1978	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's important to know what the government is doing with our money—our money is ultimately taken from us through taxation, and the government then uses that money to pay for services that affect our lives.  Fourth Amendment rights only protect us from unreasonable searches and seizures, and modern technology has allowed the government to access our data with increasing ease.  This presents a challenge to our Fourth Amendment rights, and thus our privacy is at risk.  While we still have Fourth Amendment rights, it is important to understand that these rights are being eroded by increasingly sophisticated technology.
1979	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's important to know what the government is doing with our money; while the Fourth Amendment establishes an expectation of privacy, government surveillance is a necessary and acceptable trade-off in order to ensure safety and security.  The Fourth Amendment has not been fully nullified, but some of its protections have been weakened in order to protect citizens.
1980	This guy has a point; while there have been some improvements in terms of freedom of speech in China in recent years, the Chinese government is still very oppressive and does still subject its citizens to beatings and torture. The U.S. often prefers to turn a blind eye in order to preserve economic ties, even though a lot of the labor in China is done by slaves. We need to start recognizing this reality.
1981	This guy has a valid point. Although there may have been a decrease in instances of government oppression in China in recent years, beatings and torture are still common practices there. The US tends to prioritize economic relations over taking a stance against such practices, even though much of the cheap labor in China is done by slaves. We need to wake up and start recognizing this.
1982	I agree that China has become increasingly oppressive when it comes to freedom of expression. Although instances of beatings and torture have declined in recent years, they are still a common occurrence in the country. The US tends to turn a blind eye to this situation, as we prioritize our economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor is done by slaves. We should wake up and start recognizing the truth.
1983	This guy has a point; the Chinese government does restrict freedom of speech and has been known to use physical force against activists and citizens who challenge its policies. While there have been reported improvements in recent years, beatings and torture remain common occurrences in the country. The US government is more concerned about preserving good economic ties, even though much of the low-cost labor is done by slaves. We should start seeing the truth more often.
1984	In recent years, the Chinese government has become less oppressive of those who question its policies, although beatings and torture remain a possibility in the country. The United States has chosen to prioritize its economic relations with China, even though many laborers in the country are exploited slaves. We need to start recognizing this reality.
1985	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I believe you should pursue compensation. Money will not change what those evil people did to you, but if you can get something out of the horrible experience other than anger and bitterness, then it may be worth it. I hope it all goes your way.
1986	If you can relieve the worst moments of your life again and come to terms with what happened, then suing for compensation may be an option. Money cannot change what happened, but it could provide some financial relief for you and your family.
1987	If you can relieve the worst moments of your life again, then I would suggest suing for compensation. Money cannot change what those evil people did to you, but if you can gain something from the experiences, then it is worth considering.
1988	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I say you should pursue compensation. Money will not change what those evil people did to you, but if you can get something out of the situation other than anger and bitterness, then it may be worth it. I hope it works out for you and your family.
1989	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I believe you should pursue compensation. Money cannot change what those evil perpetrators put you through, but if there is the possibility of gaining something from the situation, then this could be beneficial. You and your family deserve justice and closure.
1990	Probably not.  Not many people work for free unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc).  You MIGHT get someone to take the case on a contingency basis, which is to say they would get a percentage of the verdict.  This will only work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount.
1991	Probably not. Most lawyers require some form of payment, as law school and experience are expensive and require significant investments. The exception is if there is a strong social motivation behind the work (such as protesting discrimination), in which case lawyers may agree to take the case for free. This might also happen if the case has a high potential settlement amount.
1992	Probably not. Most lawyers will charge an hourly rate or a flat fee for their services, depending on the type of case. This is because law school and experience are expensive, and many lawyers need to recoup these costs. You may be able to find an attorney who is willing to take the case on a contingency fee, which means they get a percentage of the verdict. This is usually only the case if the case has a good potential settlement amount.
1993	Probably not. In most cases, lawyers will require payment up front in order to take the case, as law school and training are expensive and lawyers need to be compensated for their time and effort. If you have a good case and a high potential settlement amount, you may be able to find a lawyer willing to take the case on a contingency fee.
1994	It is possible to find lawyers who will take cases on a contingency fee basis, which means they get a percentage of the verdict, but this will only work if the case has a high potential settlement amount and the lawyer is confident of success.  Otherwise, you may have to pay for the service.  I spent years in law school and invested a lot of money to get my training, so I typically do not offer my services for free, unless there is a compelling social reason.
1995	I believe that a president needs effective speechwriters to be able to properly convey their message to the public. Hiring speechwriters with experience in public policy and speeches is the best way to do this. Debates are a good way to hear how a person speaks since they need to be more attentive than when they give an address.
1996	I don't have an issue with the use of speech writers; it is important to be able to convey messages effectively when you are leading an organization or a nation. Hiring experienced speech writers can help ensure the message is properly conveyed. Debates are good places to observe how a person speaks, as they need to be more on their toes than when giving an address.
1997	I do not think President Bush's inability to be an effective public speaker is a problem. It is important to have speechwriters when addressing large groups in order to effectively convey the desired message. Hiring such professionals is the best way to ensure that this occurs. Debates provide a good opportunity to assess a candidate's speaking skills since they must be more attentive than when they give an address.
1998	I believe that it is important for the President to be able to effectively communicate his message to the people. Hiring speech writers can be a good option to ensure the message is conveyed properly.
1999	I believe the ability to effectively communicate with the public is crucial to a president’s success. President Bush could have used speech writers to craft his messages, as this is a logical choice to ensure the ideas are communicated correctly.
2000	First of all, the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right to “the pursuit of happiness”; this phrase appears in the Declaration of Independence. In terms of enforcement, I would not expect much difference between laws relating to prostitution and other offenses. Additionally, I doubt that morality plays a role in the government's decision making when it comes to setting laws; for instance, the age of consent laws vary depending on the state.
2001	First of all, the Declaration of Independence does state that the government is intended to “secure” the rights of individuals, including the right to pursue happiness. However, the Constitution itself does not specifically mention this right.   Furthermore, I believe that the government does spend some resources enforcing laws related to prostitution, though perhaps less than other offenses.  Nevertheless, I would argue that the resources spent on enforcing these laws are proportionate to the severity of the crime.   Additionally, I do believe that morality has a role to play in criminal law, in that some laws are made in order to uphold society’s moral standards. For example, laws concerning age of consent help to protect minors from potential harm or coercion.
2002	First, the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase “the pursuit of happiness”, not the Constitution. However, the Constitution does guarantee the right to pursue one’s own happiness as a part of the right to liberty.   Additionally, I believe that law enforcement resources are allocated according to the severity of the crime, taking into account factors such as victim harm and potential for additional crime. However, I am willing to admit that there is a role for morality in criminal law, as the ages of consent are set to balance the interests of society.
2003	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the pursuit of happiness; this is reflected in the Declaration of Independence. In terms of enforcement, I doubt that much time and effort is spent in relation to prostitution compared to other offenses. Finally, do you agree that morality plays a role in criminal law? I mean, for example, laws regarding the age of consent: while consensual sex between 15 and 16 year olds is illegal, how do we draw the line?
2004	First, the Constitution does not guarantee the right to “the pursuit of happiness” as stated in the Declaration of Independence; rather, it guarantees the right to legal protection for certain fundamental rights, including the right to pursue happiness.   Further, I doubt that the resources allocated to enforcing laws relating to prostitution are significantly greater than those allocated to enforcing other laws.  As for morality in criminal law, I believe that laws relating to age of consent are in place to protect minors and ensure their safety.
2005	The difference between the two is more like that of elephants and rhinos; the legal status of an activity varies depending on the country and state laws, rather than the actual activity itself.
2006	The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises than Lions and Bats.  The reason one is legal and the other is not is due to laws enacted by legislatures; the actual differences between the two acts may be harder to discern. Generally, the legality of an activity is determined by the government, not by the actual differences between the activities themselves.
2007	The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises, not Lions and Bats. The legal distinction between prostitution and pornography varies by state, as some states have made it legal to receive money for sex while other states have made it illegal. It is up to the government to determine which activities are legal or illegal.
2008	The difference between the two is more like Dolphins and Porpoises rather than Lions and Bats.  The law says one is legal and the other is not; however, the actual difference between the two acts can be difficult to see. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone for free. This can be explained by the fact that the government has chosen to make some acts legal and others illegal.
2009	The difference between the two acts is more akin to that of whales and dolphins than lions and bats; in other words, the legal difference between them is largely based on the law, rather than any clear-cut distinction in terms of their actual content. While the legality of prostitution and the sale of sex films differ according to the law, the choice to make either activity legal or illegal is ultimately up to the government.
2010	In the United States, our justice system has developed over time and is far from perfect. It is flawed and is a product of human creation, which is true of all systems. However, it is getting better over time and offers protection and fairness for those who use it. We can make it better and improve it for future generations.
2011	The United States justice system has developed over time and is constantly improving. It is far from perfect, as any justice system is flawed to some extent, but it is considered to be the best we have thus far. While it is true that it may have some flaws, it is getting better over time and will eventually become better for future generations.
2012	The United States justice system has evolved over time and is still improving. It is far from perfect, but it is the best we have yet developed, and it is getting better. Even though it has its flaws, it provides a good foundation for continued improvement.
2013	The United States justice system has evolved over time and is still improving. It is far from perfect, as it is flawed and influenced by human elements, but it is the best system we have developed so far. Despite the claims of media, it has been getting better in recent years, offering greater opportunities for individuals and generations to come.
2014	The justice system practiced in the United States is evolving and has improved over time. It is far from perfect and has flaws, but it is still the best system humanity has devised so far. No matter what the media claims, it is getting better and will continue to do so, offering improved outcomes for future generations.
2015	1. Gather all your receipts. If you do not have the actual receipts, it may be possible to get them from the pharmacy or from your insurance company. 2. Send the receipts, a letter and the insurance claim form to the insurance company. 3. Cross your fingers and hope for the best.
2016	Gather all your receipts. If you don't have the actual receipts, it may be possible to get them from the pharmacy or your insurance company may be able to provide a print out of your purchases.   Send the receipts in and fill out the insurance company's claim form. This may increase your chances of being reimbursed.
2017	You may be able to recover the costs of your prescriptions.  Gather all your receipts and contact the pharmacy to see if they have your records on file. If not, reach out to your insurance company to see if they can provide reimbursement. If that does not work, send the receipts, a letter, and the insurance claim form to the insurance company for review.
2018	You may be able to. Here is what you can do:  1. Gather all your receipts. If you do not have the actual receipts, the pharmacy may be able to provide you with a printout of your purchases from their records.  2. Write a letter to the insurance company detailing the situation, and include copies of the receipts. 3. Fill out the claim form and send it all in.
2019	You may be able to. Here's what you can do:  1. Gather all your receipts. If you don't have the actual receipts, you may be able to get them from the pharmacy or from the insurance company. 2. Send the receipts and a letter to the insurance company explaining the situation. 3. Fill out the claim form and send it in.
2020	It is understandable that you may want help preparing a defense, but it is difficult for anyone to offer help without knowing all the details of the case. Even an attorney would need to spend time preparing a defense, and Y!A is not likely to be beneficial in this situation.
2021	It's understandable that you may want advice from a legal expert, but due to the nature of your case, it would take a lawyer a significant amount of time to prepare a defense, which would be difficult without knowing all the details. In this type of situation, Y!A is likely to be less helpful for you than it could be for other cases.
2022	Given that YAH cannot provide any guarantees as to the outcome of any given situation, it is advisable to seek professional legal help for such matters. An attorney would require some time to prepare a defense and advise the client better, which would be difficult without knowing all the details of the case.
2023	Getting reliable information online can be difficult, as certain details are necessary to give a comprehensive answer. While a lawyer could take time to prepare a defense, this is not possible without knowing all the details. Therefore, it is difficult to provide help in this situation without detailed information.
2024	Gathering the necessary information to provide assistance in your situation can be time-consuming. Since we cannot provide detailed advice without knowing the full context of your case, it may be difficult to obtain useful information here.
2025	Given the risks associated with drug offenses, California is safer with tougher laws in place to keep those convicted of drug offenses off the streets. While the penalty for a third strike may seem harsh, it is important to maintain public safety and ensure justice is served.
2026	Give me a break. Three strikes can potentially lead to life in prison, as the penalties become harsher for successive offences.  It is important to consider the impact of these crimes on the community and to ensure public safety.  We as Californians are safer with tougher sentences in place.  You know what they say… “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.
2027	Give me a break. Three strikes equate to life!  Living with the consequences of a crime can be tough, especially if it is a repeat offence.  While three-strike laws are in place to ensure public safety, it can still have an impact on the offender's life, making it difficult to reintegrate into society.
2028	Give me a break. Three strikes equals life!  Live with it!  You've been warned so don't ask for sympathy as the consequences of the third strike could be more severe.  It is true that the third strike could have been for a more serious crime than just pot.  We as Californians are safer without repeat offenders on the streets.  You know what they say: “If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.”
2029	Give me a break. Three strikes can result in life imprisonment if the crime committed is violent in nature.  Live with it!  We as Californians are safer with stricter laws in place to prevent repeat offences.  You know what they say... “If we can prevent crime before it happens, it is better than having to imprison offenders.  Even for non-violent offences, longer sentences can help make our communities safer.
2030	Yes, if it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate unless the mother's last name is also indicated on the birth certificate.  This way, both parents' last names will be listed.  In this way, both parents' legal rights to the child will be established.
2031	Yes, if it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate unless his partner agrees to put his last name on it.  It is important to ensure both parents' names are on the birth certificate in order to protect the child's legal identity.
2032	Yes, if it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate unless the mother's last name is also listed.
2033	Yes, if it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put on it.  The father's last name should be listed on the birth certificate as the baby will share the father's last name and surname.
2034	Yes, if it's his baby.  They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put on it.  That way, the baby will have the father's last name as well as the mother's.
2035	Wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it?   And... the answer is yes. The property management can place restrictions in the lease. Depending upon how the lease reads exactly, it can be difficult to determine whether a gun is allowed or not.
2036	Wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it?    The lease restrictions, as well as the state and local laws, determine what a tenant can and cannot keep inside their rental unit. Depending on the wording of the lease, the tenant may be allowed to keep a gun in their unit, but it will depend on the laws of the state and the local ordinances.
2037	Yes, the tenant had signed a lease agreeing to abide by it, even though they were aware that the property management could place restrictions in the lease. Depending on the exact wording of the lease, the tenant may still be able to keep a gun in their home with a loaded gun magazine or speed loader nearby. It will be difficult to prove either way.
2038	Wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it?   And... the answer is yes. They, the property management, can place restrictions in the lease. Depending on how the lease reads exactly, you may be able to keep a gun in your home, as long as it is unloaded and stored in a separate, secure location, such as a safe or lockbox.
2039	Wait...you signed a contract KNOWING you weren't going to abide by it?   Yes, I did. The lease agreement may restrict what types of firearms I can keep on the property, but I will still be allowed to keep a gun in my possession, with a magazine or speed loader nearby. It will be difficult to enforce either way.
2040	Unfortunately, no you cannot re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won t help a whole lot.  This can be a difficult experience for minors, who may not be aware of all the physical and emotional effects of an accident for years to come. Firestone's settlement may have provisions for such consequences if it happens in the future.
2041	Unfortunately, no you cannot re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help a whole lot.  It is important to remember that legal settlements such as this one are final, and you should be aware of any potential future consequences of the accident before settling.
2042	Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the case can be reopened; however, the experience is a valuable lesson to learn. The settlement likely contained an agreement that all future consequences of the accident can be claimed, depending on the state’s laws.
2043	Unfortunately, no you cannot re-open such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it is likely that any claims arising from the accident would be difficult to pursue. It is important to be aware of the potential future consequences of a crash at an early age, as any claims arising from it may be more difficult to pursue if the settlement takes place.
2044	Unfortunately, no you cannot re-open such a case, as the settlement took place without new evidence being presented. It is important to be aware of the potential long-term effects of an accident, so that you can take action accordingly.
2045	If you do it in GOOD FAITH, it is generally acceptable, as long as the language is primarily used for legitimate purposes and is not a cover for illegal activities. However, if the language is mainly created to avoid laws and regulations, it may not be accepted.
2046	If you do it in GOOD FAITH it is fine. Language learning is a valuable and important endeavor, and the courts recognize this. Additionally, language learning can help open up new cultures and opportunities, which can be beneficial to an individual in the long run.
2047	If you do it in GOOD FAITH it is fine. While this may draw negative attention initially, learning a new language can offer many benefits in the long run, from better job opportunities and enhanced cross-cultural understanding.
2048	If you do it in good faith, it is generally acceptable; however, if you are doing it solely to create a new language in order to explore a new culture and community, it may not be beneficial to you and you could be convicted of making terroristic threats.
2049	If you do it in GOOD FAITH it is fine, as long as the authorities are aware of your reasons for creating a new language and are satisfied that it was your primary purpose in doing so. Otherwise, you may face legal repercussions.
2050	I think it should not be accepted as evidence as it could have been influenced by coercion. There is no evidence that the defendant was able to understand and process complex thoughts. His low IQ may have rendered him vulnerable to coercion.
2051	I believe that the confession should not be accepted as evidence as it was likely influenced by coercion. There is no proof that the defendant was able to understand and process complex thoughts, which would have been required to express the words he is said to have uttered. Additionally, his low IQ likely made him susceptible to coercion.
2052	I believe the confession should not be accepted as evidence as it relies heavily on the defendant's low IQ, which made him susceptible to coercion. Additionally, there is no proof that the defendant was able to think of the crime in logical progressions, making it impossible to know for certain that he uttered the words he is said to have said.
2053	I believe the confession should not be accepted as evidence, as his low IQ made him more susceptible to coercion and there is no proof he actually spoke the words he is said to have uttered. Additionally, the language and thought process were too complex for the defendant to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
2054	I think the confession should not be accepted as evidence, as his low IQ made him more susceptible to coercion and there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered. Additionally, the complexity of the words and thought processes makes it difficult for him to think in logical progressions.
2055	Well, since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it.  There is no way to get her name off the loan.  The loan will remain on her credit report, but if it goes into default, then it will be her responsibility to pay off the loan.  Additionally, the loan company can take action against both borrowers to collect the money.
2056	Student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy if they are more than 10 years old, but this is the exception rather than the rule.  It is possible for the loan to go into default before collection agencies get involved, which is why it is important to keep track of loan payments.  However, if the loan is defaulted upon, then both borrowers could be held responsible for the debt.  In this case, the primary borrower will be sent the bill first, as they are the one who is legally obligated to pay it off.
2057	I understand that student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy any longer.  While it is true that the loan will go after the primary borrower first, there is a possibility that the lender may go after the co-signer if the primary borrower does not make payments.  If the lender is unable to collect from the primary borrower, they may then pursue the co-signer for payment.  I apologize if this has been unclear, but I want to reiterate that it is possible for the lender to pursue the co-signer for payment if the primary borrower fails to make payments.
2058	Student loans can generally be discharged in bankruptcy, but it depends on the type of loan and the borrower's specific circumstances. There are some exceptions, such as federal student loans, which cannot be discharged. However, student loans are often eligible for income-based repayment and other borrower protections, which can make them more manageable. If the loan enters default, the loan servicer can take action to collect from both borrowers.
2059	The loan company can take action to collect the debt from either the borrower or cosigner, depending on the terms of the loan.  Since the loan is in the borrower's name, the loan company can pursue them first.  If the loan goes into default, then it may become more difficult for the borrower to be released from the loan.  Therefore, it is important for the borrower to keep track of the loan and to contact the loan company if there are any changes in their situation.
2060	In order to avoid society’s perception of abortion as an option, abortion rights supporters have resorted to scare tactics to make abortion appear more socially taboo. This includes emphasizing the risks of abortion procedures, such as the risks of maternal mortality and birth defects, in order to make abortion seem more dangerous than it actually is. This is done in an effort to persuade women to choose alternatives to abortion, even if they feel it is the best option for them.
2061	In recent years, there has been an increase in legislation aimed at protecting the rights of women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as increasing access to reproductive health care. In some countries, this has led to a greater emphasis on providing women with information and access to abortion services, which can help them to make the best choices for their bodies and lives. While this is generally seen as a positive development, it has led to some concerns being raised about potential side effects, such as increased access to abortion leading to higher rates of abortion overall.
2062	Abortion is a controversial issue which divides opinion, with some people arguing that it should be legal in certain cases and others believing that it should be entirely restricted. Women may choose to terminate a pregnancy for a variety of reasons, such as if they feel they are not able to give the baby the best life situation, or if they feel it would put their health or life at risk. Whatever the reason, the decision to have an abortion is an intensely personal one and women should have the right to make this choice if they desire.
2063	Abortion is a controversial subject that provokes strong emotions on both sides. There is no doubt that abortion carries ethical and moral implications, and many countries have laws and policies in place to regulate it. However, some women choose to terminate their pregnanays for various reasons, such as to ensure the safety of their health or that of their family. To counteract this, anti-abortion activists have raised concerns about abortion and its potential risks, which can be challenging for women to access accurate information about the procedure.
2064	Abortion has become a contentious issue in many societies due to its ethical implications. Although some people believe that access to abortion reduces the risk of maternal mortality and can give women more control over their bodies, there is still opposition to it due to moral and religious grounds. To counter this, many countries have implemented laws that allow abortion in certain cases, such as in cases of rape, incest, or when the pregnancy puts the woman's health at risk. Additionally, many countries provideaccess to emergency contraception which can prevent fertilization. This helps to ensure women's reproductive rights while balancing various interests.
2065	They do not do that in court. It is a Hollywood thing. I have visited court several times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and they only ask you to raise your right hand and swear that the statement you are about to give is the truth. They also sometimes administer an oath.
2066	They do not typically swear witnesses in court; instead, they ask them to raise their right hand and say that the statement they are about to give is the truth. This is usually the only form of affirmation required.
2067	They don't do that in court. It is a Hollywood thing. I have observed court proceedings several times and have never seen them do this. They usually ask the witness to raise their right hand and swear that the statement they are about to give is the truth. That is all.
2068	They do not typically do this in court proceedings. I have observed court proceedings several times and have never seen them require a judicial oath; instead, they ask the individual to raise their right hand and swear that the statement they are about to give is the truth.
2069	They do not typically do this in court proceedings. From my experience observing court proceedings, they typically ask the witness to raise their right hand and swear that the statement they are about to give is the truth.
2070	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you?  If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy.  Regardless of what you feel about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employ unless you belong to a union.  I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy.  You could choose to either (1) stop smoking or (2) go off the property to smoke.
2071	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you?  Generally, the laws of your state give employers the right to enforce this policy, regardless of whether or not the vehicle is parked on the employer's property. It is possible that your state or federal laws provide additional protections, but if the vehicle is on private property, the employer typically has the right to enforce the policy. This could mean that the employee has to stop smoking or go off the property to smoke.
2072	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you?  If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy.  Although this policy may contravene your personal beliefs, it is possible that your state or federal law does not provide sufficient protection if your employer decides to fire you for violating it. Thus, you have two options:  (1) adhere to the policy; or (2) find alternative places to smoke.
2073	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you?  If your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may give your employer the right to enforce this policy.  While it is possible that your state or federal laws may provide some protection, it is likely that your employer has the right to enforce this policy.  This means that you have two options:  (1) stop smoking; or (2) go off the property to smoke.
2074	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you? In most states, the laws give employers the right to enforce their smoking policy, so you may be subject to termination if you violate it.
2075	It is still considered a “right-of-way” violation. The driver with the green light has the legal right of way, regardless of whether they are an idiot or not. Here in the United States, drivers typically use their blinker to indicate a turning motion, which indicates to other drivers that they are losing the right of way on the street they were on.
2076	In some states, it is considered a violation of the right-of-way if a driver enters an intersection while the light is green, even if they had the green light. In New England and other states, drivers often use their turn signals for several blocks before they begin to turn, which indicates to other drivers that they are preparing to turn. This indicates that the driver who had the green light still retains the right of way.
2077	In many states, including New England, the driver with the green light has the right of way. However, here in the United States, drivers often use their turn signals for several blocks before they turn, which indicates their intention to turn. Thus, I wait until the vehicle has begun to turn before I proceed.
2078	In some states, the driver with the green light is considered the one with the right of way; however, this is more of a state laws than an actual rule, as the driver who has the right of way depends on the situation. In most cases, the driver with the green light has the right of way. Here in New England, where I am, drivers often use their blinker to indicate their intention to turn; I usually wait until they start turning, as this is when they lose the right of way on the street they were on.
2079	It is still considered a violation of the right-of-way in the United States, where the driver with the green light has the right of way, regardless of whether the driver is an idiot or not. Here in New England and elsewhere, it is better to wait until the driver has actually started turning, as this indicates that they have decided to turn. Once they turn, they lose the right of way on the street they were on.
2080	Tina is correct that it is important to take steps to protect yourself when using someone else's work. In order to be more defensible, it is best to send a permission request along with a copyright form to the original publisher, as well as an extraction form in case the content needs to be removed. In addition, a disclaimer noting the content's usage can be added to the website for further protection.
2081	Tina is correct that it is best to be cautious when dealing with intellectual property rights. I would advise sending a cease and desist letter to the original publisher, along with a permission form and a copy of the content, in order to obtain permission to use the content. If the publisher does not respond within a reasonable time frame, it may be necessary to obtain the content from another source. Furthermore, including a disclaimer on the website is also advisable.
2082	Dear Tina,   Thanks for the advice. I will certainly take steps to protect myself. I plan to contact the copyright holder and ask for permission to use the material, as well as include a copyright permission form with the content. I will also include a disclaimer on my website to comply with copyright laws.    Regarding the extraction of the content, I will proceed with caution and consider alternatives if the copyright holder does not respond.    Sincerely,  [Name]
2083	Document, be very careful with this. I'm a writer and an ex police officer. These people may have you surgically removing their boots from your own material without permission or payment. To be safe, it's best to send an official certified letter to the original publisher with a permission form and a contract stating the terms of usage. Otherwise, you should be able to extract the info from another source. As a further precaution, it is also a good idea to include a disclaimer on your site.
2084	Tina is right that it is important to take precautions to protect yourself when reusing content. I would recommend sending an official certified letter to the original publisher and including a permission form. It is also a good idea to have a disclaimer on your site.
2085	Because they have not fully thought through their opinions in a comprehensive way. Just like all of us, young people tend to take on the views of their environment, family, and peers. This can lead to an inconsistent outlook, making it difficult to form independent opinions on all issues.
2086	Because they have not thought through the issues thoroughly; many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. This makes it difficult to form an individual view, as there are so many variables to consider. It is difficult to reach a consistent conclusion, as with any issue.
2087	Life is precious, and while it is understandable that individuals may feel differently about certain issues, it is difficult to form an opinion on every issue alone. This can lead to inconsistencies in opinions, especially when we take into account the views of others as well as our own. Ultimately, it is impossible to make a definite judgement on every issue.
2088	Because they have not fully considered the issues involved. Just as all of us are influenced by the opinions of others, younger generations may be more receptive to certain ideas than others. It can be difficult to form a completely individual viewpoint on every issue.
2089	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us, including ourselves, many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. It is almost impossible to think through every issue for yourself as there are so many. Conservatism can mask itself as pro-life, and pro-choice can be seen as inconsistent in some cases.
2090	Yes, I am in favor of it. People argue that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that some predator who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog, but our justice system in Britain is flawed; something needs to be done to provide justice for victims and their families.
2091	I believe that the death penalty is an effective form of punishment in certain cases, as it can act as a deterrent and protect society from serious offenders. Although the justice system in Britain is far from perfect, I believe that introducing the death penalty could be an effective way of ensuring justice is served.
2092	Yes, I am in favour of it. People argue that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that some predator who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog, so why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country? The justice system in Britain needs to be improved in order to ensure that offenders are brought to justice.
2093	Yes, I am in favor of it. People argue that it is barbaric and inhumane, but who can stand up and say that some perpetrator of a crime, such as rape or murder, still has human rights and the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog, but our current justice system is inadequate; something needs to be done.
2094	I believe that capital punishment is an effective form of retribution for the most serious crimes, as it allows justice to be served in a manner that reflects society's condemnation of the crime. Though the justice system in Britain has its flaws, I believe that capital punishment could provide a much-needed deterrent as well as offering justice to victims and their families.
2095	You admitted fault here and I believe that you likely admitted fault in the other case as well. While there may be some differences in the stop sign law between states, it is possible that the failure to yield could have caused a traffic hazard in this case, indicating that the traffic did not have the right of way. This could be why the stop sign violation was ticketed instead of a more serious offense.
2096	The court's decision could have an effect on the underlying situation. In some cases, the court may rule in favor of the defendant, while in other cases the court may rule against the defendant. Both parties should take into consideration the court's decision before deciding their next course of action.
2097	You admitted fault here and I believe that you likely admitted fault in the other incident as well. While the violations in each case may differ, the underlying principles behind stopping at a stop sign and yielding to oncoming traffic remain the same, making it clear that you failed to yield to the other vehicle's right of way. In such cases, it is likely that the court's decision would be upheld. If you were to contest the case, the outcome would likely remain the same. Therefore, it is best to accept the court's verdict without admitting guilt, which allows you to save face while doing so.
2098	You admitted fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too. While it is true that the stop sign rule is sometimes subjective, the law states that drivers must yield to oncoming traffic and it is possible that the court could rule that the traffic light had the right of way, which could lead to a conviction.
2099	You admitted fault here and I believe that you likely admitted fault in the other case as well, as these two offenses are often heard together in court. While the specific wording of the ticket may differ, the underlying offense typically remains the same. Thus, the argument still stands that the driver was primarily at fault in both cases.
2100	I try to teach my children to treat others as you would like to be treated, not simply the way that they do treat you.    As far as I'm concerned, two negatives can make a positive in math, which emphasizes the importance of positive relationships between people.  It is essential to have respectful and caring relationships with others in order to foster a sense of security and belonging.
2101	I strive to teach my children to treat others as they would like to be treated, rather than merely how the other person is treating them.   In my opinion, two negatives can make a positive in mathematics; however, I do not condone torturing anyone or anything, as I believe that such actions are completely unacceptable.
2102	I try to teach my children to treat others as you would like to be treated, rather than the way that they do treat you.   In mathematics, two negatives often make a positive, indicating that negative experiences can lead to positive changes in the future. While it is possible that some people may be open to changes after going through such experiences, it is never acceptable to torture anyone as this goes against our moral values.
2103	I strive to teach my children to treat others the way they want to be treated, rather than the way others actually treat them.   Math can be a helpful tool in understanding interactions between people; however, two negatives do not necessarily make a positive. Torturing others is never acceptable, and I believe that experience teaches us that this is the case.
2104	I try to teach my children to treat others as they would like to be treated, rather than simply treating them how they actually treat others. In math, two negatives can make a positive, indicating that two wrongs can ultimately result in a right. However, I believe torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable; it is my hope that, if faced with it, their beliefs would change.
2105	That is not ideal. Every state has laws in place to prevent felons from accessing firearms. I believe that these laws are important to ensure public safety and uphold the intent of our forefathers. While I agree that every citizen should have the ability to carry a gun for self-protection, this right should not be denied to felons.
2106	I believe in upholding the rights of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms for self-protection. While I agree that felons should not possess firearms, I think it is important to note that these laws were put in place by our forefathers to ensure public safety. As a law-abiding citizen, I was able to obtain a license that allows me to do so.
2107	I believe that criminal background checks are important to ensure public safety, however, I think it is unfair to deny firearm rights to felons even if they have served their sentence. As a law-abiding citizen, I have the right to obtain a license to carry a gun for self-protection, and I was able to do so due to my good standing.
2108	I believe that criminals should be stopped from having access to firearrams, but I also think that law-abiding citizens should be able to defend themselves and their homes. I think that the laws should remain as they are, to preserve the rights that our forefathers fought for. I was able to get a license to carry a firearm, as I am not a felon and I earned the right.
2109	I completely agree that criminals should not be able to possess firearms. However, I believe that crime prevention should be a priority and that citizens should be able to defend themselves and their homes if necessary. It is reassuring that laws are in place that allow citizens to obtain a license and carry a gun, as you mentioned, to protect yourself and your home.
2110	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for workers with disabilities, including mental illnesses. The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals on the basis of a disability, and requires employers to make employees aware of their conditions if necessary. Additionally, the ADA gives individuals the right to sue if their employer violates their rights under the ADA.
2111	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, including mental illnesses such as Bipolar. However, employers are not required to make employees aware of their illnesses prior to employment, as this is not considered reasonable. If an employee is discriminated against because of their illness, they may file a claim with the ADA, which will be reviewed by the agency. If the ADA finds validity in the claim, the employee may receive a ‘right to sue’ letter, allowing them to pursue legal action against the employer.
2112	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in hiring, promotion, or terms and conditions of employment. The ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for an employee’s disability, unless such accommodations would cause the employer undue hardship. Therefore, employers are required to make employees aware of their disability and allow them to request accommodations if necessary. Additionally, the ADA provides individuals with disabilities the right to a trial and the possibility of obtaining a “right to sue” letter if the ADA finds validity in the claim.
2113	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for workers with disabilities, including mental illnesses. This means that employers cannot require employees to disclose their medical information, nor can they deny employment due to the disability. Additionally, the ADA prohibits employers from requiring employees to make their disabilities known prior to employment, as this could result in discrimination.  Employees are also entitled to legal protection from discrimination if employers choose to terminate employment due to the disability. Moreover, individuals may file a claim with the ADA and may be granted a “right to sue” letter if the ADA finds validity in the claim. This allows for legal representation in court.
2114	Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for an employee's disability, unless it would result in an undue hardship on the employer. Mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder are considered disabilities and employees have the right to make their employer aware of their condition. If an employee’s condition is not made known to the employer and they are then fired, the employee may file a claim with the ADA, which will be reviewed. If the claim is successful, the employee may be awarded a “right to sue” letter, which allows them to hire a lawyer and pursue legal action.
2115	I understand that married couples should wait until they are ready to have sex, however, I believe that every couple is unique and needs to determine what is best for them depending on their situation. There are many factors to consider, including the emotional and physical safety of the couple. Every marriage is different and couples must decide what works best for them.
2116	I believe that marriage should be a lifelong commitment, and that it is important to work on a marriage in order to make it successful. There are certain elements which need to be in place for a marriage to work, such as trust and respect, and these take effort to build. I believe that couples should be able to learn from their mistakes and work together to make the marriage successful.
2117	Well, it would have been nice had you used spell check first. Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English. I believe marriage is a lifelong commitment that requires effort and openness to work, and while there are certain aspects that can be studied to improve a marriage, I think it is important for couples to be able to trust each other and have a strong foundation of trust and understanding. I personally believe that continuous open communication and mutual respect are key elements in making a marriage successful.
2118	Well, it would have been nice if you had used spell check first.  Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English.  So my answer to this is, which marriage were you speaking of?  I am on marriage number 3 and at my age it would be foolish to wait too long to marry again.  I know others that are in their 5th marriage; you think they should wait too?  Just exactly how much holier are you than the rest of us?  My previous 2 marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault.  So we should study that aspect more don't you think?
2119	I understand your point; however, in the US, people are encouraged to wait until marriage to have sex, as it can increase the chances of a successful marriage. It is also important to learn and understand the dynamics of a new relationship and be aware of potential issues before taking the plunge. For couples who have gone through such experiences, it might be beneficial to get counseling before tying the knot.
2120	In certain cases, it may be ethical to break the law if people would face serious harm or death, or if the law is designed to discriminate. In these cases, people should consider taking action to challenge the law in order to protect their rights.
2121	I believe that in some cases, it is acceptable to break the law if, in the given situation, not doing so would result in physical harm or death. Additionally, if the law is designed to discriminate, I believe that people must break it in order to challenge it in higher courts, such as when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
2122	I believe it can be acceptable to break the law in certain cases, such as if the consequences of not breaking it could lead to physical harm or death. Additionally, if the law is designed to discriminate, it may be necessary to break it in order to challenge it in higher courts, as Rosa Parks did.
2123	I believe that it is usually acceptable to break the law if, by not breaking it, someone would suffer bodily harm or death. Additionally, if the law is designed to discriminate, I believe that people must break it in order to argue against it in higher courts, such as when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
2124	I think it is generally acceptable to break the law if, in not breaking it, someone would suffer physical harm or death. Additionally, if the law is designed to discriminate, it may be necessary to break it in order to challenge it in the Supreme Court, as Rosa Parks did.
2125	I personally enjoyed Battlefield Earth, despite the poor acting and the lack of action. I enjoyed the thought of the post-war America and the nods to famous cities. While the learning machine does allow the humans to become more intelligent, Travolta gets his comeuppance in the end. I would watch it again if it was on.
2126	I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. Although the acting is not great, the movie has plenty of action and is set in a post-war America. The learning machine allows humans to become intelligent, allowing Travolta to get his comeuppance in the end. I would watch it if it is on.
2127	I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting could be better, but it is a decent sci-fi movie with a good amount of action, and I liked the concept of post-war America. Travolta's comeuppance at the end was satisfying. I'd watch it if it was on.
2128	I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting is not great, but it is a decent sci-fi movie with a good amount of action. I liked the vision of post-war America, with shout-outs to ft hood, knox, and other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent. I tend to watch it when it is on.
2129	I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. While the acting was not great, it was a decent sci-fi movie with an interesting plot about post-war America. I liked the reference to famous cities such as ft hood and knox. I would watch it again if it was on.
2130	In some cases, it can be difficult to define the distinction between pornography and sexually explicit material, as the community's interpretation of what is acceptable can vary. It is important to consider the context of the material, as well as the reactions of the readers, to determine the suitability of the material for a particular audience.
2131	Before anything else, here are definitions according to the Oxford Dictionary:  Pornography: Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.  Explicit: Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion.  It is understandable that some books may be challenged or banned because of its content, even if it is not sexually explicit. It is up to the community to decide if something is pornographic, as the definition of pornography may vary depending on the culture or context.
2132	Before anything else, here are definitions from the Oxford Dictionary:  Pornography: Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.  Explicit: Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion.   I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was ‘pornographic’ when the text is not sexy or titillating – just descriptive (sexually explicit if you will). Some do not even include real descriptions of sex at all.   I cannot find a citation right now, but I have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community.   Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, the community should be able to define both terms.
2133	In some countries, the definition of pornography is determined by the community, as there is no legal or agreed-upon definition. However, pornography is generally considered to be material that depicts explicit sexual activity and is intended to stimulate erotic feelings in the viewer.
2134	Before anything else, here are definitions as defined by the Oxford Dictionary:   Pornography:  Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.  Explicit:  Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion.   I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was “pornographic” when the text is not sexy or titillating—just descriptive (sexually explicit if you will). Some do not even include real descriptions of sex at all.   Communities have the right to define these terms, as pornography is difficult to define in an objective sense without understanding the cultural context and viewpoints of its members.
2135	I believe that regardless of which party wins, some positive policies will be enacted and some negative ones, as well as scandals that are likely to occur. Additionally, the new government's policies may contradict those of the preceding one, which may create a cycle.
2136	I believe that in most cases, no matter which party is in power, some positive initiatives will be implemented and some negative ones will as well. Additionally, there is always the possibility of corruption and scandals due to human nature.
2137	I believe that good things will be done and bad things will be done regardless of which party wins, with a 25% chance of scandals and corruption occurring. However, I do not think that a party's actions are independent of its predecessors, as the new party's actions may cancel out the previous one's. This goes for both parties and the implementation of new projects.
2138	I believe that no matter which party wins power, some good things will be done, some bad things will happen, and there will always be corruption. This is due to the nature of Canadian politics, where one party's policies cancels out what its predecessor has put in place, continuing a cycle.
2139	I think that no matter which party is in power, some good policies will be enacted, some bad policies will be enacted, there is a chance of corruption and scandal and this will continue in a cycle. I also believe that any government will cancel out the previous administration's policies, which can create an ongoing cycle.
2140	Instruments have certain restrictions compared to modern composition software, which can be limiting. Additionally, you cannot control the frequencies of the sounds you make as easily, requiring more time for learning. When playing an instrument, it is more akin to being a soldier than a president, as it requires more effort.
2141	Instruments have limitations compared to composition programs which can limit expression and control of sound frequencies. This can require significant time and effort to learn a single sound, restricting creativity. Although there are benefits to playing an instrument, it may be restrictive compared to composing music.
2142	Instruments have certain limitations compared to composition programs, which can be an issue in the modern musical world. It takes time to learn how to make specific sounds, which limits the creativity of the musician. While it is possible to make music on a computer, it is more restrictive than using traditional instruments. The control over frequencies is also more limited compared to traditional instruments.
2143	Instruments have certain limitations compared to modern composition programs that make them less useful in the modern musical world. Their sounds cannot be controlled as well, and it can take years to learn how to produce a single sound. While it is possible to play instruments, the player is limited to the composer's vision, which is similar to a soldier playing someone else's piece. It is definitely a time investment.
2144	Instruments have certain limitations when compared to modern composition programs, making it more difficult to learn and control the frequencies of sounds. Though it takes time to learn and master an instrument, it is not as flexible as composing music from scratch. In this sense, it is more restrictive than playing an instrument as it limits creativity.
2145	I have always believed that, morally, it is right to kill an animal in order to eat it, as humans have more understanding of death than animals do. Additionally, I think it is acceptable to raise animals for food production, as long as the animals are treated humanely. This is the reason why I am a vegan at the moment, as I dislike the way animals are treated in the meat industry.
2146	I have been struggling with this dilemma for months, and I cannot decide what the right moral choice is. In my opinion, killing an animal for food is morally right as animals do not understand death in the same way as humans, even if it is killed. I also believe that the production of animals for food is ethically acceptable, as long as the animals are treated fairly. I have chosen to be a vegan at the moment due to my concerns about the way the animals are treated by some meat factories. I would welcome any arguments for or against this.
2147	I understand your thoughts and concerns about the treatment of animals in the meat industry. While it is true that animals can be treated inadequately in some cases, it is also true that animals can be treated humanely and with respect in other cases. I believe that the morality of meat consumption depends on the situation. Veganism may be the best option for you, but meat consumption can also be ethical depending on the circumstances.
2148	I understand your dilemma - it can be difficult to make a moral decision when it comes to food production. Killing an animal for food is morally right in some cases, such as with animals which do not understand death. Similarly, if animals are treated right and fairly, then producing animals for food can be ethically accepted. As a vegan, you may have concerns about how animals are treated in factory farms, but there are also ways in which meat can be produced more humanely.
2149	I understand your dilemma and appreciate your willingness to consider both sides of the argument. Killing an animal for food is a moral choice that one should consider carefully. While it is true that animals do not have the same understanding of death as humans, it is important to consider whether the animal had a good life prior to its death and whether the death itself was quick and painless. Generally speaking, when animals are killed for food, it is considered morally acceptable if done in a way that minimizes suffering.  As for producing meat, it is also a moral choice one must consider carefully. Some people feel that killing animals for food is acceptable, while others may believe it is not. If the conditions in which animals are raised are adequate and they are treated well, then it may be considered ethical to produce meat in this way. In addition, the amount of food produced by the animals should be taken into consideration.  Overall, I believe that it is important to consider one’s morals and beliefs when making this decision. It is important to remember that there is no single right or wrong answer. Each person must decide this for themselves.
2150	I believe that attending a commencement ceremony is a personal decision which varies from person to person. For me, attending a commencement ceremony is a way to celebrate the accomplishment and recognize my hard work in completing the coursework. However, due to the nature of my coursework, I do not feel that attending a commencement ceremony is necessary or meaningful for me at this point.
2151	Reason being: -My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelor's is a drop in the bucket in that area as prestige comes when a PhD is reached normally. -It is a normal part of life for people who are serious about a future and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising.  -I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing.  -The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as rigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.
2152	Reason being:  -My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelors is a drop in the bucket in that area as prestige comes when a PhD is reached normally.  -It is a normal event in life for people who are serious about a future and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising.  -The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, so the coursework was not as rigorous as it could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my coursework is frankly embarrassing.
2153	I believe that attending a college commencement ceremony is a normal part of life, with the key factor being the area of study. While a bachelor's degree is a milestone, a PhD is usually necessary to reach prestige in that field. Therefore, while I have completed my coursework, attending a commencement ceremony felt like a bit of a step down for me, as the coursework was not as rigorous as it could have been.
2154	Going to college is an investment in one's future, and I believe that attending a commencement ceremony signifies a milestone achievement that should be recognized. While completing the coursework may not have been as rigorous as expected, attending a commencement ceremony indicates to me that I have taken the effort to finish my studies and am proud of my achievement. I believe that attending a commencement ceremony serves as a source of pride and motivation for continued studies.
2155	After a marriage ends, alimony may be awarded to one partner to help them maintain their lifestyle. This can be difficult for the other partner, who may have to work to support the ex-partner. It is important that both parties consider their choices and options before the divorce, to ensure they make the best decision for themselves and their children.
2156	After a marriage ends, if a prenup was not signed, one partner may be eligible for spousal support from the other. This can cause hardship for the person receiving it, especially if they have to continue to provide financial support to their former partner. It can be difficult to enforce such an arrangement, particularly if the couple has since divorced. I think this can be difficult and unfair for both parties.
2157	After a marriage ends, if a prenup was not signed, the person who did not marry their spouse usually receives alimony from the other. This can be difficult, as the receiving partner is required to continue giving their former spouse money, which could impact their lifestyle. This seems unfair. If the couple had children together, the alimony may be used to help support the kids, but the money may go to an adult partner the couple did not want to be with anymore.
2158	After a marriage ends, if a prenuptial agreement was not signed, one partner is usually entitled to spousal support from the other. I think this is unfair, and it may be difficult for the receiver to maintain employment to pay these support payments. If a person gets a divorce, they may have to take on their former spouse's income to maintain their lifestyle, which can be difficult and expensive. It is important to consider their options before making such a decision.
2159	After a marriage ends, if a prenuptial agreement was not signed, one partner may be required to pay alimony to the other. This can be difficult for the person who must pay, as they may lose assets they earned during the marriage which they may then be forced to give to their ex-partner. This could impact their ability to support themselves.   If a person knows that if they divorce their partner, they may have to make major lifestyle adjustments which could affect their future, they may consider their options and choices more carefully. Alimony can help provide financial support to enable this.  However, this may not be the case in some countries.
2160	Listening to documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. The Melvins have stated that Nirvana were “a bunch of bums who hit the jackpot,” and while other bands in the same region, such as Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, were also talented, Nirvana’s songs have unique and unforgettable melodies with haunting and powerful hooks that set them apart from their peers. Nirvana's songs are truly magical.
2161	Watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. I think the Melvins said they were a bunch of bums who hit the jackpot. While Nirvana's songs may not have been as popular as other songs from the scene, I believe their songs have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and really good pop hooks. Nirvana's songs have a unique quality that stands out from the other bands in the scene. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, but Nirvana still stands out as something special.
2162	Listening to documentaries and books about the Seattle music scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. While I agree that the songs "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Lithium" are particularly memorable and have beautiful melodies and pop hooks, it is clear that there were other great bands such as Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains that were on the same level.
2163	Listening to documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. The Melvins have said that Nirvana were a “bunch of bums that hit the jackpot.” Although I have gone back and listened to a lot of bands such as Mudhoney, Green River, Sonic Youth and others, I must disagree and state that I have not heard anything quite as remarkable as “Lithium” or “Smells Like Teen Spirit”. Both of these songs have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and excellent pop hooks. While Nirvana definitely had a unique sound, I believe there were other great bands of the same caliber such as Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains.
2164	Listening to documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were and how Nirvana were not that special. While Nirvana's songs "Lithium" and "Smells like Teen Spirit" are undeniably magical and have haunting, unforgettable melodies and excellent pop hooks, it is likely that these songs have helped give them more attention than some of their peers. While these songs may have been more popular, other bands such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden were also of a similar caliber in terms of musical skill.
2165	I scroll through Reddit and there are often long sections of comments I cannot fully understand. People quoting and discussing movies, TV shows, and other pop culture is quite common. This can make it difficult to follow the entire conversation at times. Additionally, the ideas discussed in the comments are often dependent on the larger context of the pop culture medium being discussed.
2166	I browse Reddit and there are long sections of the comments I cannot understand. People quoting lines from movies and TV shows, as well as discussing their ideas and opinions on certain topics. This can be interesting at times, but it is frustrating when it happens often, as it makes it more difficult to follow the conversations. It can be challenging to keep track of the ideas and thoughts expressed when the discussion depends on external elements such as movies and TV shows. This can be off-putting at times.
2167	I often browse Reddit and often find long sections of comments that I can't understand. People quote lines from movies and TV shows, which can be intriguing at times. While I appreciate the concept of popular culture becoming part of our shared experience, I feel that ideas should be developed independently, rather than simply approved by a committee of studio executives.
2168	I find the comments on Reddit to be quite dense at times, with people discussing ideas and concepts that originate from other sources. It may be true that some ideas have been approved by a committee, but there is still value in understanding the ideas discussed. People are able to express their own opinions and ideas, albeit through the mediating influence of media and other sources.
2169	I often browse Reddit and there are sections of the comments that I can't understand. People quote each other and whole ideas are sometimes dependent on visual elements in movies, which makes it difficult to grasp concepts on one's own. I think this could be improved by having more original thoughts and ideas which are not dependent on visual elements, but these concepts should be allowed to develop on their own. I believe this could be improved if more people had the opportunity to develop their own ideas.
2170	Using privilege as an explanation for why an individual may have different perspectives or experiences than another can be a valid point to consider in a discussion. However, it is not a valid way to argue someone else's opinions wrong, as experience of privilege can influence one's thinking. It is important to consider these differences in order to have a more meaningful debate.
2171	Privilege can provide an advantage in life that gives people access to resources and opportunities that others may not have. This can lead to a different set of experiences and perspectives. Although an individual’s experience is shaped by many factors, social privilege can give someone an edge in some situations. In terms of debate, this can provide an additional layer of insight that could be valuable in understanding an issue.
2172	In some contexts, privilege can give certain people access to benefits and opportunities that they would not otherwise have, providing them with an unfair advantage. However, this does not mean that the opinions of those privileged are more valid than the opinions of those who have not experienced such privileges. Rather, privilege can be an influential factor that should be taken into consideration when evaluating an issue.
2173	Using privilege as an excuse to dismiss the arguments of others is a valid concern. However, privilege can provide an important understanding of how certain social advantages can influence people's experiences and perspectives. This can be valuable in helping to identify potential biases and give context to an individual's views, which can make it easier to engage in a reasonable debate.
2174	I believe that privilege can be an important factor in understanding an individual's experience, but it is only one factor and should not be used to disregard someone's argument. While privilege may give someone a different perspective on an issue, it does not mean that their opinion is invalid.
2175	This argument fails to acknowledge the important role that hunting has played in the human-animal relationship. In some cases, hunting has been critical in helping maintain a balance in wildlife populations. Moreover, hunters are regulated by laws which make sure that hunting does not exceed the sustainable limits. Therefore, hunters can be just as responsible as conservationists when it comes to preserving animal habitats.
2176	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal habitat and species, which further endangers the existence of wildlife. Anti-poaching initiatives are important to ensure wildlife survival, but it is only a part of the solution - pro-conservation and habitat-protection measures are equally essential.
2177	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the person who disagrees with the idea of anti-poaching initiatives. While poaching is a problem that has existed for centuries, human activity has also had a negative effect on wildlife, with hunting being a major cause of extinction in the past and present. Hunting for profit has had a detrimental effect on wildlife, just like poaching, and anti-poaching initiatives are necessary to limit human influence on wildlife.
2178	This argument ignores the fact that poaching is more often than not done for profit, while hunting is often done for recreational purposes or for food. Poaching is a significant threat to wildlife populations, and hunting can cause species extinction. Both activities threaten animal populations and can cause environmental damage. While anti-poaching initiatives are useful, they alone cannot prevent extinction of species in wildlife.
2179	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Poaching threatens animal populations, often for financial gain, as well as threatening the survival of animal species in wildlife. Anti-poaching initiatives are necessary to protect wildlife and reduce human influence on it, but these measures are not a solution to stopping the extinction of wildlife at the hands of humans.
2180	It is understandable that the use of graphic content in games can lead to desensitization of players to violence. This can have a long-term effect on players’ mental health, especially for children who are more vulnerable to these influences. To counteract this, military trainers have designed simulations which use visuals and sounds to train players on shooting skills. These methods may prove effective in teaching players these skills, but it is still uncertain if this has any impact on player’s aggressiveness.
2181	It is true that video games can depict realistic scenarios which can lead to desensitization in players, particularly when it comes to violent content. However, these games can also provide unique learning opportunities that can be beneficial for some players.
2182	Games like Call of Duty and Battlefield often replicate the same types of scenarios found in police and soldier training simulators, which are designed to teach players reflexive methods of shooting. Even though this may seem realistic, it can have the potential to desensitize players to violence.
2183	It is true that games like Call of Duty and Battlefield offer realistic visuals that mirror the training simulators designed to teach soldiers and police the reflexes needed to shoot people. However, it is also possible that these games desensitize players to violence and death, as some children have access to these games at an early age without adequate parental supervision.
2184	The realism in some video games can be very intense, mimicking the experience of fighting in battlefields or in call of duty-style settings. While it is possible for players to gain rewards and experience points for their actions, these games also allow players to observe depictions of human death and suffering. To gain the players' attention and make them more engaged, game developers have incorporated such elements to make the game more immersive and engaging. Though this can be educational in some sense, it also provides exposure to disturbing content that could potentially desensitize players to violence.
2185	Giving money to third world countries is a better option than donating free rice as it would only provide temporary relief. Money could be used to subsidize farmers of these countries, allowing for cheaper food prices, greater food production and more employment opportunities. This would be more effective than giving free rice.
2186	Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. If rice is freely available to the population, it can cause great harm to local food production and farming of the third world country. Any form of donation should be money, as this could be used to subsidize local farmers, allowing for cheaper food prices, greater food production and more employment opportunities in the country.
2187	I understand the potential benefits of providing free food to a third world country, however, in the long run, this can hinder a nation’s food production and farming industry. If donations are made, money should be given to subsidize farmers in these countries, which can lead to lower prices, greater food production and more job opportunities. This can help ensure the country’s food security in the long run.
2188	Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation is addressed, it could ultimately hinder long-term food production. If a third world nation is supplied with free food, it could hurt local farmers’ ability to produce rice as they compete with the freely available food. Money donations could be used to subsidize local farmers to help keep prices low and food production high, as well as create employment opportunities.
2189	Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. If a third world nation is supplied with free food, it can distribute this food to its people and reduce hunger, which may lead to higher population growth. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood could be damaged by the availability of this free food. If donations are made, they should be financial aid to subsidize farmers of the third world countries, which could allow them to produce more food at lower prices and create more employment opportunities in their food industry.
2190	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you have the drive and determination, you can make it in the world. Case in point: People have made it with their intelligence, like Stephen Hawking, who despite being wheelchair-bound and paralyzed, has still achieved success. Smarts alone are enough to get you far. You can still become successful even if you only have that going for you.
2191	I believe that when we talk about privilege, we often forget about the importance of smarts. We can be physically disabled, such as Stephen Hawking, and still achieve success. Smarts allow us to make use of our potential, as evidenced by Hawking's achievements, even when we have little else going for us. Smarts are a great advantage that can open up many opportunities in life.
2192	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking. He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. Smarts are worthless without motivation and dedication. The will to succeed is a lot more important than just being a smarty-pants.
2193	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. If you have smarts, you can make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking. He was able to succeed despite having motor impairments due to his physical limitations, proving that smarts can be a great asset in life. Though smarts alone are not enough to guarantee success, it is a key factor in achieving a good life.
2194	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts are only part of the equation; motivation and dedication are necessary for success. If you have the drive and determination, along with the smarts, you can make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking, who was able to achieve remarkable success despite his physical limitations.
2195	I believe that a majority vote should be required to make significant changes to a country’s governing structure, such as altering its laws or constitution. To ensure that smaller countries are not left with less power, a two-thirds majority vote should be required to pass these proposals.
2196	I believe that the composition of the Security Council should be more flexible and dynamic. I suggest that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined by a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records) should have the power to block any major decisions. Other countries should also be able to have a say in major decisions, but this should not require a majority vote. I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to pass an issue.
2197	I believe that the composition of the Security Council should remain relatively static to ensure the Council's effectiveness. The five countries with the greatest influence on the world (as determined by a combination of economics, politics, military power, and human rights records) should remain permanent members, with the other seats filled as they currently are. I believe a two-thirds majority should be sufficient to pass an issue.
2198	I believe that no country should have permanent seats and that the seats should be filled based on the five criteria I mentioned. As for the veto power, I think that a 2/3 majority should be enough to enact an action.
2199	I believe that no one should be allowed to have a permanent seat on the security council and that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined by a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records) should have the ability to stay in. Countries that fall too far in any of these areas should be able to remain in their current seats, as well as being able to fill additional seats as needed. I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue.
2200	I do not view suicide as a choice - it is a fight or flight response. Some people cope better than others. My philosophy on the value of life is such that I believe that allowing someone to end their life can be a valid option when suffering becomes too intense and draining of pleasure. Suicide is a deeply personal and emotional decision, and it is understandable why some people may choose to end their life if they feel that life is becoming too unbearable to bear.
2201	This isn't referring to clinical depression, which can prompt suicidal thoughts and urges for years, or even decades in some cases. I do not believe that someone has an inherent value and that preventing someone from ending their life helps society feel more comfortable with death. Although I recognize that there are treatments for depression, I still believe that this can take a toll on someone over a long period of time. Therefore, I believe that people should have the right to decide when they want to end their life if they have reached that point.
2202	I do not view suicide as a choice; it is a fight or flight response. Some people cope better than others. My personal philosophy on the value of life makes me believe that no one has an objective, inherent value and that forcing someone to stay alive can be uncomfortable, particularly when the suffering is so chronic that the pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has experienced years of suicidal behavior, it can become too much to bear.
2203	This is not referring to clinical depression, but specifically to depression that has prompted suicidal thoughts and urges for years. While some people are able to cope with life, others are not, and it can become too much for someone to bear over a long period of time. When this happens, the suffering becomes too much to bear and they feel the need to end their life.  Suicide should be treated as an individual choice, rather than society trying to keep death at bay.
2204	This isn't referring to depression caused by a terminal illness, but specifically to clinical depression which can cause suicidal thoughts for years, decades even. My philosophy on life's value makes me believe that society should not force people to suffer if they are not comfortable with life, even if that suffering extends over a long period of time. Ultimately, it is up to the individual how they choose to end their life, and this should be respected.
2205	I do not want to come off seeming that I'm speaking ill of the dead. I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention.   Marilyn Monroe was an iconic and influential figure in her day and while she may have had her flaws, she is still remembered and admired as a symbol of glamour and beauty. She was certainly noteworthy in her own time and continued to be so decades after her death. While she may not have been as classy and elegant as some of the other stars of her era, she is still remembered as a remarkable figure.   In short, she had her own unique and admirable style.
2206	I think it is important to remember that Marilyn Monroe was a human being, who while she had her strong points, also had weaknesses and flaws like anyone else. While her behavior was inappropriate in some situations, it should not detract from her legacy as a role model. She should be remembered as an iconic figure in her own right, rather than simply judged by modern standards.
2207	I believe Marilyn Monroe has become an iconic figure in pop culture largely due to her performances and her public image, however, I believe her personal life and behavior should not overshadow the positive elements of her legacy. In terms of her marriage and alleged affairs, she was often subject to a double standard due to her gender, which she had little control over. It is important to remember that her behavior was frowned upon at the time, but we should acknowledge the impact she had on changing societal norms.
2208	I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention.  Marilyn Monroe was a talented and iconic actress who has become an iconic figure in popular culture, but she had her issues that hindered her from being a classy, elegant icon. Drug addiction was one of the main causes of her death, and her behavior was likely influenced by this. Although she had a strong presence in her day, she should not be considered a role model for women.
2209	I believe that Marilyn Monroe has an undeniable sex appeal and talent that has earned her a place in the history of entertainment, but her personal life and drug addiction overshadow the positive impact that she had on the industry. Her behavior in professional situations was often reported to be difficult and unstable, which limited the impact of her work and prevented her from being a true role model for women.
2210	I have grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s, while she was Prime Minister, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the status of political prisoners, leading to their deaths. This caused immense public outcry. This, coupled with the decay of Britain's old industries, led to poverty becoming widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. However, recently, I met a man from London who spoke highly of her leadership.
2211	I have grown up in rural Ireland in an area that is patriotic towards the UK. Bobby Sands and other IRA members were killed by the British government during Margaret Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister, leading to widespread public outcry. This caused enormous decay in the country's industries, leading to poverty in Wales, Scotland, and the North of England. People I know from these areas have a negative view of her. However, I recently met a man from London who said he believed her to be a great leader, which I am unable to understand.
2212	I have grown up in rural Ireland in an area that is very patriotic and I have been raised to detest Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80s, when she was Prime Minister, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the status of political prisoners, leading to their deaths, despite strong public outcry. This caused huge decay in Britain’s old industries, resulting in poverty becoming widespread in Wales, Scotland and the North of England. People I know from these areas strongly oppose her policies. Despite this, I recently met a person from London who believed she was a great leader. To me, this is impossible to understand.
2213	I have grown up in rural Ireland in an area traditionally loyal to the Republican cause. During the 1981 hunger strikes, Margaret Thatcher refused to classify Bobby Sands and other IRA members as political prisoners, leading to their deaths. This triggered outrage in the public, and this was exacerbated by the economic decay that devastated industries in Wales, Scotland and North England. I know people from these areas who harshly criticize her. However, I recently met someone from London who praised her leadership. She is often referred to as “The Iron Lady”. I strongly oppose this view.
2214	I have grown up in rural Ireland in an area where patriotism is strong and I have been brought up to dislike Margaret Thatcher. During her time as Prime Minister, there was a sharp decline in Britain's industrial base, leading to widespread poverty in Wales, Scotland and the North of England. This was met with strong opposition from the public. However, despite this, I know people from London who appreciate her leadership and refer to her as the 'Iron Lady'. It is difficult for me to understand this.
2215	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVED the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. They also noted the movie's unique visuals, Ryan Gosling's compelling performance and Cranston's powerful acting. The soundtrack was also well-received, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film. In terms of plot, most of my friends said it was one of the best movies that year.
2216	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Most of my friends liked the movie a lot, with many citing the artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting, as well as Ryan Gosling's performance as a sociopath as highlights. They also thought it was one of the best films of that year. I personally felt that it was a good movie, but nothing exceptional. I found the plot to be somewhat lacking, and felt that the characters were not fleshed out enough. The soundtrack was great, but again, did little to elevate the movie.
2217	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVED the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc.  I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies.  The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning.  The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status.  All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.
2218	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVED the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: the artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting and story, as well as an overall unique and engaging plot.  Gosling's character was very well-developed, and the other actors were excellent, especially Cranston. The soundtrack was also excellent and really added to the emotional impact of the story, making it an even more engrossing experience.  In short, I can see why it was viewed as one of the best films of the year.
2219	I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVED the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. The soundtrack was particularly effective in elevating the movie and making it more memorable. Gosling's character was very well-acted, and the other actors were excellent, especially Cranston. In general, the movie was very engaging and was one of the best films that came out that year.
2220	I am opposed to the use of HFCS as it can cause health issues and has a negative effect on our health and the economy. While it may be cheaper, it is not necessarily better. HFCS can cause obesity, cancer, and other health issues due to the contaminants found in some batches of HFCS. Furthermore, the corn industry is very corrupt, leading to local farmers going out of business, which has a negative effect on the US economy.
2221	I am opposed to the use of HFCS because, while it may be cheaper, it is not better than other sugars. HFCS has been linked to obesity and cancer due to contamination in some batches, and has been shown to cause negative effects on our bodies. It has also had a detrimental effect on the US economy due to the corn industry being corrupt and causing local farmers to go out of business. Tests have also shown that HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical and our bodies do not process them the same way.
2222	I am against the use of HFCS because it can have detrimental effects on health. Tests have shown that HFCS can cause obesity and even cancer, and the FDA does not thoroughly regulate factories that produce it. In addition, our bodies do not process HFCS and cane sugar in the same way. Furthermore, the corn industry has had a negative effect on our economy and the quality of the product.
2223	I am against the use of HFCS due to the negative effects it can have on health and the economy. While it may be cheaper than other sweeteners, it is not necessarily better.  1.) Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity, or even cancer.  2.) Factories that produce HFCS are unregulated by the FDA, and tests have found contaminants of mercury in some batches. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them in the same way. 4.) The corn industry has been corrupted, leading to a negative effect on the US economy.
2224	I am against the use of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) because, in short, it can be harmful to our health. While it may be cheaper than cane sugar, it is not necessarily better.  Experience has shown that HFCS can cause obesity, and some batches have been found to contain mercury, which can be harmful to our health.  Furthermore, the corn industry has been very corrupt and has had a detrimental effect on the US economy.
2225	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which can be a valid point to discuss further. Racism is a complex and often sensitive issue that can have lasting impacts on individuals, communities, and societies.
2226	This happens all the time online and in real life. People might disagree on certain issues regarding race, which can lead to heated debates. Sometimes one person will claim that another person's opinion is "racist", which can be a provocative statement that stops a discussion in its tracks.
2227	It can be difficult to navigate conversations about race, especially when emotions run high. People sometimes react strongly to statements that challenge their perceptions, which can lead to the "that's racist" response. This does not necessarily discredit an argument or observation; it can simply indicate that another person feels their viewpoint is not being respected.
2228	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which can be a valid reaction depending on the context. Race can be a very sensitive issue, and these types of comments can have a lasting impact on a conversation.
2229	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which can be a valid reaction depending on the circumstances. It is a valid response to race-related arguments that cross a line that many people find offensive.
2230	Yes, Bleach is longer than FMA at 160 episodes, although FMA did end at 51 episodes, with some content from the manga being adapted. This allowed FMA to keep a strong narrative flow, while giving it a bit more breathing room compared to Bleach, which could feel like it is dragging at times due to the manga content being adapted. This makes FMA more strong in terms of its narrative. Other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (42 episodes) demonstrate why a limited number of episodes can add great strength to a series.
2231	Sure, Bleach has more episodes than FMA, but the manga is still ongoing, meaning that the show could potentially keep going for a long time. This causes the story to drag in places, as events are extended. FMA's limited number of episodes helps to keep the story strong, as it prevents it from losing momentum over time. Other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann and Flame of Recca show how this limitation can add major strength to a series.
2232	They aren't on the same level. While Bleach is still ongoing and has more episodes, FMA's story arc was contained to 51 episodes, making it stronger in terms of narrative pacing. This is due to the series' limitation which adds strength to its story. Shows such as Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (27 episodes) and Flame of Recca (42 episodes) demonstrate this.
2233	Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga, but when compared to an anime's of a higher quality, the difference in quality is vast. FMA had a strong storyline that remained focused throughout its 51 episodes, which limited the feeling of the story dragging on. Additionally, FMA managed to finish its story arc without feeling like it was stretching on, which adds to its strength. Other anime such as Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (42 episodes) demonstrate this advantage.
2234	They aren't necessarily on the same level. Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga, but when compared to other anime series, the quality is vastly different. FMA's storyline was better structured, as it was limited to 51 episodes, which helps to maintain a strong narrative and prevent the story from dragging on. This is one of its major strengths.
2235	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers, I would argue that eBay is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay’s market closely resembles an internet-based free market where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In other words, this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency. Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in which they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targeting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, which may not be operating at optimum efficiency.
2236	Although eBay serves as a marketplace, allowing suppliers and consumers to directly interact, I believe it is more effective from an economic perspective. eBay operates on a ‘self-targeting’ market which, unlike Amazon, uses consumer demand to set prices. This means that eBay is more efficient than Amazon, which may not be operating at optimal efficiency.
2237	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers, I believe eBay is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market. This allows for a more efficient pricing system where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In other words, this is a self-adjusting market that operates with a higher degree of efficiency than Amazon’s old pricing system.
2238	Although eBay serves as a marketplace, where prices are set by the participants, Amazon uses a slightly different approach, setting prices based on what suppliers specify. This could reduce efficiency, as Amazon may not be targeting prices optimally.
2239	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers, I would argue that eBay is more efficient from an economic perspective. The prices of goods are set by the forces of the market, as buyers pay what they are willing to pay and sellers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. Amazon, on the other hand, used to employ consumer-targeted pricing; they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. This was only stopped after they were caught, and now Amazon is setting prices based on what the product suppliers set them at, meaning they may not be operating at optimum efficiency.
2240	Final Fantasy is better in terms of graphics and storyline. I must admit that Kingdom Hearts has some good features, but the major downside is that you do it all with a key. Furthermore, some Final Fantasy games are turn-based, but this does make the games better. The Final Fantasy trilogy has been out longer and has had a better run than most games.
2241	Final Fantasy is better in my opinion, as it has better graphics and a more engaging storyline. Kingdom Hearts does have some positive features, but Final Fantasy offers more interesting gameplay. Furthermore, some Final Fantasy games are turn-based, which makes it slightly better. Final Fantasy VII is superior in terms of ratings, in my opinion. Also, in Kingdom Hearts II, you can see Tifa and Sephiroth with different names, such as Roxas is the kid form of Cloud. I rest my case.
2242	Final Fantasy is better in my opinion because while Kingdom Hearts does have a good story and gameplay, Final Fantasy has much better graphics and a more fleshed-out storyline. I must admit that Kingdom Hearts does have some features that make it appealing, but the fact that you do it all with a key can be slightly off-putting. Additionally, some Final Fantasy games are turn-based, which can make it better in terms of gameplay. Final Fantasy has had a longer run and has higher ratings than most games. I have played the original Final Fantasy (on the NES) and I can say that Final Fantasy 7 is easily the superior game in terms of ratings. Additionally, in Kingdom Hearts 2, you can see certain characters such as Sephiroth and Cloud, albeit with different names (Roxas is the ‘kid’ form of Cloud).
2243	Final Fantasy is better in my opinion because while Kingdom Hearts does have good features, Final Fantasy offers better graphics and a better storyline. I must admit that Kingdom Hearts does have some good points, but the fact that you do everything with a key is a bit of a disappointment for me. Final Fantasy has been around for longer and has had more success than most games, which is testament to its quality.  The Final Fantasy VII game has higher ratings than Kingdom Hearts in my opinion. Additionally, in Kingdom Hearts 2, you can see Tiphereth and Cloud, but with different names such as Roxas, which makes it interesting.
2244	Final Fantasy is better in my opinion due to its improved graphics and storyline. Kingdom Hearts does have some good features, but its downsides include battling heartless, known as the 'Nobodies', in an empty world as well as its lack of a linear story. Final Fantasy games are typically turn-based, which makes it slightly better. Final Fantasy has been out longer and has had a better run than most games, and I personally prefer Final Fantasy 7 in terms of ratings. Additionally, in Kingdom Hearts 2, you can see Tipha and Cloud, albeit under different names, such as Roxas is the kid form of Cloud. I rest my case.
2245	Arguments about the existence of God are ultimately a matter of faith. While logical arguments can be presented, they can be refuted using logic, as outlined by David Hume's “Matter of Facts.” It is impossible to conclusively prove or disprove his existence, making it difficult to debate his existence or non-existence.
2246	Arguments about the existence of God can be tricky, as there have been logical arguments presented, but these can be refuted through further logic. David Hume's 'Matter of Facts' philosophy states that a matter of fact cannot be proven or disproved, thus making it difficult to prove or disprove his existence. Ultimately, it comes down to faith.
2247	Arguments about the existence of God can be difficult to prove or disprove, as the existence of God is largely a matter of faith. It is impossible to conclusively prove or disprove the existence of God through logical arguments.
2248	Arguments about the existence of God can be an interesting exploration of faith, but it is difficult to prove or disprove his existence using logical arguments. Therefore, it is impossible to definitively prove or disprove his existence through arguments alone.
2249	Arguments about the existence of God can be a difficult subject to prove or disprove. Although logical arguments have been presented, they can be countered with more logic. This is in line with David Hume's idea that it is impossible to reach definitive conclusions about the existence of God, as these debates rely heavily on faith.
2250	Global warming is an issue that affects the entire world, and the United States has a responsibility to help address the problem. As one of the largest CO2 producers, the US should commit to reducing its carbon footprint. This should include reducing emissions to help slow climate change and protect the planet.
2251	Global Warming is an issue that affects the entire world, and the United States should be willing to take a leadership role in addressing the problem. As one of the largest carbon polluters in the world, the US should make an effort to reduce its contribution to the environmental damage caused by climate change.
2252	Global Warming is a global issue that affects the entire world, and America should take the lead in addressing the problem given its large carbon footprint. The US is a leading economic and military power, and could make a significant contribution by reducing its CO2 emissions, which are among the highest in the world.
2253	Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, hence the Global bit. As one of the largest C02 producers in the world, the United States needs to take a leadership role in addressing the issue. President Bush needs to commit that the United States will reduce its carbon footprint in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change.
2254	Global Warming is a global issue that affects the entire world. The United States should take the lead in addressing the problem, particularly given its large contribution to CO2 emissions. The US needs to take concrete steps to reduce its carbon footprint in order to help the planet.
2255	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it can be ineffective and contrary to our moral standards. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy; in the real world, torture provides unreliable information that can be difficult to verify. Additionally, the use of torture could lead to the erosion of our moral standards, which could hamper our efforts to maintain the rule of law and keep our moral superiority over our enemies.
2256	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it can elicit unreliable information and lead to wrongful convictions, which runs counter to our justice system’s emphasis on protecting the innocent. Additionally, torture has been shown to cause severe psychological and physical trauma that can have long-lasting effects on the victim, both mentally and physically. This could lead to unreliable information being obtained, as the victim may provide information in order to end the torture. Furthermore, torture can lead to the victim falsely confessing to a crime out of fear and desperation, which undermines the reliability of any evidence obtained from it.  The “ticking time bomb” scenarios depicted in television and movies are largely fictitious and have not been shown to happen in the real world. Additionally, torture can cause a breakdown in international relations and can set a dangerous precedent, which could lead to a slippery slope of increasingly severe tactics being used.  Thus, it is clear that torture can severely undermine the rule of law and our moral standing, which could hinder our efforts in the War on Terror.
2257	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it can elicit unreliable information, which makes it an unacceptable method for interrogation. All of these “ticking time bomb” scenarios are fantasy; in the real world, torture is ineffective at gathering reliable information. Additionally, the use of torture runs counter to our moral standards and can damage our global standing. We must adhere to international laws and standards in order to remain an ethical and effective force in the War on Terror.
2258	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it does not work. All of these “ticking time bomb” scenarios are fantasy – they do not happen in the real world. Additionally, we as a nation need to maintain our moral superiority and not stoop to the level of our enemies. If we lower our standards, it could jeopardize our ability to uphold our own values.
2259	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is that it can backfire and provide false information, which makes it less effective. All of these “ticking time bomb” scenarios are fantasy right out of Hollywood; in reality, information obtained through torture is unreliable and can be counterproductive. Additionally, torture goes against our values and core beliefs as a nation, and can undermine our moral standing in the world. We must strive to maintain our moral superiority if we want to succeed in the war on terror.
2260	2 reasons:  - Every child has the right to be wanted and loved by their parents, so it is important that the parents feel that bond with their child. Having an abortion might cause psychological issues for the baby in the long-run. - Some parents might not want the baby right away, but they should still be given the chance to raise their child and provide a safe environment for them. Having an abortion could limit the child’s opportunities in life.
2261	2 reasons:  - Having an abortion might be traumatic for the woman, especially if she does not want to terminate the pregnancy. - If a parent does not want the baby, it can cause emotional damage to the child, who may not have the necessary care, nourishment and affection during their upbringing.
2262	1. Every child has the right to be wanted and loved, and having an abortion can be extremely emotionally traumatic for the parent. 2. Every parent should have the option to keep their baby if they want to, and getting an abortion can lead to the child growing up without proper care and nourishment.
2263	2 reasons: - Knowing that you were unwanted can be emotionally difficult for a child to grow up in, and the parent may not feel ready or able to care for the child. It is better to have the option of abortion if the parent is not ready to raise the child. - In some cases, an abortion may be the best option if the parent is not ready or able to care for the child.
2264	2 reasons: - Allowing a baby to be born that is not wanted can be emotionally devastating to the parents and the child. If the parents are not committed to caring for the child, this can lead to a range of problems such as neglect, abuse or malnourishment. - Having an abortion gives the parents more options, which is better for the child. This also provides the parents the chance to take a step back and make sure they are ready to take on the responsibility of parenthood.
2265	The government should take steps to ensure that all citizens have access to basic services, such as healthcare and legal representation, in order to foster a more equitable society. While taxing the wealthy to provide assistance to the poor may be necessary in some cases, it should remain a goal to help the disadvantaged and invest in people's wellbeing.
2266	Having an unequal distribution of wealth between rich and poor can lead to serious issues for society, such as a lack of access to healthcare and political and legal representation. This can lead to social unrest, revolutions, and even dictatorships. It is therefore essential to provide economic aid to the poor and invest in people in order to ensure a healthy society.
2267	Governments should take action to reduce inequality, as without intervention, the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to grow. This can have a negative impact on society, as it prevents people from accessing healthcare and educational opportunities, as well as legal and political representation. Additionally, revolutions often occur when there is a high level of poverty, which can lead to a dictatorship. It is important to invest in people and provide social programmes to give people more opportunities.
2268	We need to intervene to help the poor, as the gap between rich and poor can lead to social unrest. In addition, providing essential services such as healthcare, legal protection and education to the poor is beneficial for society as a whole. Policies which tax the rich more and invest in the people are likely to be more effective than a direct tax increase of 20%.
2269	The poor need help to ensure a healthy and equitable society. Investing in people can help reduce poverty and ensure a more level playing field. Taxation could be used as a tool to help the government provide social services for the poor, such as healthcare, political and legal representation. This can help to reduce poverty and create a more equitable society.
2270	I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV (a program about Tony Blair's legacy) and it made me wonder about this. I believe that if solid legal measures had been put in place to ensure compliance, the benefits of having all seven member states on board would have reduced the adverse effects of engagement and eventual occupation.
2271	I recently watched the parliamentary debate on TV about Tony Blair's legacy, and it made me think. I believe that if binding resolutions had been put in place, the advantages of having all seven member states on board would have mitigated much of the disastrous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2272	I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV (a program about Tony Blair's legacy) and it made me wonder about this. I believe that if binding resolutions had been put in place, the advantages of having the cooperation of all seven member states would have mitigated much of the disastrous outcome of the intervention and occupation.
2273	I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV (some program about Tony Blair's legacy) and it made me wonder. I believe that if the measures had been taken to secure a binding resolution, the additional benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have avoided much of the disastrous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2274	I just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV (a program about Tony Blair's legacy) and it made me wonder about this. I believe that if measures had been taken to secure a binding resolution, the advantages of having all seven member nations on board would have mitigated much of the disastrous nature of engagement and the subsequent occupation.
2275	Recently, engineers have made tremendous progress in creating more efficient diesel engines. This includes engines that offer fuel economy comparable to hybrids, as well as significantly improved environmental emissions. While it is still necessary to rely on fossil fuels to some extent, these advances offer a promising stepping point for the future.
2276	Recently, engineers have been able to significantly improve the efficiency of diesel engines. This includes models that offer higher fuel efficiency than hybrids, with some VW models achieving up to 75 miles per gallon. Moreover, these engines have less harmful emissions than ever before.
2277	Recently, engineers have made great strides in diesel engine technology. The latest diesel engines offer fuel efficiency that rivals hybrids, as well as significantly reduced emissions compared to before. Although it is still a fossil fuel, it is a promising step in the right direction for our energy needs.
2278	Recently, engineers have managed to improve the efficiency of diesel engines, making them comparable to hybrids in terms of fuel economy. This advancement is especially beneficial since diesel engines produce less harmful emissions than before. Additionally, the emergence of hydrogen fuel technology offers promise for the future.
2279	Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. Now, it offers superior fuel efficiency and emissions standards compared to before. Additionally, it is able to rival hybrid vehicles in terms of mileage, such as the Toyota Prius. Though it is better to diversify our energy sources, these advancements in diesel technology offer a promising step forward.
2280	Rugby is a great sport that offers a combination of running and wrestling, with constant action and no time-outs or dead plays. Every position can score and every body type is able to participate, making it more open and enjoyable for all. Additionally, Rugby lacks pads which allows for hard hits that are skillfully executed. The force of the hits is not dampened by armor.
2281	Rugby is a great sport that combines running, tackling and defending with continuous action. It appeals to all types of athletes as any position can score and any body type can fit. This makes the sport more open and enjoyable for everyone involved. Furthermore, rugby does not use pads which adds to the skill of the hits, making the action more intencis.
2282	Yes, I believe that Rugby is the superior sport for several reasons.  1) Rugby combines the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling, with constant action and no time-outs or dead plays. 2) Every position can score and every body type has a position, making it more open and enjoyable for everyone. 3) No pads means that the hits are just as hard, with skills being just as complex and impressive as the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Rugby in the raw.
2283	Rugby is an exciting sport that combines running and wrestling, with continuous play and action. It is more open and accessible to all players and spectators, due to the fact that any position can score and any body type can fit into the game. Moreover, the absence of armor provides a great challenge when it comes to the physical impacts of the hits.
2284	Rugby is a great sport that offers a unique combination of running, wrestling, and attacks. It is also more open and enjoyable for all players and competitors due to the lack of pads. Additionally, the physicality of the hits and the skill of the players are equally impressive, with no time-outs and no dead plays.
2285	The health benefits of coffee are not as well-established as those of marijuana, which has been used for many health benefits for over 5,000 years, with its active ingredient THC. Coffee, while having a stimulant effect, does not have the same medical benefits as marijuana.
2286	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits, however, marijuana has multiple potential medical benefits, such as reducing inflammation and improving symptoms of various ailments. Additionally, marijuana has been used for many health benefits, whereas coffee's primary benefits are as a stimulant and its taste.
2287	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits, keep in mind that being a stimulant and tasting good is not a medical benefit. On the other hand, marijuana has many health benefits. The main active ingredient, THC, has been used for many medical applications for over 5,000 years, while the stalk, leaves, and seeds of marijuana have been used to produce rope, canvas, clothing and other materials. Marijuana places higher on the medical scale than coffee.
2288	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits, keep in mind that being a stimulant and tasting good is not a medical benefit. On the other hand, marijuana has many health benefits, as THC has been used for many years for a variety of applications. Moreover, the stalk, leaves, and seeds of marijuana have been used to manufacture rope, cloth, and other materials as well.
2289	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits, keep in mind that being a stimulant and tasting good is not a medical benefit. On the other hand, marijuana has numerous health benefits, as it has been used for over 5000 years to treat a variety of ailments, as well as its ability to create textiles, rope, and paper from its different components. Therefore, marijuana places higher value than coffee.
2290	I agree that forcing individuals to contribute to charities without their consent is an issue that needs to be addressed. There are many ways this could be achieved, such as setting up voluntary support associations with reasonable criteria for support or providing tax breaks to those who contribute to a recognized charity. There should be some flexibility to allow individuals to decide which causes they feel most strongly about.
2291	I believe that these decisions should be made by the individuals or their families, rather than the government. Setting up voluntary support associations is a good idea and tax breaks could be offered to those who have contributed in the past. Additionally, providing insurance benefits may be restricted to those who have already contributed. This would allow people to decide for themselves which charities are worthy of their support.
2292	I believe that it is important to provide support for those in need, and that this should be done on an individual basis, rather than through a centralized system. This could be done by setting up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for support applicants, such as those who are in the process of trying to get a job or education. Tax breaks can then be offered to those who have contributed in the past. Insurance benefits could be provided only to those who have already contributed. It is ultimately the decision of the government to decide which causes are worthy of support.
2293	I believe that the responsibility of providing aid to those in need should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Setting up voluntary support associations with reasonable criteria for support is a viable option, as it allows individuals to contribute based on their own circumstances. Tax incentives can be provided to those who have contributed to recognized charities, which allows the government to reward those who have already done so. Requiring those who have received aid to pay it back could be an option as well. Ultimately, it is the individual’s decision as to what is a worthy cause.
2294	I think that it is important to provide support for those in need, and while I believe that individuals should have the right to decide where their money goes, it is also important to ensure that contributions are made in a manner that is both effective and voluntary. To do this, charities and support associations should be set up to provide aid and ensure that it reaches those in need, with reasonable criteria in place for those seeking aid. Tax breaks could be offered to those who contribute, and insurance benefits could be provided to those who have contributed in the past.
2295	College athletes do receive financial aid in the form of scholarships. Going to college costs money, and if the athlete is good enough and maintains a GPA, they receive these scholarships which serve as debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1,000 and using it to pay a credit card versus a scholarship of $1,000. The question here then is not whether or not college athletes receive financial aid, but should college sports be profit-oriented? If it is a state school, the answer is automatically no.
2296	College athletes do receive financial aid in the form of scholarships, which serve as debt relief. Depending on their academic performance and performance on the court/field, they can receive scholarships. This is no different than receiving a check for $1000 and using it to pay for tuition and other related expenses. The question then becomes whether college sports should be profit-oriented or not; if it is a public university, the answer is automatically no.
2297	College athletes do receive financial aid in the form of scholarships, which serves as debt relief for their families. Attending college costs money, and if the athlete is good enough and maintains a GPA, they will receive these scholarships. In essence, the money is used in a similar way to a payment of a $1,000 check or a scholarship. The question then is not whether or not college athletes receive financial aid, but whether college sports should be profit-oriented. If it is a state school, the answer is automatically no.
2298	College athletes do receive financial aid in the form of scholarships, which helps pay for their education. The scholarships are essentially debt relief that covers some of the cost of attending college. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 and using it to pay for tuition and a scholarship for $1000; the question then is not whether or not college athletes receive aid, but whether college sports should be profit-driven. If it is a public school, the answer is automatically no.
2299	College athletes do get paid in the form of scholarships, as education is a major expense. Scholarships help offset the costs of education, just as a financial aid check would. While there may be a difference in the amount of the scholarship and the cost of tuition, the principle is the same. Therefore, the question is not whether college athletes get paid, but whether college sports should be profitable.
2300	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear, which is a form of terrorism. As noted in the news article, the group targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. We cannot limit our concept of terrorism to Islamic radicals; any group that commits such attacks should be considered a terrorist organization.

As noted in the news article, the group targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and Vail Ski Resort in 1998.

As noted in the news article, the group has targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, and Vail Ski Resort. We cannot limit our concept of terrorism to Islamic radicals; any group that uses violence to strike civilian targets for the purpose of sending a message or spreading fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
2304	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By targeting civilian areas, the group meets the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the group firebombed forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort.  We must broaden our definition of terrorist to include any organization that uses violence to achieve its aims.
2305	Just like other private schools, religious schools receive money from their students, which goes directly to them and is not subsidized in any way. This money is different from public schools, which must rely on community fundraisers and events to receive financial support. Although this money may go to a private institution, it is difficult to know for certain how it will benefit the students.
2306	Just like other private schools, religious schools receive funding from their own pupils’ tuition fees which goes directly to them and is not subsidized by the government, unlike public schools which have to use community fundraisers and events to get financial support.  The money given to private institutions is similar to giving money to a stranger and asking them to use it for the benefit of the students.
2307	Just like other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own students' fees which goes directly to them and is not subsidized in any way, unlike public schools which rely on community fundraisers and events to get financial support. While this money is given to private institutions, it is difficult to know how it will benefit the students.
2308	Like other private schools, religious schools receive money from their own students, which goes directly to them and is not subsidized in any way. Additionally, public schools rely on community fundraisers and events to receive funding, making it difficult to know where the money will go and how it will benefit students.
2309	Just like other private schools, religious schools earn money from their own students' tuition fees, which goes directly to them and is not subsidized in any way unlike public schools, which have to rely on community fundraisers and events to get the necessary funds. The money given to these institutions is similar to giving money to a stranger and asking them to use it for the students' benefit; it is difficult to know how the funds will be used and whether it will truly benefit the students.
2310	I understand that cutting a child's hair may not be the most effective way to discipline them, as it may not teach them a valuable lesson. However, if parents can properly discipline their child, punishment is not necessarily required. There are better ways to help children learn their actions were wrong.
2311	I believe that cutting a child's hair as punishment could be counterproductive, as it does not necessarily teach them any valuable lessons. If the parent is able to properly discipline the child, other forms of punishment can be used instead. Additionally, there are better ways to ensure that the child understands the consequences of their actions.
2312	I believe there are better ways to discipline a child than cutting their hair, as this may not teach them an important lesson. If the parent is able to discipline their child, there is no need to cut their hair as punishment. There are better methods to help them understand their actions were wrong.
2313	I do not believe that cutting a child's hair is an effective way to discipline them or teach them a lesson. Disciplining a child is important, but hair cutting is not the most effective method. There are better ways of teaching children the consequences of their actions.
2314	Ideally, discipline should focus on teaching children the values and behaviors that are important to the family. Cutting a child's hair as punishment may not be the most effective way of teaching a lesson, as it depends on the situation. There are other forms of discipline that can be more effective in conveying the message that the parent or guardian wants to communicate.
2315	Criminal gangs present a danger to the population, and law enforcement must be allowed to protect citizens from them. Regular citizens may take up arms to protect themselves if necessary, though this is not desirable. Therefore, police must be allowed to do their job and keep the public safe.
2316	The police should be allowed to take action to protect citizens from criminal gangs, as this is essential for public safety. While it is understandable that citizens may take measures to protect themselves in such situations, this is not beneficial for the rule of law.
2317	The authorities must be allowed to protect citizens from criminal gangs, in order to ensure the rule of law. Otherwise, citizens may take matters into their own hands, which is not desirable.  This should be the priority of the police, as it ensures public safety.
2318	Criminal gangs can pose a risk to society, so it is important for police to be able to take action to protect the public. While this is understandable, it could challenge the rule of law if the police are not allowed to do their jobs. Therefore, it is important for authorities to be able to take action to keep citizens safe.
2319	Gangs can pose a significant threat to public safety, and while the police must be allowed to take action to protect the population, it is important that the rule of law is upheld. Therefore, governments must ensure police forces are able to act when needed.
2320	I was slightly disappointed with my experience at Pho. I had been going to a ramen place down the street and always leave full and happy, so I preferred ramen over Pho. However, the ramen at Pho was not as good as the ramen at the other place.
2321	I was somewhat disappointed with the food at Pho restaurant. I usually enjoy Ramen a lot more and feel satisfied after eating it. However, I prefer Ramen over Pho any day.
2322	I was somewhat disappointed with the restaurant. I have been regularly visiting a ramen place nearby and have always left feeling satisfied and happy. However, when I tried Pho, it failed to meet my expectations. I would personally choose ramen over Pho any day.
2323	I was slightly disappointed with the Pho place compared to the ramen place I have been going to for a while, as I always leave feeling satisfied and happy. Although I prefer ramen over Pho in terms of flavor, the latter is still a great option for me.
2324	I was slightly disappointed with Pho after visiting it after hearing the hype about it. Ramen is usually my go-to choice and I prefer it over Pho any day. The egg rolls were the only thing that I enjoyed.
2325	This place was fairly quiet, with only a few people present. The server was friendly and attentive, however, the food options were limited with the sour cream being unavailable. Service was slow for a weekend night.  We had a good time overall, although we probably won't be returning for the next girls night.
2326	This place was decent. The staff broke up a fight around 11pm, which was a bit unusual for a Friday night. However, the taco selection was limited, which was strange. Service was a bit slow for a weekend night.  We still had a good time, mainly due to the company we were with. We might not return for the next girls' night out.

2330	I have been ordering from #109 for over 10 years, as our house number ends with 4949. In recent months, the employees have become increasingly rude when they cannot hear what I am saying. Today, around 4:59pm, the manager of the store answered the phone in a very disrespectful manner. This is the fourth time this has happened. We have decided to switch to Papa John's, as their employees are professional and friendly. We hope they close this store down, as we do not know what they might put in our pizza.
2331	My family and I have been ordering from # 109 for over 10 years, and recently our experiences with the staff have been less than pleasant. On multiple occasions, the staff have been very disrespectful when I am unable to hear them. In addition, the manager from two months ago must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. We have decided to switch to Papa John's, as their employees are more professional and friendly.  We hope that the store closes, as we do not know what they might put in our pizzas.
2332	My family and I have been ordering from #109 for over 10 years. Our house number ends in 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, am calling from my cell phone. Recently, the employees have become far more disrespectful when I am unable to hear what I am saying. This is the fourth time this has happened.   We recently experienced an order mistake from them and the employees were trained to be much more disrespectful. We decided to switch to Papa John’s as their employees are more professional and friendly. We hope they close this store before something worse is added to our pizzas.
2333	My family and I have been ordering from #109 for over 10 years, and recently our experience with their employees has been very disrespectful.

I hope they close this store, as we would rather go with another option where we know the food quality and safety will be higher.
2334	My family and I have been ordering from #109 for over 10 years, and recently the customer service has been declining. The employees are now very disrespectful when they cannot hear what I am saying, and this has happened multiple times. Additionally, two months ago, they messed up our order. I called to complain and the manager who was present seemed to have trained the employees on how to act and speak in an unprofessional manner. We have decided to switch to Papa John's, as their employees are more professional and friendly. I hope the store is closed before something bad happens - who knows what they might put in our pizza.
2335	I have usually had a positive experience here in the past, however, on this occasion I was disappointed with the service. The food was fine, but I was bothered by the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server, which may prevent me from returning for a while. Additionally, the server took our drink and dinner orders simultaneously, rather than taking the drink order first and letting us look at the menus. This was on a Saturday night, which could indicate insufficient staffing.
2336	I have had a positive experience at this restaurant in the past, however, on this visit I was disappointed with the service. The food was fine, but I was bothered by the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server, as well as the slowness of the bussing of tables. Furthermore, the server took our drink and dinner orders at the same time, which was bothersome, since the restaurant was still crowded even though it was a Saturday night.

2339	I have usually had a positive experience here in the past, but my most recent visit was disappointing. The food was fine, but I was irritated by the server's lack of attentiveness and slow bussing of tables, as well as the fact that drink orders were taken simultaneously with dinner orders, which was unpleasant. I'll be hesitant to come back for some time.
2340	I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. It's family-owned and the owners are very personable with their customers. They take the time to have conversations with you while your order is being prepared--and let me say that their ingredients are so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite, as well as their Horchata. My go-to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or their Chicken Chimichangas. You can't go wrong with this place. I would eat there every day if I could. If it's your birthday, they'll give you the food for free--I always forget to take advantage of that, but I don't mind paying for it.

2345	We were disappointed in our experience at the bar. The bartender was rude, short and immature. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and we understand why. We asked for chips and salsa, and she said they only have nachos. We ordered quesadillas and asked for sour cream and salsa, which she brought for us. We found it strange that they don't serve chips and salsa, so we asked her about it. Her response was that it's not on the menu, which was surprising to us. We suggested she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, but she told us that it wasn't feasible. We are aware that service should be a priority in the industry, but we found her attitude to be confrontational. We will never go there again.
2346	We were a bit surprised by the bartender's attitude. She was short with us and seemed to be annoyed by our questions, which was disappointing since we were there to enjoy our meal.

2347	We were a bit surprised by the bartender's attitude, given the lack of customers at the time. We found the atmosphere and service to be lacking compared to other establishments. We will definitely be avoiding this bar in the future.

We told her we could have asked them to throw chips and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, but she responded that it was not her job. We felt very uncomfortable and will never return to this restaurant again.

There were only a few other people there despite it being a Saturday evening, and I can understand why.    We asked for chips and salsa, but the bartender said they only have nachos. We ordered quesadillas and asked for sour cream and salsa, which she eventually brought out. It was somewhat unclear if they had salsa, so we asked her about it. Her response was that it's not on the menu - I suggested that she should go into the kitchen and ask them to just throw chips and salsa in separate bowls and bring them out, but she told me I was being confrontational.  I am in the service industry and was just trying to help her out, but she seemed uninterested in making an effort.     We will never return there in the future.
2350	We recently went to the Mac & Cheese for drinks. Our friend said the food was excellent and she got some wings to go since her partner loves them. The outdoor seating was nice, although on that day they allowed some children to come in, which was a bit of a distraction. Other than that, I think it is a cool and chill place to hang out and drink.

2355	Schools should try to foster creativity and individuality in children as they are still growing, as this is important for their development. However, it is also important for schools to provide structure and guidance to ensure that children’s creativity is not hindered.
2356	Schools should provide a supportive environment which allows children to develop their creative abilities and explore their individuality. Attempting to restrict this expression, which is still quite malleable, could be detrimental to children's growth.
2357	Schools should strive to foster the creativity and individuality of children by providing an environment that encourages exploration and learning, rather than hindering it. This could involve allowing children to express themselves in ways that may be considered non-conventional at their age.
2358	The last thing schools should do is curtail the creative expression and individuality of children, as this can hinder a child's development. Schools should instead create an environment that allows children to explore their own identity and foster their unique qualities.
2359	The last thing a school should do is limit the creative expression of its students, as this can hinder a child's development. Children's individuality should be encouraged and nurtured by schools to allow them to flourish.
2360	It does not show kids' expressions and uniforms can make it difficult to identify individuals, which can limit the effectiveness of the image recognition algorithms.
2361	It does not show kids' expressions and uniforms can sometimes make it difficult to tell the age and identity of the person in an image, which can impact the accuracy of the AI models.
2362	It does not show children's expressions and uniforms may not show details clearly, which can affect the child's learning experience.
2363	It does not show children's expressions, and uniforms can make it difficult to distinguish characters, which can limit the viewers' ability to follow the story.
2364	It does not show children's expressions and uniforms can sometimes make it difficult to identify the child in the image, which can be an issue for some parents.
2365	Wearing a school uniform by high school students can cause tension between students and teachers, as well as issues with student freedom. Parents and teachers need to control this behavior, which should be done in childhood, rather than when students become adults. This can be difficult as school uniforms restrict student's freedom.
2366	I believe that school uniforms can be an issue for students aged 16-18, as it limits their freedom and creates friction with their parents and teachers. Control over student behavior should be implemented in childhood, rather than when the students become adults.
2367	Wearing school uniforms by high school students can create tension between students and teachers, as well as cause conflicts between students and their parents and teachers. Schools must control students' behaviour, but this should be done gradually as students become adults.
2368	Wearing school uniforms by high school students can be an issue, as students aged 16-18 may not be comfortable with restrictions on their freedom. This can lead to tensions between students, parents and teachers. It is important to ensure that control is in place in order to nurture student behaviour at an earlier stage.
2369	I believe that requiring school uniforms from high school students can create tension among the students, teachers, and even the parents and students themselves. While limits must be set for the students' freedom, this can sometimes lead to disagreements. Additionally, controlling a student's behavior should be done during their formative years, rather than when they become adults.
2370	Wearing a school uniform does not necessarily mean better learning at school. School is for students to learn and prepare for the future, not to simply waste money on a uniform. There is generally no direct correlation between wearing a uniform and school results.
2371	Wearing a uniform does not necessarily mean improved learning at school; students go to school to learn and prepare for their future, not to waste money on a uniform. There is no connection between wearing a uniform and school results.
2372	Wearing a school uniform does not necessarily mean better learning at school as students go to school to learn and prepare for their future, not to waste money on a uniform. While there may be no direct connection between wearing a uniform and school results, school uniforms can promote a sense of unity and discipline among students.
2373	Wearing a school uniform does not necessarily mean better learning outcomes at school; students go to school to learn and prepare for their future, not to waste money on a uniform. There is no direct connection between wearing a uniform and school results.
2374	Wearing a school uniform does not guarantee better learning outcomes at school; students go to school to learn and prepare for their future, not to waste money on a uniform. While school uniforms may promote a sense of unity and identity among students, there is often no connection between wearing a uniform and school results.
2375	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has significant memory leaks has likely not experienced it first-hand. The only memory issues I have encountered are when opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (a known issue, which a simple restart resolves).  Furthermore, in comparison to Firefox 2, IE 7 has less features overall, thus reducing its advantages earlier versions had (flexible toolbars and customizable buttons being two examples).
2376	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks has likely experienced them; I have found that Firefox's memory issues occur when opening multiple windows or when leaving the browser active for several hours. This is a known issue that can be remedied by restarting the browser.  IE7 has added features that favor it over Firefox, such as the flexible toolbars and customizable buttons.
2377	While Firefox 2 may have some memory issues under certain conditions, these issues are manageable in day-to-day usage. Additionally, memory leak problems tend to be resolved with restarts. Furthermore, memory leak issues generally arise only when a large number of tabs are opened or when the browser has been left active for a long time, both of which are known issues.  Thus, while Firefox 2 may have some memory issues, these are not considered to be significant in everyday use.  In comparison, features taken away from earlier versions of Firefox were integrated into IE7, indicating that IE7 has fewer advantages compared to earlier versions of Firefox.
2378	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks may be right; I have only experienced memory issues with Firefox 2 when opening multiple windows or after leaving it active for several hours. This is a known issue that can be solved by restarting the browser.  IE7 has gained additional features compared to earlier versions, which has negated some of Firefox's advantages. These include flexible toolbars and customizable buttons.
2379	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks may be correct; however, the amount of memory used can increase with high usage, such as with multiple windows open or after prolonged inactivity. This is a known issue that can be resolved by restarting the browser.  Additionally, while Firefox 2 improves upon earlier versions, IE 7 has features removed from them that were useful in earlier versions.
2380	Firefox offers more customization options than IE, as users can customize its appearance and add functionality as they choose. Additionally, Firefox is proven to be faster and safer than IE, with its emphasis on security making it a better choice in terms of safety. Furthermore, its name is more original than IE's.
2381	Firefox has numerous advantages over Internet Explorer. It is proven to be safer, faster and more customizable, with the ability to adjust its look as desired and add any functionality users desire. Moreover, its name is more original than IE's.
2382	There is no clear preference between Internet Explorer and Firefox. Firefox offers more customization options, such as its ability to change its appearance and add extra functions, and is generally faster and safer. It also has a more unique name than Internet Explorer.
2383	Firefox offers more flexibility and customization options than IE. It is also faster and more secure, and users can easily adjust its look and feel to suit their preferences. Additionally, Firefox has a more distinct name compared to IE.
2384	In terms of performance and safety, Firefox is the clear winner. It is faster and offers more customization options than Internet Explorer. Additionally, Firefox has a more aesthetically pleasing name and user interface.
2385	I understand her decision to tell me about it. It takes courage to open up to someone about something like that, and I am grateful that she felt comfortable sharing it with me. If something like that ever happened, I would be there for her and make sure she feels supported.
2386	I understand that these types of mistakes can be difficult to experience, however, I feel that she took the courageous step of confiding in me, which shows her strength and growth as a person. I would support her if something like this were to happen again, as I believe sharing these experiences helps us learn and grow.
2387	I believe it is important to be open and honest with each other, especially when it comes to mistakes. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people would do. I would definitely be there for her and provide my support.
2388	I understand her decision to tell me about it. It takes courage to open up and share something like that, which is not something everyone would do. I would be there for her and support her, should that happen. I believe in her strength and that she would learn from it, if it were to happen.
2389	I think it's commendable that she was open and honest with me about it. It takes strength and courage to be open in that situation and I will always support her if that were to happen. I believe she has learnt from it and I will be there for her, whatever choice she makes.
2390	If my spouse committed murder, I would do everything possible to ensure that he does not get caught. I would help him hide evidence and dispose of any physical evidence if necessary. I would move if necessary to ensure that neither of us is brought to justice. It would be difficult to turn my loved one in.
2391	If my spouse committed murder, I would do everything possible to ensure their safety and keep them from legal consequences. I would help them evade law enforcement and create an alibi, if necessary, and I would not disclose the information to their partner.
2392	I would do everything I could to protect my spouse if they committed murder. I would help them hide evidence if necessary, relocate if necessary, and I would never bring it up to their attention again. I would feel it is my responsibility to stand by them and help them in whatever way I can.
2393	If my spouse committed murder, I would do everything possible to ensure their safety and that of our family. I would help them evade authorities, if necessary, and I would not bring the situation to my spouse's attention unless absolutely necessary.
2394	If my spouse committed murder, I would try to provide emotional support and help them evade law enforcement, relocate if necessary, and not bring it up to their attention again. I would do whatever I could to support them, as murder is a serious crime with harsh penalties.
2395	I believe that books provide more benefits than television, as books enable readers to learn more and use their imaginations, while television shows often contain less educational content and relies more on visual effects.
2396	I believe that books can offer an enriching experience, while television can be an excellent source of entertainment and education. However, television can be more engaging and interactive than reading a book, which can make it more appealing to some people.
2397	I believe that books offer a unique and invaluable experience compared to watching TV. Books provide an opportunity to use the imagination to create characters and stories, which can help people better understand the world around them. TV often offers a more passive experience, which can be beneficial in some cases but is less engaging than reading.
2398	Books offer the chance to learn new information and gain knowledge, while TV is mainly a visual medium that can more quickly engage the viewer and provide an entertaining experience. Both mediums have the potential to provide educational content, but books generally provide more opportunity for in-depth learning.
2399	Although books offer a unique experience when compared to TV, it is true that television has the potential to engage viewers more quickly than books due to its visual elements. This suggests that books can be more mentally engaging than TV, as books have the ability to stimulate the mind more than TV.
2400	First of all, India has the potential to make a great impact on the world, given its population and human capital. Although some Indian individuals have succeeded in gaining Nobel prizes abroad, other talented individuals are being forced to leave their potential untapped due to the lack of opportunities in India, resulting in a slowdown of social mobility.
2401	First of all, India has the potential to make a greater impact on the world in terms of economy, education, and culture, due to its large population and young workforce. While there have been some Indian people who have achieved success in other countries, many talented individuals in India face restrictions that prevent them from reaching their full potential. This restricts the growth of the Indian economy and prevent India from making a greater mark on the world stage.
2402	India has the potential to be a global leader, as evidenced by the many Nobel Prizes won by Indian people and the success of some Indian individuals. However, the lack of opportunity and social pressure to remain in the status quo can be a barrier to success.
2403	India has the potential to make a strong impact on the world economy, especially given its large and talented workforce. Although India has made progress in recognizing the potential of its people and allowing them to succeed, there are limits to the opportunities available, which can lead to brain drain and poverty. This can hinder India's ability to compete on a global scale.
2404	In India, the lack of access to quality education and other opportunities has prevented many individuals from reaching their full potential. This has led to a situation where India does not have enough individuals who are competing globally and thus, India’s ability to lead the world is hindered.
2405	Growing up without a father can cause feelings of emotional pain, as you may question where he is and what he is like. While this can make an impact on trust and your relationship with him, it is possible to come to terms with this over time. Knowing your father is there can still be beneficial, as you build relationships with him over time.
2406	Having a father who is physically present may be reassuring, but it does not necessarily alleviate the loss of knowing your father since childhood. It is possible to have a sense of loss regardless of whether or not the father is present in your life, as you may feel a greater connection with him if you knew him as a child.
2407	Growing up without a father can be difficult, as you may not have the sense of security and understanding that comes with having a father figure in your life. However, having a father who is physically present can help you to better cope with any heartache from his absence, as you would know that he is there for you. Knowing your father can provide a sense of security and understanding that can help you to feel more secure in your relationship with him.
2408	Having an absentee father can cause heartache, as you might not know him and might not trust him fully. However, some people believe that just having a father in their lives can provide comfort, even if he is physically absent. I believe that the absence of a fatherly relationship can be hard, as you miss out on knowing him and learning about him.
2409	Having a father who is physically present is important, but it is not the same as having a father who is emotionally present and able to build a strong relationship with you. Knowing your father is there can provide a sense of security, but it can be upsetting if he comes and goes in your life. For me, it is better to have a father who is always in my life from the start, rather than having an uncertain relationship with him.
2410	Having a father figure is important in a child's life, but having a father who is present and engaged can be even more beneficial. While having a father is important for a child's development, being fatherless allows a child to create an image of their father that they want and to become a better person and father.
2411	Being fatherless can have its advantages; it gives you the freedom to imagine your father however you want, which can make it easier to develop a stronger relationship with your own personal vision of a father. This can give you more freedom and a better understanding of parenting.
2412	Having a father who is present and engaged is certainly preferable to having an absentee father, as it gives children more stability and emotional support. However, having a father who is 'imagined' and is a source of support and guidance can also be beneficial, as it can help to shape the child into a better person and father figure.
2413	Growing up without a father can have an effect on a child, but I believe it gives the child more freedom and control to create the father figure they want in their head, which can ultimately make them a better person and a better parent.
2414	This argument could go both ways, but I would agree that having a father figure is better than having none. You have the ability to imagine your father however you want, which can give you a sense of security and stability that can help you become a better person and father figure.
2415	I think having a father that is not present can be more emotionally difficult than having a father that is not around. However, if I had to choose between the two, I would prefer to be fatherless as it is easier to cope with than having a lousy father and not having them there to support me.
2416	I think both being fatherless and having a lousy father can be difficult. However, for me, I would prefer to be fatherless as it is still better to have a father not present instead of having an unsatisfactory relationship with him. This is because I am in the middle of these two choices, as my father left the country but it still hurts me that he is not here to support me.
2417	I think it is sad to have a father who is not present in your life, either due to death or other circumstances. However, it is better to have no father than to have a lousy father who is not there for you emotionally.
2418	I think it is definitely more difficult to have a lousy father than to be fatherless, as it is painful to not have a father present and have that relationship missing. It is harder to come to terms with that than being fatherless, since you know that a parent not being there can be a difficult situation. However, it is still a choice between the two, since your father is not here but is reasonably present in your life.
2419	I think it is better to be fatherless, since at least then you know that not having a father is a reason why he is not around. It would hurt me more if I had a father, but he was not present due to a reason. I understand his decision to leave the country, although I need his support.
2420	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he changed rules and concepts that Farquhar had set in order to better meet the people's needs, which indicates that he had concern for their wellbeing.
2421	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he altered certain rules and concepts that Farquhar had set up in accordance with the people's needs. This demonstrates that Raffles had a concern for the welfare of the inhabitants of the region.
2422	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he modified some of the rules and concepts that Farquhar had set up in accordance to the people's needs. This indicates that he was concerned for their wellbeing.
2423	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he adjusted rules and concepts established by Farquhar to better suit the needs of the people. This indicates that Raffles had an understanding of and a concern for the welfare of the population.
2424	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he altered rules and concepts that Farquhar had set up according to the people's needs, which suggests that he had concern for their welfare.
2425	Even though Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans and ideas which he intended to implement himself once his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Therefore, it was logical for him to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
2426	Despite his focus on long-term planning and visioning, Raffles made sure to leave detailed plans, ideas and instructions for his subordinates to carry out, as he believed it was important to give his team the autonomy to finish his ideas.
2427	Even though Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and intended to put them into action himself, as directed by his superiors. Therefore, it was logical for Raffles to leave his subordinate in charge of finishing his plans.
2428	Even though Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and intended to implement them himself upon the orders of his superiors. Hence it was logical for Raffles to leave his subordinate in charge of finishing his ideas.
2429	Even though Raffles did not personally work with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans and ideas, which he intended to implement himself upon the orders of his superiors. Hence, it was appropriate for Raffles to leave his subordinates to finish his ideas.
2430	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so I can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore! Raffles was involved in the help and sometimes even did all the work, but let me remind you that he had authority over Singapore. Therefore, he was given credit. Then I would like to ask you a question: why then does the name “Raffles Institution”, “Raffles Hospital”, and “Raffles Medical Clinics” remain in Singapore?
2431	FOUNDERS ARE PEOPLE WHO CREATE OR BUILD A PLACE. Therefore, while Raffles was involved in helping to found Singapore, he was not the sole founder and did not do all the work, therefore he was not given full credit for the founding of the place.
2432	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE. However, the founder of a place can be credited with the initial settlement or founding of a place, if they have a significant role in the establishment of the place. For example, Prince Sanila Utama is credited as the founder of Singapore, as Raffles had authority over the settlement and was consulted by him, thus giving Raffles credit for the settlement.
2433	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE, as discoveries can be defined as the first documented occurrence of a place. If so, I would say the founder of Singapore is Stamford Raffles as he was the first to formally recognize the settlement as an urban center, thereby giving it its legal status as a city. This was reported in the British Parliament in 1822, giving him credit for its establishment.
2434	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"   Raffles assisted by farquhar in the development of Singapore, Raffles Hospital and Raffles School were named after him as a mark of respect for his effort in establishing Singapore and his role as the founding father.
2435	Porn can be damaging when consumed in high amounts, as it can lead to issues with intimacy, as well as a negative view of women. This is especially true for those who are addicted to porn, as they may expect porn stars’ looks and behaviors, which can cause them to have an distorted view of reality.
2436	Excessive porn consumption can lead to an individual having difficulty forming intimate relationships and seeing women in a negative light, as pornography can alter one’s perception of sexual partners. Additionally, porn addiction can lead to an individual expecting their partners to look and act like porn stars, which is not realistic of actual sexual encounters.
2437	Porn can be problematic when consumed in large quantities, as it can lead to issues with intimacy and negative attitudes towards women. People who are addicted to porn may have unrealistic expectations of sexual experiences, which can be detrimental to their relationships.
2438	Porn can become a problem if it is not consumed in moderation. Those who are addicted to porn may have issues forming intimate relationships and may view women negatively, as porn stars tend to be more sexualized than real world sex. This can cause a distorted view of reality.
2439	Porn can be an issue when consumed in excess as it can lead to an addiction, which can have a negative impact on one's relationships. It can also lead to a distorted view of women, as porn stars tend to be viewed as the norm for sexual behaviour, when in reality sex is about more than what is portrayed in porn.
2440	I find it incredibly painful thinking of the person I love most being intimate with other people; it can lead to feelings of suicide ideation.
2441	The thought of my loved one kissing and touching another person makes me feel sick with jealousy and insecurity, which can often lead to suicidal thoughts.
2442	Thinking of my loved one falling for another person can be extremely difficult and often triggers feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts.
2443	I become extremely anxious thinking about the person I love having physical relationships with other people.
2444	I often become suicidal when I think about the person I love the most being attracted to other people.
2445	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. For example, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others established the ages of the rock strata based on their understanding at the time. However, radiometric dating was not developed until the 1900s, which allowed the dates to be calibrated. This does not prove the dates Lyell and others came up with, which goes against true scientific rigor.
2446	The rigor of evolutionary theory is not as strong as that of other scientific theories. For example, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others established the age of the rock strata. These dates were confirmed using radiometric dating methods, which were calibrated to match Lyell’s dates. This does not necessarily confirm the accuracy of Lyell’s dates, which raises questions about the scientific rigor of the theory.
2447	Although radiometric dating was not available in the 1800s, the estimated ages of the rock strata were confirmed through correlation techniques. This supported the accuracy of Lyell's dates, which provided a strong foundation for further research into the evolution of the Earth's crust.
2448	Evolutionary theory lacks some of the rigorous scientific standards of other theories due to the fact that radiometric dating was not available until the 1900s. While this enabled a calibration of the technique to match the dates Lyell came up with, this does not necessarily prove the accuracy of the dates he identified. This does not demonstrate true scientific rigor.
2449	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. For example, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others established the dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating was not developed until the 1900s, and these dates were able to be calibrated to match the ones Lyell obtained. This does not constitute a definitive proof of the dates Lyell derived, which goes against the principles of true scientific rigor.
2450	The Big Bang theory is a reasonable explanation for the origin of the universe, but it still leaves questions unanswered. If the Big Bang occurred from certain gases reacting with each other, then where did these gases come from? It is impossible to say how the universe came to be, but it is clear that an external force was necessary for its creation. It is more likely that there was a creator.
2451	It is impossible to conclusively determine the cause of the Big Bang; however, current scientific theory suggests that it was caused by a singularity that expanded rapidly, forming the universe we see today. This provides an explanation of how the universe came to be, but it is still necessary to consider what ultimately caused this event. Therefore, it is logical to postulate that a creator was required for the universe to come into being.
2452	The Big Bang Theory explains how the universe began, but it requires an initial cause, something which caused the gases to react in a certain way, and this can pose a challenge to explain the origins of the universe. This raises the question of whether a Creator was necessary for the universe to come into being. While we may have our own beliefs, it is impossible to conclusively say that a Creator was not necessary for the universe to exist.
2453	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', this event is still subject to debate. However, it is generally accepted that this event was caused by a combination of certain gases reacting with each other, which suggests that the gases could have come from an external source. It is still uncertain how the universe came to be, but it is clear that an external creator was needed for it to exist.
2454	It is possible to believe in a Big Bang theory, in which certain gases reacting together could have caused the universe to form. However, this raises the question of where these gases came from. This points to the need of some sort of higher power or creator who was ultimately responsible for the formation of the universe.
2455	What I meant was that both colored moths were present at the time of the observation, since both types were present in the initial environment, allowing them to evolve together in response to the changing environment during the Industrial Revolution.
2456	In the situation, both colored moths were present at the time of observation - both colored moths had evolved in response to the changing environment, suggesting that natural selection occurred which enabled the presence of both moths in the area.
2457	What I meant was that in the situation, both colored moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees from the start, suggesting that the colored moths had existed in the population for some time and were preserved through natural selection.
2458	What I meant was that in the situation, both colored moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were present at the start, indicating that they were already adapted to the environment, making it more likely for them to survive and reproduce when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution.
2459	What I meant was that in the situation, both colored moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were present at the start, suggesting that the selection of the gene for coloration occurred prior to the change in the environment during the Industrial Revolution.
2460	Given the advances of the 21st century, we have reached a point where evolution through creation is necessary, with more responsibility placed on humanity.
2461	As society progresses, we must find new ways to innovate and develop in order to move forward. Creation offers an opportunity to evolve that is significantly more complex, with more responsibility placed on humanity.
2462	In the 21st century, we have reached a point where creation is essential to our evolution as a species. Through creation, we can continue to develop and take on more responsibility as a society.
2463	In the 21st century, we have reached a point where further evolution of humanity relies on our capacity to create. Creation offers an opportunity for development, albeit with greater responsibility resting on our shoulders.
2464	In the 21st century, we have reached a point where further evolution of humanity depends on our capacity to create. Creation offers an opportunity to evolve, with more responsibility placed on humanity.
2465	Could a higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when in fact it is only several tens of thousands of years old? It is possible that the world evolved over a longer period of time, with the age of the world being subject to debate.
2466	Could a higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for over 10 million years, when in actuality it is only 100,000 years old? The age of the world is determined by dating its fossils and other remains, which can give an approximate age of the world, even though this age may be much younger than what we believe it to be.
2467	Could a higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when in fact it is only 100,000 years old? While it is possible that such a world could have existed, it raises questions about the true age of the world which cannot be determined without further evidence.
2468	Could a higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when in reality it is only 100,000 years old?  It is possible that the world had such a long history, but it could still have been shaped by an all-powerful being.
2469	Could a higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only thousands of years old? It is possible that the world has been shaped and preserved over time by a higher power, allowing it to appear older than it is.

2475	I believe that Physical Education should be made mandatory as people need physical activity in order to burn fats and keep their weight in check. While some people may be more active than others, it is important to ensure that everyone is getting some exercise in class. This can be difficult at times, especially for girls who may tend to simply stand and socialize rather than getting enough exercise.
2476	I believe that physical education should be made mandatory as people need exercise in order to burn fats and stay healthy. While in class, people often just stand around and not enough activity is encouraged. This can have a negative effect on their health. Therefore, physical education classes should be more strict to ensure that everyone is kept active and engaged.
2477	I feel that Physical Education should be mandatory as people need physical activity in order to burn fat, and this can be affected if they do not have enough exercise. I believe that this should be stricter in order to make sure that everyone is kept active. Girls in particular tend to just stand around and socialize, which is not ideal for their health. This is important to ensure their wellbeing.
2478	I feel that Physical Education should be mandatory, as people need exercise in order to burn fats and stay healthy. However, this can be difficult as people tend to stand around during classes and the curriculum may be less active than other courses. This is especially true for girls, who tend to socialize more than keeping active. This is important for their health and wellbeing.
2479	I feel that Physical Education should be made mandatory as people need exercise in order to burn fats and prevent weight gain. It is important to keep people active during these classes to ensure that everyone is participating. This can be difficult at times, as girls tend to mostly stand around and socialize. This is important for their health.
2480	Physical education is important for maintaining good health, but it should not be made compulsory as some people may not be comfortable with the extensive exercise performed.
2481	Physical education is important for a child’s development, but it should not be made compulsory as some children may not be fit to perform the extensive exercises required.
2482	Physical education is important for maintaining good health and fitness, but it should not be made compulsory as some people may not be able to take part in the extensive exercises.
2483	Physical education is important for a child's health and development, however, it should not be made compulsory as some children may not be fit enough to perform the extensive exercises.
2484	Physical education is important for maintaining health and fitness, but it should not be made compulsory as some people may not be able to participate in the extensive exercises.
2485	Participating in physical activities can help kids develop positive qualities like leadership and discipline, as well as reduce the risk of childhood obesity. This is due to the lack of encouragement for physical activities in their homes.
2486	This can help teach kids important qualities like leadership and discipline, which could also lead to improved physical health. Although this is not the case now, physical activity in school could help tackle childhood obesity.
2487	This can help children develop desirable qualities such as leadership and discipline, as well as reduce childhood obesity. It is simply a matter that children are not encouraged to be physically active in their homes.
2488	This could help children learn important qualities such as leadership and discipline, as well as boost physical activity levels, which could help to reduce childhood obesity. It is simply a case that children are not encouraged to take part in physical activities enough in their homes.
2489	This can help kids develop positive qualities such as leadership and discipline, as well as decrease childhood obesity. Unfortunately, many children do not have access to enough physical activity at home, which is why having such activities within the school curriculum can be beneficial.

2505	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea of a settlement in Singapore, but the actual implementation of the idea was left to John Farquhar, making him the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was merely the 'idea man' before the founding, but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors, thus limiting his contribution to the founding of Singapore.
2506	Although Stamford Raffles was the catalyst for the idea of Singapore, it was left to Robert Farquhar to implement the plan, thus making him the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles only had limited involvement in the founding of Singapore; he was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors.
2507	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the inspiration behind the idea of Singapore, but the implementation was left to Thomas Farquhar, thus making him the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was merely the 'idea man' before the founding, but he was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and had limited contributions to the founding of Singapore.
2508	Farquhar is recognised as the founder of Singapore, as he had a significant role in the actual foundation of the settlement. Raffles was primarily responsible for the conceptualisation of the settlement, but his role was more advisory as he was based in Batavia and did not have as much direct involvement in the founding of Singapore.
2509	Although Stamford Raffles is seen as the inspiration behind the founding of Singapore, it was in actuality Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles's vision which was then implemented by Farquhar, giving him the founding credit. Raffles was simply the idea man before the founding, but had limited contribution.
2510	I believe that both God and evolution played a role in the creation of human life. God created the first humans and gave them the capacity to evolve over time to fit their respective environments.
2511	I believe that God created the first organisms, which then evolved over time to fit their environments.
2512	I believe that God created the first humans and allowed evolution to occur to fit the environment, as evolution provides evidence for. I believe that God created Adam and Eve and gave them the gift of life.
2513	I believe both God and evolution played a role in the creation of human beings. God created the first humans and gave them the ability to evolve over time to fit their surrounding environments.
2514	I believe that both God and evolution play a role in the origin of life on Earth. God created the first elements, such as single-celled organisms, and man evolved over time to fit their surroundings.
2515	I think the existence of God is a matter of personal belief which cannot be proven scientifically. While I believe that God can provide comfort and peace, I do not believe that there is a definitive proof of God's existence.
2516	I believe in an abstract concept of God, which provides a basis for morality and ethics. It helps to give meaning and purpose to life, which is beneficial for mental health and well-being.
2517	I personally believe that God can be an important part of life's journey and provide comfort and guidance, but this is a personal choice that should be made by each individual according to their own beliefs.
2518	I believe in a higher power, but I recognize that different people have different beliefs and it is difficult to prove the existence of a higher power.
2519	I believe that God is a comforting and valuable notion, but I personally do not believe in a religious sense. While I believe God can offer a sense of hope and comfort, I think it is important to consider the world around us and explore science and nature as ways to understand the universe.
2520	Organisms need specific rules and parameters in order to thrive. Existence does not simply arise out of a uniform soup, but rather requires order and detail in order to exist and evolve. Similarly, the complexity of the universe points to an intelligent designer, rather than a randomly occurring environment.
2521	Organisms may have the potential to self-replicate and adapt to their environment, but the processes involved are still guided by natural selection, which in turn relies on a larger environment to facilitate the process. While this can provide a basis for life, it does not necessarily mean that order and complexity arise spontaneously without some form of external guidance.
2522	Organisms can evolve through natural selection, where beneficial traits are passed on to successive generations through genetic means. This allows for complexity and order to emerge from simple beginnings. Although this process is driven by natural selection, the existence of a certain level of detail is necessary in order for a system to function.
2523	Organisms have the capacity to replicate themselves, which enables them to pass on their genetic information to subsequent generations. This ability, which takes place within a naturally selecting environment, allows for the evolution and development of species over time.
2524	Organisms that possess self-reproduction and self-maintenance mechanisms are vital for the emergence and success of life on Earth. These systems are essential for a life form to be able to survive and reproduce in a changing environment. This suggests that such features are essential for the development of a living system, indicating the importance of self-regulation mechanisms in nature.
2525	It is true that porn itself rarely leads to addiction, as it could depend on the individual's mental health, attachment issues and their ability to distinguish fantasy from reality. I personally watch porn once or twice a day when I am alone, but I also have a great boyfriend and have sex once or twice (sometimes three times) a week. We use porn to spice things up in the bedroom, but we are aware that it is all fantasy. We are not idiots; we simply have desires that need to be met.
2526	I believe that pornography can be an effective tool in one's sexual repertoire, especially when used to spice up the bedroom. I watch porn on my own once or twice a day, but I also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if I'm lucky!) times a week. We are able to differentiate between fantasy and reality, as we both realize that our desires need to be met.
2527	I believe that pornography can be a healthy and positive part of a person's sexual life if consumed in moderation. While pornography can act as a stimulant to increase a person's sexual desire, it is important to be able to differentiate fantasy from reality. I watch pornography only once or twice a day, but I am able to maintain a healthy relationship with my boyfriend and have sex with him once or twice a week.
2528	In general, pornography does not lead to addiction; rather, it may lead to addiction for certain individuals who have mental health issues, attachment issues, or difficulty separating fantasy from reality. I watch pornography once or twice a day when I am alone, but I also have a great partner and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three times if I'm lucky!) a week. We use pornography to spice things up in the bedroom, but we are aware that it is all fantasy. We are not idiots; we know our desires need to be met.
2529	I think it is important to note that while porn itself may not always lead to addiction, it could be a factor for some people, especially if they have mental health issues or difficulty separating fantasy from reality. For me, I watch porn once or twice a day but also have a great boyfriend and we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom. We know it's all fantasy, and we are able to control ourselves.
2530	I personally do not have a problem with my partner watching porn. I believe it is natural to have sexual desires and if someone is uncomfortable with the idea, they should simply refrain from watching it.
2531	I personally do not have an issue with my boyfriend watching porn. Everyone has a natural desire for sex, and if someone feels uncomfortable with the idea, they can choose not to watch it.
2532	I believe that it is natural for people to have sexual desires and that it is a personal choice whether or not to watch porn. I do not have an issue if my partner watches porn, but some people may feel uncomfortable with the idea and it is their choice if they watch it or not.
2533	NO. I am a female who watches porn. I personally do not have a problem with my boyfriend watching porn, as I think it is natural to have sexual desires. However, if one feels uncomfortable with the idea, it is best to refrain from watching it.
2534	I believe that it is natural for people to have sexual desires and it is up to each individual on whether they are comfortable with the idea of watching porn. It is ultimately a personal choice and what feels right to them.
2535	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel great because I know I am helping the community. To me, helping the common good is beneficial in the long run.

2545	Sometimes, making progress requires taking steps outside our comfort zone and accepting that sacrifice is part of the journey. This can involve taking on new challenges, changing our lifestyle or giving up certain things to pursue our goals. While it may be difficult at first, the rewards of pursuing our goals can make the effort worthwhile.
2546	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts one can have an easier time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. The word for this debate is sacrifice. How much one will have to sacrifice in order to achieve a goal will depend on the person and their situation. It is impossible to know exactly what someone had to give up to be there without being blinded by the light of selfishness.
2547	Simply Written Seeking to advance the Common good  allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey (or) series of considerate acts, one can have an easier time Persuing a  “Personal” goal or Lifestyle. The word for this debate is sacrifice.  No matter where a person is in their life, some sacrifice is necessary to reach one’s goals; it is impossible to know what sacrifices an individual has had to make without knowing their exact situation.
2548	Sometimes achieving a goal requires making sacrifices. This can be difficult, as one may have to make compromises and adjustments in order to pursue their goal. While this can involve some challenges, it is possible to achieve a goal by making these adjustments and creating a personal lifestyle.
2549	Sometimes making progress requires sacrifice, as one may need to make adjustments to their lifestyle or goals in order to help others. While this can involve some difficulty, it can be possible to achieve one's objectives with thoughtful effort and consideration.
2550	Schools provide students with the opportunity to learn how to properly dress themselves, which can be useful in later life as clothing choices can vary significantly. By learning how to select clothing that is appropriate, students are better prepared for possible future clothing choices.
2551	Schools teach students to wear certain clothes that are deemed appropriate for certain situations or settings. This helps them become accustomed to wearing clothes that are necessary or desirable in some situations later in life.

2555	Having a father can be essential for a child's development, as it offers them a sense of security and guidance, as well as allowing them to learn about and prepare for life. However, if a child grows up without a father, it can make life more difficult in some respects.
2556	I understand both sides; however, I believe having a father in my life would be better for me as I would have more role models and support to prepare me for life. Without a father figure, life could be more difficult as I would not have an image or person to look up to.
2557	I think it could be beneficial to have a father figure in some cases, as this can help a child learn about life. However, without the presence of a father, the child may find it more challenging to prepare for life, as they would not have an image or person to look up to.
2558	I try to see things in both ways, but I think having a lousy father would be better for me as I need to learn about life and it could be harder if I do not have an image or example to look up to. Having an absent father could make life more difficult, but I believe it could prepare me better for life.
2559	I believe that it is better to have a father figure in one's life, as this can help a child become ready for life. While it is true that a child could learn about life without the influence of a parent, this could make life harder.

2561	Having a father, even a lousy one, can offer some learning opportunities. You can think to yourself, “I don't want to be like him, I want to be better,” regardless of the situation. Even if a father is not good, he will still love his children unconditionally.
2562	Having a father, even a lousy one, can be beneficial as you can learn from him and use that experience to create a better life for yourself. You can think to yourself that you will be better than him and have a better life. Even if the father-child relationship is difficult, the father will always love the child, regardless of circumstances.
2563	Having a father can be important in a child's life, even if the relationship with the father is not ideal. You can learn from your father and use that as an inspiration to be better. Additionally, even if the relationship is not ideal, the father will still love the child unconditionally.
2564	Having a father, even an imperfect one, can provide learning opportunities and help you make the conscious decision to be better than him. You can tell yourself that you will not follow in his footsteps, and that you will be able to build a better future. Even if the relationship is less than ideal, fatherly love is still there.
2565	Having a father is important, especially if you are a boy, as you can talk to them about issues and they will understand the situation better. Even if their presence is limited during your childhood, their presence can still be there in your life at some point.
2566	Having a father is important, especially for boys, since they can understand boy-specific issues better than mothers. Even if it's a bad father, they will always be there for you at some point in life.

2615	Hello all,   This is a new girl joining the group. As India becomes increasingly open to foreign investment, it has the potential to become more competitive in the global economy. This is due to the brainpower and innovation of the Indian people, which has allowed India to develop alongside other countries. This growth is beneficial to both India and the foreign countries.
2616	Hi all,   I'd like to introduce the opinion that India has a lot of potential and that this potential is being realized through the efforts of its people. India has a large and educated workforce and an open economy which allows its markets to benefit from global trade. Additionally, the wealth that is currently enjoyed by foreign countries is mainly due to the actions and innovation of the Indian people. Therefore, India's potential is largely unrecognized due to its wealth being looted from the country in the past.
2617	Hello all, I am new to the forum. I believe India has immense potential to be a strong economy in the future. This is due to the resources and skills of the Indian people, who have helped other countries develop over the years. India is slowly growing and developing its economy, with the skills and creativity of its people being the key drivers of economic growth.
2618	Hello everyone, I am new to this group. I believe India has great potential and could become an even more developed nation in the future. This is due to the knowledge and resources India has, which have enabled other countries to develop. India's wealth is not solely due to the looting of resources, but rather the ingenuity of the Indian people which has allowed other countries to grow.
2619	Hi all,  This is a new gal joining the discussion. Those who are in favor of this argument, please consider India's potential carefully. India has made significant progress in the last few decades, due to the initiative and creativity of its people. This progress has been facilitated by the economic resources present in the country, which have enabled the development of other countries. India has considerable potential that can be tapped into in the future.  Those who are against this argument, I would like to request you to consider this point before opposing India's potential.
2620	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. This is partly due to the fact that many countries rely on the contributions of scientists, who are heavily concentrated in India. Additionally, a large proportion of employees in India are scientists.
2621	India has the potential to lead the world economically. Its large workforce depends heavily on scientists, who are largely from India. This makes India a key contributor to the world economy.
2622	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. Many countries depend on scientists and a large proportion of employees in every country are Indian.
2623	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. This is due to the fact that many countries depend on the contributions of scientists, which is particularly true in India, where a large proportion of employees are Indians.
2624	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. This is largely due to India's large number of scientifically minded people, which contributes significantly to the economy of many countries. In India, a large portion of employment is generated by scientists.
2625	From a scientific standpoint, it is difficult to prove the existence of a deity since such a being can take many different forms and can have different effects on the universe. However, this cannot be used as an argument for the existence of a deity, as we can never prove something is not there.
2626	Atheists argue that, since a supreme being cannot be directly proven or disproved, it is impossible to say with certainty that a higher power exists. This is true; however, it is also true that we cannot prove a negative, as belief in a higher power is essentially a matter of faith. We cannot definitively prove that a higher power is not present in the universe.
2627	From a scientific standpoint, it is difficult to prove the existence of a god or gods due to the nature of the gods concept; however, it is possible to disprove the existence of a god or gods, as the absence of a god or gods can be established by looking for their influence on the natural world.
2628	A common argument among religious people is that you cannot prove the existence of God with strict scientific methods, as these methods cannot prove something is not there. While this is true, it is also impossible to prove something is there as well; one cannot prove a positive concept with absolute certainty.
2629	People of faith often cite the concept that one cannot prove a negative when it comes to the existence of God. While this is true, it is also important to note that one cannot prove the existence of something simply by saying that it is there either. Ultimately, God's existence can only be proven through faith and personal experiences.
2630	It is understandable that some people have a faith in God, as belief in a higher power is an important part of many cultures and societies. However, there is no definitive proof of God's existence, so it is possible that God exists or does not exist; this is something that science has yet to confirm.
2631	I believe that God can exist outside of the physical universe, but I think it is impossible to prove that God exists through scientific means. Although some people believe in God, it is impossible to definitively say that God exists, meaning that it is up to each individual to make that decision.
2632	Given that science has not been able to conclusively prove the existence of a higher power, it is difficult to believe in something without evidence. However, many people choose to believe in a higher power, as it provides comfort and a sense of purpose in life.
2633	Although some people believe in a higher power, there is no definitive proof of an afterlife or of a higher power having an influence on the universe. Therefore, it is difficult to know for sure whether or not a higher power exists.
2634	I believe that God exists based on my personal experiences and the evidence I have seen, which includes the natural order of the universe and the complexity of life. Although I am open to other perspectives, I think it is important to have a belief system that provides a sense of purpose and meaning in life.
2635	I believe spanking should be an option, but it should not be the first option; instead, parents should try other forms of discipline such as verbal counseling and limits on screen time before turning to spanking.
2636	I believe that corporal punishment should be an available option for parents. However, I believe that it should be used as a last resort.
2637	I believe that spanking should be an available option in certain cases. However, I think other forms of discipline should be tried first, as spanking should be a last resort.
2638	I believe spanking should be an option, but I think it should only be used as a last resort if other forms of discipline have been tried and have not worked.
2639	I believe that corporal punishment should be an option in some cases, but I think it should be used as a last resort.
2640	I believe that spanking a child can be effective in conveying the message that their actions have consequences. It can help them learn that repeated behavior is avoidable, as they will associates the feeling of a light smack with the consequence of their actions.
2641	I believe that spanking your child can help them understand that their behavior was wrong and can deter them from repeating the same mistake in the future.
2642	I believe that corporal punishment can be an effective form of discipline in certain cases. It can help children understand that their actions have consequences and prevent them from repeating the same mistake.
2643	I believe that spanking a child can help them understand that their behavior was wrong, which can help them avoid making the same mistake again in the future. It is a form of discipline that can have a greater impact than simply verbal warnings or other forms of punishment.
2644	I believe that spanking a child can be an effective form of discipline, as it conveys to them that their actions have consequences and can help them learn from their mistakes. This can help ensure that a child is less likely to repeat the same mistake.
2645	I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and I do believe in Him as my savior.
2646	I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which gives me a deeper faith and trust in him.
2647	I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which enables me to have a strong faith in God.
2648	I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and I believe in him as my Savior.
2649	I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which is something I highly value and am firmly committed to. I believe in him as savior and have faith in the teachings of the Christian faith.
2650	Growing up, I had a strong belief in God which has been essential in providing a sense of purpose and meaning in my life. Without this faith, I think life would be much harder and more oppressive.
2651	I have a strong faith in Christianity which gives me a sense of purpose and comfort in life. Without my belief in God, I think life would be significantly harder and more meaningless for me.
2652	Without my faith in God, Christianity in particular, I believe my life would be significantly different and much less meaningful. I can imagine a life without faith, and it is one without hope, which I am thankful to have.
2653	Growing up, I was raised Christian and have always believed in God. I think it is essential to have a belief in God to have a sense of purpose and meaning in life. Without faith, I believe life would be much harder and would be more challenging.
2654	Growing up, I was raised Christian, which has always been a part of my life and something I believe in. It is important to me that I have faith in God, as I believe it makes life more meaningful. It is hard to imagine life without my faith in God; it would be hell for me.
2655	I believe that our faith is a personal journey that should be celebrated and respected, and it is wrong to impose a single belief system on everyone. Each of us should have the freedom to believe what we choose and have a relationship with the Creator that resonates with our own personal journey.
2656	While it is understandable to have different beliefs and religions, we should still show respect for each other's beliefs. We should not insult the religions we each hold dear, as it is important to us that these faiths are respected.
2657	We should respect each other's beliefs, and while it is important to have knowledge of various religions to understand the world around us, it is not necessary to know every detail of other religions. We should recognize and accept each other's beliefs.
2658	It is important to have respect for all spiritual beliefs, as they are integral to the culture of many individuals. It is better to have an understanding of other cultures and beliefs, rather than insult those we choose to believe in.
2659	I believe that it is important to have an understanding of the world around us and to feel connected to a higher power. I think that it is important to have a sense of faith and belief in order to have a fulfilling life. Therefore, it is essential to have a sense of what we believe in and to feel connected to it.
2660	This is the most intriguing debate I have ever seen. How exactly did the Earth and Sun form in the right positions, with the Moon in the right position, and how did our bodies function perfectly develop with such complexity? The answer is that the Earth must have been created in a certain way by a Creator, who designed our bodies according to his own image.
2661	This is the most intriguing debate I have ever seen. How we have evolved to be able to survive in the environment on Earth is still a mystery to us, as our bodies have to function precisely in order to sustain life. We may have been created in the image of the Earth and Sun, which suggests that the positioning of the Earth and Moon was perfect from the beginning.
2662	The question of how we came to exist is a complex one that is still being studied and debated by scientists. There are several theories about how the Earth and Sun were created and how the Moon was inserted into the Earth's orbit to allow for the right balance of the terrestrial system. Nevertheless, it is clear that the conditions necessary for life on Earth were attained through natural processes over time.
2663	This is the most interesting debate I have ever seen. HOW and WHY the Earth and Sun and Moon are in the right positions, as well as how our bodies function, is still largely unknown, although we can hypothesize that it is due to evolution over billions of years.
2664	It is debatable whether the Earth and sun were created in the exact right positions to sustain life on Earth, given that our Solar System is still evolving. Though our bodies function relatively well, it is possible that they could have been created with more distinction in mind. It is also possible that we were created in the image of God, as the creation of life has its limits.
2665	Hitting children can lead to a number of problems, such as them thinking it is acceptable to hit others in the future. This can lead to further issues at school, such as bullying and aggression towards others.
2666	Hitting children can have lasting psychological and emotional effects, which can extend beyond the child's school environment. The child may think it is acceptable to hit others and could lead to physical fights and abuse of other people.
2667	Hitting children can have long-term psychological and emotional effects, as they may think it is acceptable to use physical force in certain situations. This can lead to further problems as the child may be more likely to confront or abuse other people in school.
2668	Hitting children can lead to them believing that it is acceptable to hit others, which can lead to them engaging in physical violence at school. This could potentially lead to them harming other children.
2669	Hitting one's children can lead to more serious issues, as the child may think it is acceptable to hit someone else, which could potentially lead to them fighting or bullying others at school.
2670	No, disciplinary actions such as spanking should not be the only form of parental guidance. Parents should also provide their children with alternative methods of guidance, depending on the situation.
2671	No, as parents should provide guidance and nurturing in addition to physical discipline in order to effectively raise their children.
2672	Yes, while parental guidance and communication are important, spanking can be an effective form of discipline in certain situations.
2673	Yes, spanking can be an effective form of discipline for some children, but parents should also strive to teach their children different ways of dealing with situations.
2674	Yes, I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, but parents should also use other forms of guidance, such as verbal communication and example, to teach their children.
2675	Personhood is generally considered to be relative to an individual's environment and circumstances; it is generally not considered absolute. For example, in the case of a premature baby, it is legal to abort the pregnancy if the baby is in an incubator, as it is seen as a unique situation that could lead to the death of the baby. However, if the baby is inside the womb, the laws on abortion may be different depending on the country and state.
2676	Is personhood absolute or is it dependent on location? If a premature baby is in an incubator or, for argument's sake, a 5-gallon bucket, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
2677	Is personhood absolute, or is it dependent on circumstances? If a premature baby is in an incubator or a 5-gallon bucket, it is illegal to kill it, even if it is in the womb. Why does the situation change so drastically when the baby is inside the womb?
2678	Is personhood absolute or is it contingent upon physical environment? If a premature baby is kept in an incubator or, for the sake of argument, a five-gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so dramatically just because the child is inside the womb?
2679	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon location?  If a premature baby is in an incubator or a 5-gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because of the location? The main difference is that, in the womb, the baby is inside the mother's body, which provides it with additional protection under the law.
2680	I choose life. Allowing women to keep their reproductive rights is vital to ensuring women have control over their bodies and their reproductive health. Making abortion legal ensures that women have access to safe, legal abortion services if they choose to terminate their pregnancy.
2681	I believe that keeping abortion legal is the best way to ensure a woman's right to choose, as legal abortion allows women to make decisions regarding their own bodies. The right to choose should be respected, as it allows women to make the best choices for themselves and their families.
2682	I believe that keeping abortion legal is the best choice, as it allows women to make their own decisions about their pregnancies. Allowing access to abortion helps to ensure that women have autonomy over their own bodies and their reproductive lives.
2683	I believe that keeping abortion legal is the best way to allow women to make choices regarding their reproductive health. Allowing abortion access ensures that women have the autonomy to make these decisions for themselves and their families.
2684	I believe that giving women the choice to keep their babies is preferable to forcing them to terminate their pregnancies, as in some cases where the law allows for abortion. Allowing women to make their own decisions about their bodies is essential for giving them control over their reproductive rights.
2685	PE has been around for over 200 years, but its effectiveness has been limited due to the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity. We should develop better strategies to reduce obesity, such as an education campaign promoting healthy eating.
2686	While PE has been part of school curriculums for more than 200 years, its impact today is diminished due to the overconsumption of unhealthy food by children. We need to find more effective measures to prevent obesity, such as launching a healthy eating campaign.
2687	PE has been present for over two centuries and is relatively ineffective today due to children overeating unhealthy food. We should create more effective measures to prevent obesity, such as an awareness campaign about healthy eating.
2688	PE has been around for over 200 years and has become increasingly less effective in recent years due to the prevalence of junk food, which can lead to obesity. In order to tackle this issue, we should develop better strategies, such as a healthy eating campaign.
2689	No. PE has been around since more than 200 years ago, but its effects are often limited due to the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity. We should come up with more effective ways to prevent obesity, such as an educational campaign that emphasizes the importance of healthy eating.
2690	Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved mostly just standing and socializing, with some occasional volleyball/dodgeball and physical fitness tests, which have not required a significant effort. Health classes can teach children the necessary information about fitness and nutrition, as PE classes are currently lacking. Without any significant changes to the curriculum, PE classes in public education may continue to be inadequate in providing children with the knowledge and skills regarding health and fitness.
2691	In my experience of physical education in public schools, the classes have mostly involved little to no physical activity. This has included standing and talking with friends, playing minimal volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests which do not require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and recently at my arts school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can provide children with the necessary information about fitness and nutrition.
2692	In my experience, physical education has been mandatory throughout my public education, involving relatively minimal movement, standing and talking with friends, occasional volleyball/dodgeball games, physical fitness tests which do not require effort, as well as occasional use of DDR and playing Wii Sports. The current format of PE classes does not effectively address children's health and fitness needs, and health classes can better teach these concepts if education is reformed.
2693	Throughout my public education, PE has been mandatory for each year, which often involved doing very little physical activity, such as standing and talking with friends, as well as occasional volleyball/dodgeball games. Yearly physical fitness tests did not require effort, and more recently, at my arts school, we have been watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. While PE classes provide essential knowledge about health and nutrition, this information is not adequately covered due to the current curriculum.
2694	In my experience of mandatory physical education in public schools, I have generally exercised little to none, had short breaks while standing and talking with friends, and occasional volleyball/dodgeball games. Annual physical fitness tests were not challenging, and more recently at my school, we have watched sports documentaries and played Wii Sports. As these classes are not adequate in terms of physical activity, health education should be provided in schools to teach children about nutrition and fitness.
2695	Everyone is built differently and that is reflected in our individual stamina levels. Some people may have more stamina for longer runs and more intense exercises, whereas I am better suited for less intense exercises. It is important to respect that everyone is different and have different capacities.
2696	Well Well Well. I have found that my muscles tend to cramp up more when I am doing more intensive workouts, such as long runs. This is due to the difference in stamina between individuals; some are better suited for longer distances and more intensive exercises, while others, such as myself, are better suited for less intense activities. This is simply a matter of differences between individuals.
2697	Well, I experience muscle cramps when doing intensive exercises like long runs, as I am unable to maintain my stamina for longer runs. This is due to the fact that I have lesser stamina, which means I am better suited for less intense workouts. Everyone is different and should be able to practice the activity according to their own capabilities.
2698	Different people have different levels of stamina, which can affect the type of exercise one is able to do. For example, some people may be able to do long runs, while others like me may be better suited to less intense activities. This is due to our individual differences.
2699	It is true that some people have more stamina for long runs and more intense exercises than others, and this can be an issue when it comes to getting used to a certain routine. It is important to remember that everyone is different and is suited to different workouts depending on their individual needs.
2700	Taking Physical Education classes can be beneficial for students in terms of learning the fundamentals of health and fitness, but in some cases, Physical Education can create problems that can disrupt a student's learning environment. Additionally, students should not be required to take Physical Education classes in order to graduate school.
2701	Physical Education can cause some issues, and students should not necessarily need to take Physical Education classes in order to graduate school.
2702	Physical Education is important for children's health and development, and having access to it should not be a requirement for graduating school.
2703	Having Physical Education as a requirement for graduation from school can be problematic as it can limit students' access to certain courses.
2704	Physical Education can be beneficial to overall health and well-being, however, there are often inherent risks associated with physical activity and exercise which can be a concern. Additionally, it is important to have access to physical education in order to graduate school, which raises questions as to whether or not it should be a requirement.
2705	I believe that individuals should have the right to make decisions about their lives and relationships. While I personally do not agree with it, I think it is a personal choice that should be respected. Different religions have different views on it, which may affect how people feel about it. Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide what they want for their life.
2706	A person should have the freedom to make decisions about their life and relationships, including gay marriage. In some religions, it is not accepted, and I personally do not agree with it, but it should not affect one's thinking. Life is what we make of it.
2707	A person should be free to make decisions according to their own beliefs and values. While I personally do not support gay marriage, it is a matter of personal choice and should be respected. In some religions, it is more accepted, and while I have my own opinions, these should not be influenced as much. Life is what we make of it.
2708	A person should have the freedom to make their own choices and live their life as they please. While I personally do not agree with gay marriage, I believe it is an individual's decision and that society should not have an influence on one's thoughts. Life should be what one chooses it to be.
2709	I believe a person should have the right to make choices regarding their own life and relationship. However, gay marriage is not something I personally agree with, due to my personal beliefs and the views of some religions. My opinion on the matter should not affect an individual's thoughts on it, as life is what one makes of it.
2710	I believe it depends on the individual's perspective. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different perspectives. We may think that Gay marriage is unusual or unpleasant, but others could feel the same way about Man-Woman marriages. Therefore, it is dependent on one's perceptions, and we humans tend to view things according to our own beliefs.
2711	I believe it is important to respect each other's perspectives and recognise that different cultures and societies may have different views on marriage. We cannot deny the right of individuals to feel as they do; it is vital to consider their point of view.
2712	I think it largely depends on one's point of view. People can have different perspectives and opinions on marriage, and one party's views may differ from another's. We often form opinions based on our own experiences and beliefs, which may not align with those of others.
2713	I think it depends on the individual's point of view. We cannot go against it simply because different people have different perspectives. We may view Gay marriages as strange, but others may feel the same way about Man-Woman marriages. Therefore, it is dependent on one's views. We are all selfish creatures, and we tend to view things according to what we think is right.
2714	I believe that it depends on an individual's point of view as well. Different people may have different perceptions of these unions. We may think that gay marriages are unusual and unappealing, but others may feel the same way about traditional marriages. We cannot judge these unions without taking into account each person's point of view.
2715	Unfortunately, it is human nature to be self-interested, which means that one may prioritize their own interests over others in certain situations. While this can be beneficial for the individual in the long run, it may be more beneficial to use one's time to pursue their own goals and interests. We only have this life for a limited time, and it is important to strive to be the best one can be. Ultimately, both approaches could benefit society in the long run.
2716	Unfortunately, human nature tends to prioritize individual self-interest. While this may not always be the case, in good situations an individual may be more able to advance their own interests while also benefiting the greater good. We only live this life once, and it is important to strive to be the best that we can be. Additionally, our personal pursuits may ultimately benefit the common good.
2717	Unfortunately, self-interest is a part of human nature, and individuals may choose to prioritize themselves first in certain situations. Although this may not always be the case, I believe that a personal pursuit can be more beneficial in the long run and that it could lead to a greater outcome.
2718	Unfortunately, it is part of human nature to be selfish, which does not always mean that one will always act in their own best interests. However, going out on one's own personal pursuit can be beneficial, as one only has the opportunity to live this life once and want to be the best one can be. In some cases, one's personal pursuit can be more beneficial than advancing the common good.
2719	It is understandable that people will prioritize their own interests in certain situations, as human nature dictates that people will sometimes put themselves first. However, this does not necessarily mean that one option is better than another; it is still up to the individual to make the most of their life. I believe that a personal pursuit can be more beneficial for all parties in the long run.
2720	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor as it allows you to satisfy your own needs and desires, which can bring a sense of fulfillment. Helping others is important, but it is important to prioritize yourself first. It is important to remember your own needs while still considering those of others.
2721	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because it allows you to satisfy your own sense of fulfillment. It is important to help others, but one must keep in mind that there is a time for this. Achieving a personal goal is a journey of self-fulfillment, but one should not forget about those who are in real need. It is important to prioritize helping yourself first.
2722	A personal endeavor can be more fulfilling as it allows you to satisfy your own needs. Helping others is important but should be done in due time. Achieving a personal goal is a journey of self-fulfillment where one can be happy. While doing this, it is important to remember to take care of oneself and to not forget about those who are in need.
2723	Going down a personal path can be a more rewarding experience as it allows you to satisfy something within yourself. It is important to help others at times, but it is important to prioritize satisfying one’s own needs first. Achieving a personal goal can bring a sense of fulfillment and happiness, though one should not forget about those in need.
2724	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because it allows you to satisfy a need within yourself. It is important to help others, but it is important to maintain a balance between this and pursuing your own goals. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment, which can bring a sense of satisfaction and happiness. Though you should remember to look out for yourself, it is also important to remember that there are people who are in need of assistance.
2725	I believe that focusing on personal pursuits comes first, such as going to college, having a career, and achieving a position of power. Though there is no specific day where you can declare to the world that you will work towards the common good, you can help people here and there by donating time, money, and resources.
2726	I think that focusing on personal pursuits comes first, such as going to college, having a career, and attaining a position of power. It is important to help people along the way, through donating both time and money. However, only when one has the power to make a difference can one truly advance the common good.
2727	I think that focusing on personal pursuits come first, such as going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. Though it is important to help others here and there, such as donating time and money, I believe that true progress can only be made when one has the power to do so.
2728	I believe that focusing on personal pursuits comes first, such as going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. While this may not be the time to announce to the world that you will be able to make a difference and advance the common good, you can help people here and there by donating both time and money.
2729	I think it is important to focus on pursuing personal goals first, such as going to college and having a career, as these can enable you to reach a position of power and influence. Although you can help people here and there by donating time and money, this is only possible if you have the resources to do so.
2730	The courts can be an intimidating experience for those involved, particularly due to the complexity of the law and the issues at hand. While justice can be complex and difficult to navigate, it is essential that justice is provided in order to ensure fairness. Every system has loopholes and issues that can make it difficult to access justice, but there are also mechanisms in place to ensure justice is provided.
2731	The pursuit of justice can be difficult; people often have different interpretations of what justice is and what it should entail. People may try to game the system by entering court with ulterior motives or exaggerating their claims, which can make justice seem out of reach. As such, justice may seem far from us in some cases. Additionally, justice is often times hindered by people lying or manipulating the system to get what they want. Ultimately, truth and justice can be difficult to attain if one departs from what is considered right.
2732	No one enters a court of law with complete certainty; litigants often rely on exaggerated pleas, presenting half-truths and concealing evidence to sway decisions in their favour. This makes it difficult for justice to emerge unscathed; truth is sometimes obscured, and justice tends to withdraw from the situation.
2733	Courts are necessary to settle disputes, but litigation is often expensive and time-consuming, which makes it difficult to access for those who can least afford it. This makes it difficult to get a fair judgement in some instances, resulting in a feeling that justice is not accessible.
2734	No one enters a lawsuit without considerable fear; no one goes to court without apprehension. Litigation can be intimidating, with parties relying on their arguments to succeed and weighing their words carefully. Moreover, justice can be hard to come by, as truth often seems to be lacking in the legal process. Truth is often twisted and manipulated, and justice is often delayed or denied.
2735	CarCraze --- while it is certainly possible to negotiate a manageable payment plan with the creditor, it is important to seek legal counsel to ensure that the plan is both satisfactory to the creditor and workable for the consumer.
2736	CarCraze --- I understand your concern and it is important to take court orders seriously as failure to do so could result in serious consequences. However, it is worth noting that a court order is an order from the court which means that it has legal power and is enforceable by the court. While the court does have the power to require you to appear in court, it is important to take appropriate steps to ensure that the court order is followed. It is best to contact the court to confirm the docket number, as well as to find out when the hearing date is.
2737	CarCraze --- as you mentioned, Courts have the power to enforce Judgments and issue Court Orders, such as a Writ of Execution, to collect a debt. If the Court Order is on Court paper and has a case number, you should call the Court to confirm the Docket Number, and find out when the hearing date is. Yes, that Court Order is equivalent to a Subpoena. It is best to seek legal counsel and come up with a manageable payment plan that is satisfactory to your creditor and workable for you.
2738	CarCraze --- while it is possible to seek a payment plan that is acceptable to the creditor and workable for the debtor, it is important to seek legal counsel and come up with a manageable payment plan that accommodates both parties' needs. In some instances, simply ignoring the court order or debt can lead to worsening consequences, so it is best to be proactive in managing the situation.
2739	CarCraze --- You are correct, the Court does have the power to compel attendance and answer to a motion. It is wise to contact the Court to confirm the Docket Number and the hearing date. The Court may be able to provide additional information about the case, such as the motion or debt that is the subject of the hearing. As you noted, it is a good idea to seek legal counsel and come up with a manageable payment plan that is satisfactory to the creditor and workable for the consumer.
2740	Attending jury duty is a civic responsibility that all citizens have to fulfill. However, there are certain criteria that can grant you exemption. It is necessary to appear in person for the judge to review your petition or request and dismiss you legally. In the courtroom, it is important to be respectful and mindful of the proceedings, as any form of disruption can result in penalties.
2741	Attending jury duty can be time-consuming, but it is important to do so if you are called upon. There are criteria you can fulfill to be excused from service, but you must still attend and submit your request to the judge for approval. You should be polite and respectful in the courtroom, as the judge may require you to answer questions and could result in penalties if you do not comply.
2742	Jury duty can be a inconvenience, as we all have busy schedules to adhere to. However, you may be excused from service in some circumstances, such as if you appear in court with a valid reason for missing jury duty. Generally, the judge will review your petition or request and dismiss you accordingly. As with any legal process, it is important to be mindful of the rules and regulations.
2743	In some cases, a juror may be excused from service if they satisfy certain criteria. Jurors must still attend court and let the judge review their petition/request. It is important to be polite and respectful in the courtroom to avoid any issues. Being held in contempt of court or charged with perjury can be expensive.
2744	In some instances, such as if you have a valid reason, you may be excused from jury duty; however, you must still appear in court and the judge will consider your request. Being excused from jury duty is sometimes difficult, so it is important to be aware of the rules in the courtroom.
2745	Ever since Bush got away with tax-payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear of a backlash from the religious community, there has been a movement in this country to increase the role of churches and religious organizations in governing.   People may not realize it, but churches in general are very powerful, economically and socially. In regards to China, there is no way that the government can interfere with religious practices without facing significant resistance from the religious community.
2746	Ever since Bush got away with taxpayer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is constitutional but has been met with controversy, there has been a movement in this country to expand the role of religion in public life.   People may not realize how powerful the Catholic Church is; however, its wealth has grown significantly over time. China's implementation of its own rules has been met with opposition from some religious groups.
2747	Ever since the Bush administration was able to get funding for Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional, there has been a movement in this country to increase the role of churches and other religious organizations.   People may be unaware of the wealth and power of the Catholic Church, but it is a major force worldwide. China's restrictions on religion have raised concerns among religious organizations.
2748	Since the Bush administration was allowed to use taxpayer dollars to fund Faith-based Initiatives, a move that is clearly unconstitutional, there has been a movement in this country to give more power to religious institutions. People may be surprised to learn how wealthy the Catholic Church is; there is no denying that China's policies go against the Church's rules.
2749	Ever since Bush got away with tax-payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear of being labeled anti-church, there has been a movement in this country to give more power to religious organizations. People do not realize how wealthy the Catholic Church is; research shows that it is a major economic force. China's control of its own rules is a concern, and it remains to be seen if this trend will be allowed to continue.
2750	Australia has limited human rights under the constitution, which are established primarily by the courts. In regards to the issue at hand, it is possible to contact a women's legal service or shelter for advice on what steps to take.
2751	Australia has certain human rights under our Constitution, although these rights are established primarily by the courts. In relation to your issue, you could contact a women’s legal service or a women’s shelter for advice on what steps to take. It is possible that the perpetrator has also injured the baby, but I am not a lawyer and cannot provide certain information about this.
2752	Australia has limited rights under its Constitution, with these rights typically established by the courts. In terms of the issue you raised, it is best to contact a women's legal service or shelter for further guidance and advice.
2753	Australia does have some basic rights established by the Constitution, although these rights are largely interpreted by the courts. In terms of your issue, you can contact a women’s legal service or a women’s shelter for advice on what steps to take. While I am not a lawyer, I am aware that the courts may be able to help protect your child if there is a risk of abuse.
2754	Australia does have some basic human rights under the Constitution, although these rights are generally established by the courts. In regards to your issue, you could contact a women's legal service or a women's shelter for advice about what options are available to you.
2755	It cannot be handled in one court case. Theft is a crime, and filing a lawsuit involves both civil and criminal court. The District Attorney’s Office is typically the only option for prosecution, as they are more willing to handle criminal charges than civil charges. If you lose in criminal court, your case could be sunk; however, if you win, you will be in a better position to pursue legal action against the witness you believe lied, either in civil court or Small Claims Court.
2756	It can't be handled in one trial. Theft is criminal and civil, and the DA may not be willing to pursue it. If you don't have a lawyer, your best option is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself at the criminal trial. If the DA wins, your case may be sunk; however, if the DA loses, you may be in a better position to sue the witness you believe lied. You may be able to sue in civil court, and you could have an opportunity to sue in Small Claims Court without a lawyer.
2757	It may be better to handle these cases in two separate trials—a criminal trial and a civil trial. The criminal charges could put a greater burden on the defendant than civil charges, so it is best to plan ahead. It is possible to use civil court to pursue a lawsuit if necessary.
2758	It is best to handle these cases in separate trials in order to ensure a more favorable outcome. Theft is a crime, while prosecution and contract violations are civil in nature. The DA may be more willing to settle if you have a lawyer by your side. If the DA wins, you may be in a better position to file a civil lawsuit. You may be able to file in Small Claims Court without a lawyer.
2759	It cannot be handled in one trial.  Theft is a criminal offense, and malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil offenses.  The DA may not be willing to pursue it due to a lack of evidence; however, if you are able to present your evidence at a criminal trial, you will be in a better position to file a civil lawsuit.  You can file a civil lawsuit in court, though it may be difficult to do so without a lawyer.
2760	The US, by joining these agreements, will face higher costs of implementing new technologies in order to meet the standards. This is due to the fact that these agreements will be fully implemented in the US while some third world countries may lack the financial power and expertise to do so. This will enable the US to gain benefits in the long run as there is only one planet.
2761	The agreement could put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in the US, requiring America to upgrade a large number of industries in order to adhere to the standards. This could result in the US having an edge in industrial production compared to third world countries, which lack the financial power and expertise to implement the agreement.
2762	The US is concerned that signing the environmental agreement will cause it to lose its edge in industrial production. The agreement will place stricter emissions limits on various industries in America, which could require major investments on America's part to ensure full implementation. As other countries may not have the financial power or expertise to implement the standards, Third World countries could continue polluting while the US invests in new technologies and produces expensive products.
2763	Bush is concerned that the environmental agreement could potentially put the US at risk of losing its edge in industrial production. The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in America, requiring the US to invest heavily in order to implement new technologies and produce expensive products.
2764	The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in the US, which could require America to upgrade a large number of industries in order to meet the standards. This could put the US at risk of losing its edge in industrial production compared to other countries.
2765	The Computer Misuse Act, 1993, states that if someone uses another person's computer service without permission, they can be prosecuted. It is likely that the law has been in effect since then, as router usage and legislation evolves over time. While it is true that routers generally belong to someone, it is still possible to access networks if they are not in a secure zone, such as a public Wi-Fi area.
2766	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, was enacted in 1993, and it is clear that using another person's computer service (in this case, someone's broadband connection) without permission is an offence.   I am uncertain of the Act's legislative history, but it is likely that the law was in place when it was enacted in 1993. As such, if the friends were caught using the other party's router, they could be prosecuted.
2767	The Computer Misuse Act, 1993, states that if someone uses another person's computer service (in this case, someone's broadband connection) without permission, they can be prosecuted. This law has been in place since 1993, and while the facts of the case suggest that the activity was recent, it is still likely that prosecution could occur.
2768	The Computer Misuse Act, 1993, states that using another person's computer service without permission is an offense. It is likely that the Act was in place at the time of its enactment, meaning that the offense could still be prosecuted if it was recently accessed. While it is true that routers often belong to a specific person, one must still be aware that access is typically through a private network.
2769	The Computer Misuse Act, 1990, states that if someone uses another person's computer service without permission, they can be prosecuted. The law has been in place since 1993, indicating that it has been active throughout this time.  It is likely that the crime could result in prosecution if the activity happened recently.  While it is true that routers need to belong to somebody, it is still possible to access a network without knowing the network's details if one is not in a free wireless zone, such as McDonald's, as the connection is generally via a privately owned network.
2770	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly do not respect others beliefs and truths. We cannot judge an entire religion by a few extreme cases. What is the difference?
2771	I understand your point and I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths. The main difference is that some people are more affected by terrorism than others, so people react differently.
2772	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly do not respect others beliefs and truths. While we may not agree with the actions of the bombers, it is still up to the government to take action in order to protect its people. It is difficult to judge without knowing the full context. There is no clear difference between these events and what is currently happening in Iraq. We must be mindful of the fact that violence is still violence, regardless of who is being targeted.
2773	Nuitsen, I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly do not respect others' beliefs and truths.  What is the difference? In Islam, non-violence is a core value and suicide bombing is an exception, not the norm.
2774	I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but they were done in response to the suicide bombers and they certainly do not respect others beliefs and truths. We cannot judge an entire religion based on the actions of a few extremists. There have been cases of Christians and Muslims living peacefully side by side in some areas, so it is possible for different faiths to coexist.
2775	Being in the police academy can be quite intensive and stressful. Yes, I was supportive of him during this time. I believe that it is important to support your partner in these situations, as it allows them to further their career.
2776	Being in the police academy can be quite intense and stressful, which can be challenging for a relationship. I understand that this may have caused issues between you. Is it possible that you were feeling unsupported during this period? It is important to have a supportive relationship in order to balance each other and foster a healthy relationship.
2777	Being in the police academy can be very intense and stressful. I understand that it was important to your partner to further his/her career in this way, and I am supportive of that. Being in a relationship, especially during a period of increased closeness and intimacy, can be challenging, and it is natural to have individual needs that can clash at times. Though I am understanding of the decision, I can also recognize that it was an important part of the relationship for you.
2778	Being in the police academy can be quite intensive and stressful, which could be difficult for a relationship. However, if both people are committed to a relationship, it is possible to make it work. Although it may be difficult for the couple at times, it is possible to overcome these issues and stay together.
2779	Being in the police academy can be quite intensive and stressful.  Were you supportive of him during this time? Yes, I understand that some compromise may have to be made in relationships, but it is important to make sure both parties feel respected. It is understandable that this could be a factor in a relationship if it causes too much strain.
2780	Legal majority age is 18 in most states, but there are exceptions in most custody agreements which may require support until high school is completed, depending on the state. It can be difficult to deal with, but she is your daughter and you as her parents have the right and responsibility to ensure she has the support she needs. You are correct that you are not obligated to pay rent for an 18 year old. If she chools and lives on her own, it is ultimately her decision. You can encourage her to finish school but ultimately the decision is hers.
2781	In most states, the legal majority age is 18, however, some states require support through high school if custody agreements specify this. It appears that your daughter may need additional support, and you as her parent should consider talking to her to determine what she needs to ensure her well-being. Depending on your state, legal majority age is 19. In the meantime, you should keep an eye on her situation, and be there to provide the support she needs.
2782	In most states, the legal age of majority is 18, but there are sometimes exceptions in custody agreements that allow support to be given through high school, depending on the situation. It can be difficult to watch your daughter make these decisions, but ultimately it is her choice. As the parent, you have no legal obligation to pay rent for an 18-year-old. If she chooses to move out, she will have to make these decisions independently. You can continue to provide emotional support and guidance, but it is up to her to make these decisions and take the necessary steps to provide for herself.
2783	In most states, the legal age for emancipation is 18, but in some cases, the courts may require the individual to remain dependent on the custodial parent until they turn 18 or graduate high school. It sounds like your daughter is in a difficult situation, and while you cannot force her to move back in with her father, you are not obligated to pay for her rent unless she is living with you. If she wants to move back in, you can make that arrangement, but if she wants more independence, she will need to make her own choices and take responsibility for her own decisions.
2784	In most states, the minimum legal age for emancipation is 18, although there may be special circumstances in the case that allow for exceptions. It sounds like your daughter needs some extra support, as this can be a difficult time to go through. You as the parent do not have an obligation to pay rent for an 18 year old living independently; this can be difficult to deal with. While it is possible for the child to move in with their father, you as the custodial parent do not have to provide financial support in this situation. If the child is still living with you, different states have different laws regarding financial support.
2785	The US does not want to steal Iraq’s oil; it needs to control the world trade in oil. This is achieved by requiring all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars, effectively making American paper money redeemable in oil. Arab regimes also reinvest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States, which maintains America’s economic strength. If these countries are allowed to sell oil in other currencies, they will invest their profits somewhere else, which would harm the US economy.
2786	The US wants to maintain control over the global trade in oil, which is why it requires all oil-producing countries to sell their oil in U.S. dollars. This gives America access to the revenue from these countries' oil profits and enables them to invest these funds in the U.S. economy. If countries are allowed to sell their oil in other currencies, this could hurt the U.S. economy significantly.
2787	US does not want to steal Iraq's oil, as this would deprive the US of its leverage over other countries that produce oil. To ensure that US paper money remains the primary medium of trade for oil, the US government has forced countries such as Iraq to continue selling their oil in US dollars, which gives the US a significant advantage over its competitors.
2788	The US seeks to maintain control over the global trade in oil by requiring oil-producing countries to sell their oil in US dollars, thus making US paper money widely acceptable for oil purchases. This ensures that oil-producing countries invest their profits in US Treasury bonds and other assets that benefit the US economy.
2789	The US does not want to steal Iraq’s oil; it needs to control the world trade in oil. By requiring all oil-producing countries to sell their oil in US dollars, America ensures that its paper money remains redeemable in oil. This gives America an effective monopoly on the oil trade. Moreover, Iraq and other countries are required to invest their oil profits in the US, helping to maintain America’s influence over the oil trade.
2790	I believe that the decision should be left to the owner of the property. I have yet to be in a place where smoke bothers me; most places here in Ohio are non-smoking, and I have no issue with that. Clean air initiatives are a way of raising funds to improve air quality; I would rather have that money go to my child's college fund.
2791	I believe it should be the owner's choice when it comes to smoking in their establishments. In Ohio, most places are non-smoking, which does not bother me. Bars, however, may still have a strong smell of cigarettes on clothes and hair the next day. That is one way of people controlling and getting money, as well as raising funds for clean air initiatives. I prefer my money going towards my child's college fund rather than being taken by the government.
2792	I believe that the choice should be left to the owners of the property, as smoke can be an issue for some people. In my experience, most places are non-smoking, but bars in Ohio are not allowed to be smoking, which does not bother me.  This is just one way of people trying to control and generate money; the issues on the ballot state that the revenue generated can go towards a “clean air fund”, which raises the question of why such a fund is needed if smoke is restricted.  I prefer my money to go towards my child’s college fund; if the law passes, this could limit my choice.
2793	I believe that it should be the choice of the business owner whether or not to allow smoking. I have yet to be somewhere where second-hand smoke bothers me; most places in Ohio are non-smoking, so I am not bothered by it. However, the smell of smoke may linger in my clothes and hair the next day. This is an issue of control that some states are considering, which seems to be the trend these days. If smoking is banned in certain areas, will businesses be allowed to choose whether or not to allow smoking or will it be mandated by the government?
2794	I don't believe that it should be the government's choice; I believe it should be the property owner's choice. While I have yet to be in a place where smoke bothers me, I have found that most bars in Ohio are non-smoking, which does not bother me. As for money for a "clean air fund," it is an issue on the ballot; I agree that it is odd that this fund would be needed if smoking is banned. I prefer my money to go towards my child's college fund.  In my opinion, the government should not be able to choose whether or not smoking is allowed; this decision should be left up to the property owner.
2795	If you are with your children, supervising them, a registry is unnecessary since it is the parent's responsibility to do so. Horrific crimes against children primarily involve relatives or close friends, rather than strangers, emphasizing the importance of parental supervision. Registries do nothing to enhance security.
2796	If you are with your children, supervising them, the responsibility of parental supervision is maintained. Look at the statistics of horrific crimes against children; these crimes primarily occur from someone known to the child, within the family or close friends. In addition, registries provide only a false sense of security.
2797	If you are with your children, supervising them, a registry is unnecessary as it is the parent's responsibility to ensure safety. While it is true that most sexual offenses occur within close proximity, it is still important to protect children from potential dangers. Furthermore, registries offer a sense of security that can be beneficial for parents.
2798	If you are with your children, supervising them, a registry is not necessary to help ensure their safety. It is your responsibility as a parent to keep an eye on your children at all times. Statistically, 90-95% of sex offenses occur within families or among close friends, emphasizing the importance of adult supervision. Registries offer a false sense of security in these cases.
2799	If you are with your children, supervising them, the government does not need to require a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. While sexual assaults against children are rare, they tend to happen between people the child knows, such as family members or close friends. Stranger danger is not as common, and these registries offer no real security.
2800	In the state of Georgia, a child under 18 years old cannot move out of their parents’ home without permission, unless another guardian is appointed or the minor is emancipated. Although the law is on the books, law enforcement usually does not enforce it due to the cost.
2801	In the state of Georgia, as of 2006, a child under 18 years old cannot move out of their parents’ home without permission, unless another guardian is appointed or the minor is emancipated. The law enforcement does not enforce this law due to the cost; it would require millions of dollars in resources. Most police officers are not up to date on juvenile laws.
2802	In the state of Georgia, as of 2006, a minor aged 17 years or under cannot move out of their parent’s home without permission. If a guardian is not appointed, or if the minor is not emancipated, the law is generally not enforced due to the cost. Most police officers are not aware of the details of the law.
2803	In the state of Georgia, children under the age of 18 are required to live with their parents unless another guardian is appointed or the child is emancipated. The law enforcement does not strictly enforce this law due to the cost of enforcement and the lack of knowledge of juvenile laws among police officers.
2804	In the state of Georgia, a child under the age of 18 generally cannot move out of their parents’ home without their permission, unless another guardian is appointed or the minor is emancipated. This law is usually enforced by the courts to ensure the minor’s best interests are taken into consideration. However, this law is rarely enforced by law enforcement due to the cost.
2805	Giving two weeks' notice is generally a good idea in order to maintain a positive relationship with the employer and to ensure a future reference, but I have never heard of a state requiring this.
2806	In most states, including Louisiana, it is typically not required for an employee to give notice when terminating an employment relationship, but it is often a courtesy to give two weeks' notice. If the employee wants to maintain a good relationship with the employer or obtain a good reference later, it is advisable to give two weeks' notice.
2807	In most states, it is common courtesy for employers and employees to provide two weeks' notice before terminating an employment relationship. While I am unsure of Louisiana law, I have never heard of a state requiring such. Giving such notice is advisable to maintain a good relationship with the employer and to obtain a good reference later.
2808	The first answerer may be correct; I am not aware of any laws in Louisiana that require notice, but it is typically a courtesy to give two weeks' notice before terminating employment. Giving two weeks' notice can help maintain a good relationship with the employer and may be advisable to ensure a good reference in the future.
2809	In Louisiana, it is not uncommon for employers and employees to offer two weeks notice before terminating an employment relationship. While this is usually done out of courtesy, it is advisable to give two weeks' notice in order to maintain a good relationship with the employer and to have a good reference in the future.
2810	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments, service providers have the right to discontinue their services to you.  Service providers typically have the right to terminate services if payments are not made on time. This could affect any customer regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.  While providers may give customers some leeway in making payments on time, they ultimately have the right to enforce such policies.
2811	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against.  If you miss your payments, the provider may choose to discontinue their services to you. Depending on the contract, they may give you a warning or allowance to catch up on payments. However, if you choose to not pay on time, there are consequences.
2812	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments, service providers have the right to discontinue their services to you. While this can lead to increased costs and inconvenience, it is within the service provider's rights.  Sounds as though they have given you some leniency and you have the right to choose whether or not to pay your bills on time. As a customer, you have the right to do so if you pay your bills on time.
2813	Yes, it is necessary to pay bills on time in order to maintain services. Missed payments may lead to the discontinuation of services, regardless of the color of the service. It is important to maintain a good credit history in order to access services.
2814	It seems that you are looking for a service that will provide special privileges regardless of your race or ethnicity. If you miss your payments, the provider reserves the right to discontinue their services to you. While they may provide some leniency in regards to payment terms, this is generally not the case.  As such, it is important to keep track of and pay your bills on time in order to avoid any penalties.
2815	The sheriff's department does not have the authority to initiate sales, as they are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossessors, nor are they involved in any sales processes. Instead, they allow parties to collect cars or other items, or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
2816	The sheriff's department does not have the authority to conduct sales; they are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossessors, nor are they involved in collection procedures. Their legal authority lies in ensuring that evictions are conducted in a safe and legal manner.
2817	The sheriff's department does not have the authority to sell the items; they are not in the business of being creditors/liquidators/repossessors, nor are they involved in sales or evictions. They can only ensure that the items are collected or that an eviction is carried out safely and legally.
2818	The sheriff's department does not have the authority to order sales, as they are not involved in the process of collections or repossessions. They can only allow a party to collect goods or evict tenants legally.
2819	The sheriff's department does not have the authority to seize or liquidate items; they are limited to evicting tenants or allowing a party to collect items when necessary. In some cases, they may be involved in collecting vehicles, but this is the exception rather than the rule. They cannot act as collection agencies as they lack the legal authority to do so.
2820	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited, even if the legal systems differ in terms of fairness. It is understandable that courts that have the accused before them may want to be reasonably sure that there is a strong case against them before sending them abroad.
2821	No one objects when those who COMMIT crimes are extradited, even if it means that justice is served across different legal systems. According to international law, courtss that have the accused in their jurisdiction will want to be convinced that there is a solid case before they send them abroad.
2822	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited, as justice should be served even if criminals flee. However, our legal systems differ in terms of fairness, which means courts need to be fairly convinced that a case is strong before they send the accused abroad.
2823	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited, even if justice systems differ in terms of fairness. Courts that have accused persons before them will want to be fairly convinced that a case exists before sending them abroad.
2824	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited, even if the legal systems differ in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts want to be convinced that there is a solid case to answer before sending the accused abroad.
2825	Because some laws may not have been immediately perceived as problematic when first enacted, there is no guarantee that a law will always remain sensible in hindsight. What is sensible may depend on the context and the values of the society at the time. Laws are sometimes changed or removed when they are no longer considered necessary.
2826	Laws can be changed or repealed if they are no longer considered effective or necessary, allowing for the evolution of regulations to match the changing environment. Similarly, what is considered ‘stupid’ today may not necessarily have been ‘stupid’ when it was enacted, as legislation responds to the social standards of its time. It is ultimately up to the legislative body to determine if a law is necessary or not.
2827	In some cases, laws that are made to protect the public's health and safety may have been necessary even if they would not have been seen as necessary in the past. Regulations can become outdated over time and may need to be modified or removed if they are no longer useful.
2828	Laws can change in response to different social and economic contexts, and some laws that may currently seem unnecessary or unwise may have been necessary to protect public health and safety when enacted. What may seem stupid now may have been seen as necessary then.
2829	Because some laws are able to remain in effect over time, such as laws regulating the consumption of meat, while the reasons behind them may no longer be applicable. It is more likely that the laws are still in place simply due to inertia, rather than being necessary to protect public safety. Laws can be repealed when they are no longer necessary.
2830	It wasn't just the Jews; the Nazis had a vision of creating a master race, and they did whatever they could to accomplish this vision. They were not acting out of hate; they simply saw Jews, and other groups, as inferior and without rights. Although they may have had different ideas for other groups, such as those in the Soviet Union, their actions were still brutal.
2831	It wasn't just the Jews; the Nazis had a master race concept that they were attempting to create. They believed that certain racial and ethnic groups were inferior and did not fit into their vision of a master race. They were not acting out of hatred; they were simply using the same cruel methods we use to experiment on animals or give them horrible living conditions. We tend to view ourselves as better than that and them as inferior, with no rights or feelings. That is what the Nazis did to various groups. Stalin was harsh in his own way, with his own ideas of what was right and wrong; he enforced the Harvest of Despair documentary.
2832	It wasn't just the Jews, as the Nazis saw it; the master race was their ultimate goal. They believed that the Jews, as well as other groups, were inferior and posed a threat to achieving this vision. They used cruel methods to accomplish this vision, which were not meant to express hatred but rather to accomplish what they deemed right.  While Stalin was cruel to anyone he could treat cruelly, the Nazis had a more targeted approach in terms of the groups they chose to eradicate.
2833	The Nazis had a concept of a master race, which they believed would be created through selective breeding of those with desirable traits. They believed that these people would be able to create a better society and future for Germany. They were not motivated by hatred, but rather by a desire to create what they saw as a better future.
2834	It wasn't just the Jews, as the Nazis saw it; they believed that the master race should be created through selective breeding of people who they perceived as inferior. Yes, their actions were fueled by a twisted ideology, but they did whatever they could to accomplish this vision of a master race. They were not exactly hating the people, but they were simply using the same cruelty that we use when we experiment on animals or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We tend to view ourselves as better than that, and them as inferior and without any right to live happily.
2835	In my opinion, no. While the child is young, this could cause them to feel isolated and be teased by their peers, which would cause them emotional stress. During this vital stage of their development, their sense of identity and security needs the presence of both parents, as well as a supportive and stable environment.
2836	In my opinion, no. It is important to consider how this could affect the child early on, as it enters school. Other children could tease the child and this could cause emotional stress for the child. This could also confuse the child, and I believe that children need both a mother and a father, as well as a supportive environment for proper development.
2837	In my opinion, no. While this could work in some instances, children need both a mother and a father for optimal development. Attending school could be difficult for the child as he or she gets older, due to possible bullying from their peers. This could confuse the child and create emotional stress and problems.
2838	In my opinion, no. Allowing two parents of the same gender to raise a child could cause emotional stress and disruption at an early age, especially when the child enters school. This could also make the child feel different and isolated from his or her peers.
2839	In my opinion, no. While it may not have a significant effect on the child at an early age, once the child enters school, other children may tease the child and this could cause emotional stress and anxiety for the child. Furthermore, having two parents of the same gender instead of a mother and a father could be confusing for the child. I believe that having both a mother and a father is important for a child's development.
2840	The Establishment Clause is the relevant part here. The relevant issue is not the Free Exercise Clause, but the Establishment Clause. This means that, while religious reasons cannot be used to justify laws, neither can laws based on other religious beliefs. This prevents the majority from being able to make laws based on their religion.
2841	The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from enacting laws which are based on religious grounds, so it is not the Free Exercise Clause which deals with discrimination against gays. Thus, the issue is not freedom of religion, but rather the Establishment Clause which prevents the government from enacting laws based on religion.
2842	The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, as the majority may be, with the belief that their religion is the only valid one. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination.
2843	The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prevents legislation from being based on religious reasons, as it applies to both a legislature's majority religion and any other religion. Therefore, the issue is not the Free Exercise Clause, but the Establishment Clause.
2844	The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits laws which are based on religious grounds. This means that a religious minority cannot use its beliefs to impose its views on another religious group. While an individual's religious beliefs are certainly valid, these cannot be used to create or enforce laws.
2845	I think this policy could be beneficial. It equalizes the school experience for students by providing a level playing field in terms of clothing. This may help boost students' self-esteem and allow them to focus more on their schoolwork.
2846	I believe this could be beneficial for students. By requiring uniforms, all students at the school will be on a relatively equal playing field in terms of appearance. This could help boost the self-esteem of those who are financially disadvantaged and may not have many clothes or access to clothes, which in turn could enable them to focus more on their schoolwork.
2847	I think this could be beneficial for students. By providing uniforms, everyone at the school is given a equal opportunity in terms of their appearance, which can positively affect their self-esteem and allow them to focus more on their education.
2848	I think this policy could be beneficial for students. It provides equitable learning opportunities for students, as clothing restrictions are alleviated and students do not need to worry as much about their clothing. This can help improve their self-esteem, allowing them to concentrate more on their studies.
2849	I believe this policy could be beneficial. It will create a level playing field for all students at the school, allowing those with fewer resources to have access to uniforms without having to worry about it. Additionally, this will help to boost the students' self-esteem and allow them to concentrate more on their studies.
2850	Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.   Capital punishment carries the risk that innocent people may be executed. Additionally, due to the subjectivity of sentencing, it is possible that sentences are weighted in favor of the wealthy, thereby disadvantaging the poor.
2851	Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.   Capital punishment carries the risk of executing innocent people, as judgments can be affected by personal prejudice and financial constraints depending on the availability of the best lawyers.
2852	Capital punishment is an ineffective deterrent for crime and can lead to the execution of innocent people. Furthermore, it is difficult to ensure that justice is completely impartial and free from prejudice, meaning that socio-economic factors can still play a role in determining sentences.
2853	Any society that values the worth of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system. Capital punishment carries the risk of executing innocent people, which could occur if judgments are based on personal prejudice or economic privilege.
2854	Having a justice system that values human life and promotes non-violent solutions is important to ensure justice is served. Capital punishment carries the risk of executing innocent people, which can occur if judgments are based on prejudice and biases. In addition, the sentences can be influenced by financial resources available to the defense and prosecution.
2855	If government intervention is limited to what parents and guardians can do to educate their children, then no. In terms of content available via broadcasting and digital media, yes. However, the government should also set clear standards to ensure these media outlets adhere to these regulations.
2856	If the government wants to intervene in parental decisions about how to raise their children, this is generally acceptable. However, government regulations should also set clear standards in this regard. Parents should instead take responsibility for teaching their children right from wrong and maintain open communication with them.
2857	If the government is regulating what children can view or access online, then no. With regards to content transmitted through public airwaves and available for public display, yes. However, the government should also set strict regulations in place to protect children from inappropriate content.   Parents should take the initiative and teach their children right from wrong, as well as maintain open lines of communication with them.
2858	If government intervention is limited to protecting minors from viewing inappropriate content, then no. With regards to the FCC and what is transmitted over the airwaves and available for public display, yes. However, the government should also set specific guidelines in this regard.   Parents should take the lead in teaching their children right from wrong and maintain open communication with them.
2859	If the government is able to regulate what children can view on television or via the internet, it should also set specific guidelines for these media outlets. However, parents should take responsibility for teaching their children right from wrong and maintain an open line of communication with them.
2860	My thoughts have always been: I'm Irish and I don't feel that Notre Dame's nickname is offensive.  I understand that some Native Americans have concerns with the name, but I think there are more pressing issues to focus on, such as poverty on the reservations and poor educational opportunities.
2861	My opinion has always been that Notre Dame's nickname is not an issue. I do not feel offended in any way, since people think the school's nickname is linked to Irish culture. There are more serious matters to look into, such as the lack of educational resources in reservations and poor schooling.
2862	Here is my thought: I am Irish American, and while I have some issues with the use of Native American symbols and names by universities, I do not believe it is the most pressing issue. There are much bigger issues such as poverty on reservations and poor schooling that should be addressed first.
2863	I have always been okay with Notre Dame's use of the "Fighting Irish" nickname; I recognize that it is an integral part of their school identity. While I understand that some Native Americans may be concerned about this issue, I believe that there are larger issues of poverty and poor education on Native American reservations that should be a priority for action.
2864	My opinion has always been that Notre Dame's nickname is not problematic. I do not believe that my heritage is being mocked, nor do I feel that the school's name goes against my identity. There are much more pressing issues to tackle in terms of educational opportunities and living conditions on reservations.
2865	Answer is NO! While it is difficult to know for sure, I believe that leaks of classified information can have a real impact on troop safety and operations, as it can give our enemies important information that could put our troops at risk. This can have serious implications for operations on the ground and lengthen the conflict.
2866	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as it can have implications for the safety of troops and the success of operations. Newspapers have a responsibility to minimize this risk, especially when it comes to reporting on ongoing wars.
2867	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as it can potentially damage national security and put people in danger. Newspapers have a responsibility to ensure information is appropriately redacted and that sources are protected in order to prevent this from occurring.
2868	Yes, the leaking of classified information can be a serious problem as it can potentially jeopardize military and intelligence operations. There have been cases where leaked information has given our enemies an advantage, which can have serious implications for operations and safety. This is a concern as newspapers often have access to such information, which they can then publish.
2869	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as this can have a serious impact on operational security and thus cause deaths on the battlefield. It is a risk to national security that the press is able to access and publish such information, which could give our enemies an advantage.
2870	Marriage is a lifelong commitment that is traditionally celebrated with a ceremony and supported by legal recognition. While legal recognition is important to demonstrate the couple’s commitment, marriage is first and foremost a personal declaration of love and trust. It should be celebrated and respected by the couple, with a ceremony they both find meaningful, and with thoughts on the future and the expressed love.
2871	Marriage is a lifelong commitment that should be celebrated with a ceremony that is meaningful to the couple. Although legally recognizing the marriage is important, the couple should also share their thoughts on the future and express their love for one another. It is important to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of the life.
2872	Marriage is a lifelong commitment that should be celebrated with the couple involved. Holding a ceremony somewhere special and sharing these thoughts on the future and expressing love are important components of a marriage. It is important to continue this thinking throughout life.
2873	Marriage is a lifelong commitment that ideally should be celebrated with a ceremony that couples share together. However, the legal aspect of marriage can be confirmed between two partners through their words and the promise of a future together. As couples, it is important to continuously reaffirm this commitment through words and thoughts.
2874	Marriage is a lifelong commitment that should be celebrated with the couple, as it is their relationship and love that matters most. It is important to express these feelings to each other and to continue thinking about the future in everyday life.
2875	Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crack pot conspiracy theorist...first, the US Immigration policies have become stricter in recent years, so it is possible that the client may face difficulty entering the US. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect.   Honestly, I am glad that your client's entry into the US may be restricted, as certain countries have placed restrictions on entry for certain individuals in order to ensure public safety.
2876	Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crackpot conspiracy theorist. While I understand the points you make about immigration policies, I believe that the current system has flaws that go beyond the scope of this argument. Second, the racism charges in your “question” make it highly suspect.
2877	Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crack pot conspiracy theorist. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. Honestly, I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the US, as some countries have stricter policies on immigration than others and certain individuals may be allowed entry depending on the circumstances.
2878	I understand your concern, but it is important to note that the US immigration policies do not necessarily take into account whether an individual has access to education or health care when making decisions regarding admittance. This means that there is no consistent standard applied when determining if an individual is allowed entry into the US.
2879	Your client? Give me a break man...you are some crack pot conspiracy theorist...first there is no consistent question within your rant of improperly formed English (incomplete) sentences. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. However, I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the US, as he could pose potential security risks if allowed to enter the country.
2880	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in civil proceedings.  It is sometimes available in these cases, depending on the jurisdiction.  However, the availability and strength of this defense can vary significantly from state to state.  It is best to consult an attorney who is licensed in the state in which the case would be filed for the most accurate information.
2881	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in civil proceedings in some states, but its availability and restrictions vary from state to state.  Generally, the defense of temporary insanity is much less common in civil proceedings than in criminal proceedings.  In some states, the defense of permanent insanity may be more available than the defense of temporary insanity.  The availability and restrictions of both defenses vary greatly from state to state.
2882	If a civil action is filed, the defendant can argue that the plaintiff suffered mental anguish. Depending on the state, this could be a viable claim. The facts of the case, including the fact that it is a marriage that appears to be troubled, could make it unlikely for a jury to award her much in damages. The laws governing this vary greatly from state to state. It is best to consult an attorney licensed in the state to get the most accurate information.
2883	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in civil proceedings.  It can be used in certain circumstances, depending on the state.  However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare.  Some states do not allow it at all.  Others, just like the "permanent" insanity defense, restrict it considerably.   Mental anguish is a tort.  It is possible for a plaintiff to win a mental anguish claim in certain cases, depending on the state's laws.  The court will consider the nature and severity of the plaintiff's injury, as well as any pre-existing emotional or mental health conditions.  The court will also consider the defendant's state of mind and actions that caused the injury.  The jury will weigh all the evidence and determine the amount of damages awarded.  The jury will also consider the plaintiff's emotional distress.
2884	If the female sued the male for damages, that would be a civil action. The defense of temporary insanity is generally unavailable in civil proceedings. However, some states do not allow it at all, while others restrict it heavily. Mental anguish is a tort, and it is unlikely that a jury would award her substantial compensation in such a case, due to the nature of the relationship between the two parties. The laws in this area vary greatly between states. Consulting an attorney who is familiar with the relevant laws in the given state would be the best source of accurate information.
2885	It can be restricting to live in a mental health facility, especially if you want to maintain your independence. While the benefits of a hospital setting can outweigh the cons, I would recommend a psychiatric ward over jail in most circumstances.
2886	It can be limiting to be required to live with a partner and share the same space, especially if one is younger and financially dependent on the other. While this can be daunting, it can also have its advantages, such as having someone to turn to for support and companionship. It is important to weigh both the pros and cons and decide what works best for the individual.
2887	It can be both interesting and scary to live with a mental illness. While hospital settings can provide a sense of safety and support, the cost of psychiatric care can be prohibitively expensive. In some cases, it may be better to live in a psychiatric ward than to live in a shared living situation or to incur a financial strain in order to get care.
2888	It can be both a blessing and a challenge to live independently. While the freedom and independence can be appealing, there are certain aspects of living on one's own that can be difficult, such as financial struggles, mental health issues, and the lack of emotional support. In some instances, psychiatric hospitals can be scary and costly, while choosing to live alone can be beneficial as there are advantages to both living situations.
2889	It can be a challenge adjusting to living arrangements in a hospital setting. While some hospitals can be overwhelming and restrictive, psychiatric wards provide a degree of support and safety that can be beneficial, particularly if you need access to other services. On the other hand, living in the community can offer more independence and freedom. Ultimately, it depends on the individual’s needs and preferences.
2890	There are numerous water companies in the US that are subject to various federal and state regulations. If the water companies comply with these regulations, there is no basis for a lawsuit, class action, or other legal challenge.   In order to prevail, you would need to demonstrate negligence on the part of the water company.
2891	There are thousands of water companies in the US that are generally regulated by various federal and state agencies. If they comply with those regulations, there is no basis for a suit, class action or otherwise. In order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence. While tap water may not be to your taste, there are other options such as drilling your own well, installing a filtration system or buying bottled water.
2892	There are typically thousands of water companies in the US, which are subject to various federal and state regulations. In order to win a suit, class action or otherwise, you would need to prove negligence. If you do not like the tap water, you can drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water.
2893	There are a large number of water companies in the US, which are typically regulated by various federal and state agencies. If they comply with these regulations, there is no basis for a lawsuit, class action or otherwise.   In order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence. If you do not like the taste or quality of tap water, you can opt to drill your own well, install a filtration system, or buy bottled water.
2894	There are numerous water companies in the US that are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. If they comply with these regulations, there is generally no cause for a lawsuit, class action or otherwise. To win a lawsuit, you would need to prove negligence. If you do not like the tap water, you can choose to drill your own well, install your own filtration system, or buy bottled water.
2895	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice.
2896	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, which could become costly if activist campaigns continue. In the long term, if activists continue, it could become expensive enough that the retailer may choose to stop selling furs due to the reduced profitability.
2897	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs; however, in the long term, if activists continued with this strategy, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it, which is not good for business.
2898	Yes and no; over the short term, it could cause the retailer to have to order more furs, as the demand could become costly for the retailer in the long run. If activists continue to do so, it could become expensive enough that the retailer might think twice about selling it, which is not ideal for businesses.
2899	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it. This could make the retailer cautious about carrying the items in their inventory.
2900	The adversarial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In this way, it is ethical, as it provides a structure for “fair play”. However, a lawyer’s job is to win for their client. Exploiting loopholes in the law is one way to gain an advantage over the opposing party. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process provides the best way to ensure justice is served, as a party that believes its claim was not handled properly can take the case further up the appellate courts. This is the best system we have.
2901	The legal system provides a structure for fair play, although lawyers have the goal of winning their cases for their clients. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is a way to gain advantage over the other party in some cases, which may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process offers the best way to redress a wrong since a party can seek further action through the appellate courts. This is the best option available.
2902	The legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement that are imposed on both parties. In this sense, it is ethical as it provides a structure for “fair play”. However, lawyers’ job is to win the case for their client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law may give an advantage to one side, which is not always ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process provides the best way to rectify any wrongs that a party might feel have occurred within the bounds of the law. In some cases, parties can seek further action through the appellate courts for a final judgment.
2903	The legal system serves to provide structure and ensure fair play, although lawyers will always strive to win for their clients. In some cases, this can be unethical. However, the legal process does provide the best way of ensuring justice is achieved, as aggrieved parties can seek further action through the appellate courts. This is the best system we have.
2904	The legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement that are imposed on both parties. In this sense, it is ethical as it provides a structure for fair play. However, lawyers’ jobs are to win cases for their clients, which can involve taking advantage of loopholes in the law. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process offers the best means of redressing a grievance when a party feels their claim was not handled properly within the bounds of the law, as appeal courts can be an option in some cases. This is the best system we have.
2905	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this can go too far if the company is not treating its employees fairly or respecting their contributions. Collective bargaining is an important part of protecting worker’s rights, providing fair wages and better working conditions.  This only grows when employees feel management is not handling them fairly.
2906	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members, however, this can go too far unless the boyfriend has done something such as crossing a picket line. This can result in him not being liked or respected.  In addition, management needs to respect and acknowledge employee’s contributions for there to be labour peace.  All in all, unions are necessary in such situations to make sure management is fair in their dealings with employees.
2907	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this might go a bit too far; unless your boyfriend has done something like crossing a picket line, then he might not be well-received or respected.  Collective bargaining agreements usually only come about when employees feel that management is not treating them fairly and respecting their contributions.  Management and labour often have different views on how to handle labour issues, which can lead to labour disputes.  However, unions can act as a bridge to increase the chances of labour peace.
2908	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a bit too far - unless your boyfriend has done something like crossing a picket line, then he could face some dislike and resentment from the other workers. This can lead to a breakdown in labour relations, which is why unions are formed.   Secondly, unions provide a way for employees to voice their grievances and feel valued by management. Management is usually willing to work with unions to find solutions and show respect for the workers’ contributions.  In this way, unions help create a healthier workplace environment.
2909	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker?  Unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this can go too far if the company is not treating its employees fairly or respecting their contributions, which can lead to labour tension.  Management and unions should try to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both sides.  However, this can only be achieved if both sides are willing to work together.
2910	Certainly, one can be very clever and have good grades, but this should not be limited solely to academic performance as these can be complemented by other experiences and opportunities. School performance is only one factor that can determine one's potential.
2911	I understand that one can achieve good grades while being diligent in their studies, however, it is not wise to limit opportunities by performing poorly in school. This is especially true if one is exposed to additional factors such as poverty or diseases that can hinder learning.
2912	Yes, grades are important, but college admissions are not the only opportunity for success. While good grades can open up more opportunities, it is possible to be successful without them. However, it is important to note that outside circumstances such as poverty or ill-health can limit academic performance.
2913	Certainly, a person can be very clever and still achieve good results in school. While grades are an important factor in getting opportunities, it is important to maintain a balance between performance and effort. Grades are a measure of knowledge mechanically applied as well as effort put in.
2914	Certainly, it is possible to be very clever and have good grades, as grades are impacted by the available opportunities. While it is true that outside circumstances, such as poverty and illness, can limit academic success, laziness can be a factor as well.
2915	I have been slowly losing my faith in morality. I tend to find the idea of morality somewhat puzzling, as it goes beyond what we can observe in the physical world and is based on assumptions that are difficult to justify. While we are bound by it, these threads are made up of something even stranger - moral rules that we must follow.   All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and thus, we should adhere to it) but I have difficulty in believing this without further evidence. It seems easier to explain the concept of morality without it - the world seems simpler and less ambiguous when this layer of morality is absent.
2916	I think morality is an important part of society, as it provides a set of guidelines to live by which can benefit everyone. Though I can understand why some people might struggle to accept this due to the difficulties in verifying such things, I believe that it is still best to abide by moral rules in order to ensure the best outcomes for everyone in society.
2917	I tend to find the whole concept of morality puzzling. There is an abstract quality to it that lies beyond the physical world which makes it difficult to justify its existence. It feels awkward to link certain actions as mandatory due to its moral imperative without something being taken as axiomatic. All moral systems seem to begin from the premise that X is good, but I cannot find any reason to believe in this mysterious rule. Why should I accept such a rule if the world seems clearer without it?
2918	I've been struggling to justify morality for a while now. We have laws and social norms in place to regulate behavior and discourage antisocial acts, but I haven't been able to form a strong belief in morality yet. There's this mysterious quality that exists beyond the physical world which we must adhere to, and I haven't been able to make that leap of faith yet. It seems easier to explain the rules of society without referring to a larger moral rule.
2919	I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd, in that while it serves as a useful framework for societies to operate within, I struggle to find a rational basis for accepting its validity. All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X) which is difficult to justify without some form of axiomatic assumption.
2920	1) A Home  No one should be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home, no one should be living on the street. Everyone should have access to safe, affordable housing and adequate shelter, regardless of their income level.   2) Food  Everyone needs food to be able to live. No one should go hungry due to lack of money.   3) Healthcare  Yes, everyone should receive equal healthcare regardless of their income or insurance situation. The government should ensure that everyone can access affordable and quality healthcare, regardless of their situation.  4) Education Yes, everyone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. This should include the option of basic education, college degrees or trade, depending on individual preferences and needs. The government should ensure access to educational opportunities for all, regardless of income level.   The government should provide funding for these programs, in order to make them accessible to all.
2921	1) A Home  Everyone should have a place to live that they can call home, regardless of their income. No one should be left without a home simply due to their economic situation.  2) Food  Food is necessary for everyone to live a healthy life, and everyone should have access to nutritious food regardless of their income level.  3) Healthcare  Healthcare should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic situation. Governments should ensure that people have access to quality healthcare, regardless of their ability to pay for it.  4) Education  Education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income. Governments should ensure that everyone has access to a basic education, either through public schools, colleges, or other forms of education.  There should be a system in place to ensure that everyone has access to quality education, regardless of their economic situation. Governments should pay for this system to provide equal access to education for everyone.     In short, everyone should have access to food, housing, healthcare and education regardless of their income. Governments should ensure this happens by providing funding for these systems, so that everyone can access them.
2922	1) A Home  No one should be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home, no one should be living on the street.   2) Food  Everyone needs food to be able to live. No reason why people should be starving.   3) Healthcare  Everyone should receive equal healthcare regardless of their insurance and money situation.  No one should be denied healthcare based on their financial circumstances.   4) Education  Everyone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. This could include attending a public school, college or university, depending on the individual's choice.   5) Healthcare and Education  The government should pay for it.  This would provide equal opportunity for education and healthcare for everyone, regardless of their financial circumstances.
2923	1) A Home  No one should be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home, no one should be living on the street.  Everyone needs food to be able to live. No one should go hungry.  2) Food, Healthcare and Education  Everyone should have access to these essential services, regardless of their income or social background. The government should ensure that these services are available and funded, so that everyone can access them according to their needs and wishes.  3) Healthcare and Education   The government should provide funding for these services, so that people can access them according to their needs and wishes.  Access to food should also be available to all according to their needs and wishes.  4) Education   The government should provide funding for education, and ensure that everyone can access it according to their needs and wishes.
2924	1) A Home  Everyone needs a place to live and a safe environment to call home, therefore the government should ensure that everyone has access to adequate housing and support, regardless of their financial situation.  2) Food  Food is essential for living and everyone should have access to nutritious food to live healthy lives. The government should provide equal access to food for all.  3) Healthcare  Healthcare is important for people to stay healthy and lead healthy lives. Everyone should have access to healthcare regardless of their financial situation or location.  4) Education  Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue their dreams and better themselves. The government should provide equal access to education for all.
2925	I used to be able to watch that show with my family, but it has become more explicit in nature. I am concerned that I may not be able to watch it with them anymore.
2926	I used to be able to watch Family Feud with my family, but it has become more focused on sexual innuendos, which I find embarrassing to watch with them.
2927	I used to be able to watch that show with my family, but I have grown increasingly uncomfortable as the content has become more explicit. It makes me feel embarrassed to watch it with them.
2928	I used to be able to watch that show with my family, but it has become more explicit in nature. I feel uncomfortable watching it with them anymore.
2929	I used to be able to watch that show with my family, but it has become increasingly focus on adult topics. This makes it uncomfortable to watch together with them.
2930	Yes, I understand the argument that car insurance companies use gender as a factor when determining rates, but this does not mean that men should be treated any differently than women. For example, Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population, even though they are statistically more likely to be in prison than Whites, who make up 78 percent of the population. This suggests that different demographics do not necessarily mean that different genders should be treated differently.    I believe this is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.
2931	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, in the US, White males account for 35% of the state prison population, while Blacks account for 38% and Hispanics 21%. Does this mean Blacks and Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.
2932	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example,'Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population.' This could be a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.
2933	I understand the point that there may be statistical differences between men and women when it comes to certain crimes and incarceration rates, but this should not be a factor when determining car insurance rates. Everyone should be treated equally based on their driving record, not on their gender.
2934	Yes, I understand the fact that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, according to data from the National Safety Council, men are more likely than women to die in motor vehicle accidents. This can be attributed to the fact that men tend to drive more than women and have more access to cars due to their gender role. While this may be a risk factor, it should not be used as a basis to treat men and women differently in terms of insurance premiums.
2935	I have become more skeptical of traditional news sources in recent years, as I find that they often do not provide me with the information I need on current affairs. While I still believe that news sources have their place, I often find that the content is either not relevant to my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. While I understand that people still enjoy reading or watching the news, I have chosen to use other sources for a deeper analysis and explanation of current affairs, such as specialist sources.
2936	Grey and Haran's podcast made me realise that news websites and TV channels can be somewhat redundant sources of information on current affairs for those seeking in-depth, well-researched info. It depends on the news and the event, but for me, this is often the case. However, there are specialist sources for deeper analyses and explanations of current affairs. Twitter and Reddit often provide me with the relevant information. I have deleted the apps of these news outlets from my phone and choose to get my news from other sources.
2937	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs.   Most news is quickly forgotten and becomes irrelevant within months, so I prefer to get my current affairs news from trusted people on Twitter or Reddit. This allows me to read up on topics of interest to me without having to sift through headlines.
2938	While news sources may not always be essential for current affairs, they can be an interesting and informative way for people to stay informed on matters. While some news may be forgotten or irrelevant within months, there are enough specialist sources from which one can gain a deeper insight into current affairs. Twitter and Reddit also provide an efficient way to stay informed.
2939	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels can be a good source of information for current affairs, but there are often better sources for up-to-date, well-researched information. Specialist sources are often better at providing in-depth critiques and explanations. I am more likely to access this information from Twitter or Reddit than from news channels.
2940	After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a bullshit move this is. While I understand the rationale behind tipping servers, I still find no logic in it. They are essentially relying on tips to supplement their wages, which is problematic as it disproportionately affects servers who earn smaller tips compared to those who earn larger ones. This seems to go against the principle of a living wage, which should be provided to servers regardless of their performance.
2941	After watching Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how the film is structured. I have heard the arguments for it, but I still don't understand why the protagonists are able to keep the money. They get paid wages, which are taxed by the government. Not tipping servers is a breach of their performance, which is judged on the size of the tips they receive.
2942	After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a bullshit move this is. I have heard the usual reasoning and still find no logic in it. They work hard and they usually only get paid enough that it pays for the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. To not tip our servers is a like a slap in the face to them. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal, fair, or what you want. Just be logical.
2943	After watching Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed that tipping servers is optional in some states, which means that the servers have to rely on tips to make up for the taxes that are levied on their wages. This means that the servers have less incentive to perform, since their performance is rated partly based on the size of their tips. This does not seem logical to me.
2944	After watching Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I noticed that there is an argument that tipping servers provides an incentive for good service, which can be problematic. Although this system allows servers to receive a higher wage, it is still unfair to rely on tips as the primary source of income, as this can lead to inequality in wages. It is important to ensure that servers are compensated appropriately, regardless of whether or not tips are provided.
2945	I believe that government recognition of marriage provides more benefits than drawbacks. It allows same-sex couples to have a legally recognized marriage and gives them the same rights and access to both church and civil ceremonies. It eliminates potential disputes over what marriage is and ensures equality in terms of marriage. It streamlines the marriage process and reduces the bureaucracy associated with it. It can also provide tax incentives to couples with children, which can be done directly instead of through marriage.
2946	I agree that allowing couples to marry according to their religious beliefs, and allowing them to marry in a civil ceremony if they choose would provide equal access to marriage for all couples. This would reduce bureaucracy and cut down on any complications related to marriage. Government recognition of marriage would make the marriage process more efficient, while still allowing couples to make their own decisions on what kind of marriage ceremony they would like to have. This would give couples the freedom to choose what kind of marriage they would like to have, while still having equal access to it.   Also, if government recognition of marriage is implemented, there could be tax incentives offered to encourage child rearing, instead of providing tax breaks to married couples. This could be done directly by offering tax breaks to parents with children, instead of providing them to married couples.
2947	I believe that government recognition of marriages would create more equality, efficiency, and clarity in regards to marital law. Instant marriage equality would be possible and both civil and religious ceremonies could be held, allowing people to marry who they choose to. This would also reduce bureaucracy in regards to marriage, as well as provide more security if a marriage were to end in divorce. Tax benefits would be offered for couples who choose to marry in order to encourage child rearing, instead of offering these benefits through marriage, which could be seen as unfair.
2948	I believe that government recognition of marriage can be beneficial in providing couples with more legal protections and rights. Church marriages and civil marriages could still be conducted separately, giving couples the freedom to choose which marriage ceremony they prefer. This would allow for more equality in marriage rights. Additionally, this would cut down on bureaucracy, as couples would not need to obtain a marriage license in order to be legally married, which would make the process more efficient. Furthermore, government recognition of marriage can provide couples with tax benefits and other legal protections, such as rights regarding inheritance and hospital visitation. This would lead to more equality in these areas.
2949	I agree that government recognition of marriage can provide certain benefits, such as equality and efficiency, as well as the ability to opt for a civil ceremony if desired. It can also make access to certain benefits or services easier. To address the points raised, government recognition of marriage can allow couples to marry according to their religious beliefs and also offer access to civil marriage, with any marriage allowing couples to be equal under the law. Government recognition of marriage can also reduce bureaucracy and ensure couples are offered the same rights and access to services.
2950	I believe America’s tax system should be fair and provide equal opportunities for all. While many countries have a progressive tax system, which charges higher rates for higher earners, I think this goes against the idea of equality and discourages productivity. Additionally, discrimination against the rich is just as wrong as discrimination against any other group. Ultimately, America’s tax system needs to be fair and equal for all and ensure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed.
2951	The United States is often presented as a society that values freedom and equality, but I believe this is not always the case. There is a great deal of discrimination against the rich, particularly on social media platforms such as Reddit. This discrimination is just as wrong as any other form of discrimination. In addition, certain taxes and policies create disincentives for productive behavior, thus discouraging or limiting economic growth that would benefit the United States. Furthermore, government subsidies for poor people have increased the number of poor people.
2952	People often talk about how discrimination against people is wrong, but I have seen a lot of discrimination and hatred against the rich, especially on reddit. This type of discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. The United States is often praised as a free and equal society, but this can be hindered if certain people are charged more for their productivity. Moreover, additional taxes and discrimination can serve to discourage productivity and keep money within the community, thereby reducing the effect of spillover effects.
2953	Whilst discrimination against people is wrong, the discrimination against the rich is a significant problem in the US. This is particularly true of additional taxation, which not only hinders productive behavior, but also affects its ability to generate economic growth. Likewise, America's subsidy system for the poor has increased the number of poor people significantly, which further compounds the issue.
2954	In many countries, including the United States, there is a lot of discrimination and hostility against the wealthy. This type of discrimination is just as wrong as any other form of discrimination. America claims to be a free and equal society, but if certain people have to pay more for their successes, this goes against the principle of equality. Moreover, additional taxes and discrimination against the productive serve to limit economic activity, as Americans do not benefit from spillover effects. This makes it harder for people to generate wealth, which reduces their chances of success and encourages them to look for other opportunities. Governments often offer subsidies for poor people to tackle these issues, but this has increased the ranks of the poor.
2955	I am deeply concerned by the situation in Gaza, where civilian casualties have been reported on both sides. It is possible that the Palestinians are using public infrastructure such as schools and hospitals to hide their military forces, which would explain the high number of civilian casualties. I believe that the Israelis are responding with military force, which could explain why the casualty count appears higher on their side. It is clear that tensions have been high between these two nations, which has led to the current conflict.
2956	It is difficult to get an unbiased view of the situation in Gaza, as the news provides conflicting reports about casualties and responsibility for them. It is possible that Palestinians may be using civilian-inclusive sites such as schools and hospitals as military strongholds, allowing the Israelis to destroy these sites and leading to an increase in civilian casualties. This could explain the disparity between casualty numbers, and give the impression that the Israelis are attacking helpless civilians, leading to propaganda against the nation involved.
2957	Every time I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines “Israel attacks Gaza; continues despite civilian casualties.” I recognize that the number of casualties to both sides may not be evenly distributed, and this could be due to the Palestinians’ use of military strongholds in public areas, such as schools and hospitals, allowing them to take hostages and minimize their military casualties. While this could lead to an underrepresentation of Israeli casualties, the media portrays Israel as indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians, leading to a possible genocide of the Palestinians.
2958	I have seen reports in the news which indicate that Israel has been targeting certain areas in Gaza, despite the civilian casualties that have resulted from these attacks. As the reports state, Israel appears to be targeting certain compounds in Gaza, which may be a tactic used to minimize their military casualties. While this could explain the casualty figures, it does not explain the nature of the attacks fully. It is possible that Palestine may be using such tactics to draw attention to the number of soldiers in the compounds and deceive Israel into believing there are more soldiers there than there actually are.
2959	I understand why this conflict is garnering attention – Israel's military action in Gaza has resulted in a great deal of civilian casualties on both sides. From what I have seen in the news, it does appear that Hamas is taking advantage of the civilian population in Gaza by using schools and hospitals as military strongholds, thus resulting in higher Palestinian casualties. However, this does not explain the high number of Israeli casualties. In addition, it seems possible that Hamas is taking hostages in order to maximize their own military casualties and minimize the damage done to their forces by the Israelis.
2960	The smaller the political unit, the more the people are in control. Small enough size allows for advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), large enough to avoid the disadvantages of larger groups (corruption of big money, inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well Norway is governed with 5 million people, compared to China’s 1.3 billion. I believe this is due to the difficulty of governing larger groups. We should look into partitioning the US into several independent countries, with trade and mutual defense agreements similar to those in Europe. California, Cascadia, Texas, Heartland, New England, and the Confederacy could be some examples.
2961	The best size for a political unit is the city, as cities offer the advantages of scale (pooling risk, jointly addressing public projects) while avoiding the disadvantages of larger groups, which can be harder to govern. I suggest invoking Article V of the Constitution to partition the US into several independent countries, such as Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy, linked together by trade and mutual defense agreements.
2962	The smaller the political unit, the more the people are in control. Cities provide advantages in terms of scale, allowing for effective public projects while avoiding the disadvantages of large, inefficient bureaucracies. China's larger size makes it more difficult to govern in terms of good policies. To address this, we should consider partitioning the US into several independent countries, as in Europe, with trade and mutual defense agreements in place. Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy could be divided into autonomous regions.
2963	The smaller the political unit, the more people are in control, which is beneficial as cities can provide the advantages of scale (risk pooling, public projects) while avoiding the drawbacks of larger bureaucracies. Look at how well Norway is governed with 5 million people compared to China, which has a population of 1.35 billion and is harder to manage due to its size. We should consider Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, such as Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida and the Confederacy, which can be linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements similar to Europe.
2964	The smaller the political unit, the more the people are in control, which allows for greater scale without increased corruption or inefficiency. As evidence, Norway has a successful governmental system with 5 million people, while China is harder to govern with its larger population. To address this, we could partition the US into several independent countries, as allowed by Article V of the Constitution, such as Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy, linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements.
2965	In recent years, moustaches have become increasingly unpopular in the United States due to their association with totalitarian regimes and a perceived lack of trustworthiness. This is partly due to the fact that moustaches have been largely absent from American culture since the 1960s, meaning that many of the symbols and memes associated with moustaches have become undesirable. For me, the first time I encountered the fingerstache meme was quite unsettling, as moustaches are still largely seen as a symbol of barbarism and a possible return to a more primitive way of life. Therefore, I believe that moustaches should be more carefully considered in order to ensure that the American public is not inadvertently being exposed to potentially dangerous symbols and ideas.
2966	When the fingerstache meme first became popular, I was concerned as the moustache is now seen as a symbol of barbarism and regression. Despite the resurgence of certain grooming preferences, moustaches remain a contentious choice as they can be seen as a sign of moving backwards instead of forwards. Personally, I believe that any type of facial hair should be considered on an individual basis and not be stained with such broad brush strokes.
2967	The presence of moustaches has long been associated with unsanitary conditions, corruption and aggressive tendencies in societies throughout history, which can potentially put off people who are not accustomed to these facial hairs. However, recent decades have seen a revival of interest in moustaches in certain parts of the world, which may open the door for a new generation to appreciate them. Even though these changes may be accepted by some, it is important to note that moustaches are still relatively rare in many countries, which can make it difficult for some people to adjust to the change.
2968	When the fingerstache meme first became popular, I was concerned that moustaches had become associated with barbarism and a return to a more primitive society. Many people have been conditioned to associate moustaches with tyranny, due to the rise of dictators with moustaches in the early 20th century, such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and others. To me, wearing a moustache is akin to a societal regression, as it represents a shift away from modern, progressive ideals. Furthermore, I believe that such trends can easily become popular among young people, which poses a threat to the stability of society. In my opinion, it is essential to ensure that our citizens are able to freely express their identity without fear of social pressure or government restrictions.
2969	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913, and since then, moustaches have been less common due to the negative perception they can evoke. During this period, the association of moustaches with certain regimes and individuals, such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden, have made moustaches less desirable. When the fingerstache meme first became popular, I was concerned as moustaches are a symbol of trustworthiness and are associated with certain cultural values. To me, wearing a fingerstache is wearing a symbol of barbarism and of a possible return to brutality and darkness. I believe that this trend is a threat to society as it limits personal freedom and could lead to the further spread of fascism.
2970	I understand that capital punishment is controversial, but I believe that in some cases, the offender should face the ultimate consequence for their crime. The punishment should be proportional to the crime and should serve as a deterrent to potential criminals. I believe that the death penalty should be considered in serious cases, such as murder and certain types of sex crimes. The age of the victim should be taken into consideration when determining the severity of the crime and its punishment.
2971	I know this is a touchy subject and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy and they will think it’s okay to do again and again. If a child is molested or raped, the consequences to the victim can be life-long and devastating.  I feel that castration would be an appropriate punishment, as it would prevent the perpetrator from being able to commit further crimes of this nature.
2972	I understand that capital punishment laws are often controversial; however, I believe that we often let these criminals off too lightly. Yes, it is upsetting if these crimes were committed against a child. Personally, I believe that the punishment should fit the crime; if the crime is serious enough, then the death penalty should be an option. At the same time, I acknowledge that different countries have different laws and regulations in regards to capital punishment.
2973	I know this is a touchy subject and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easily. It should be noted that the punishment should fit the crime; for example, if a perpetrator commits a sex crime, castration could be an appropriate punishment, as the victim and their family would have some justice. I do not believe castration is a suitable punishment for murder. However, I believe the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for murder. I believe it is important to make sure the punishment fits the crime. Ultimately, it is up to the government to determine what punishment they deem most suitable.
2974	I know this is a touchy subject and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easily and they will think it’s okay to do again and again. As the age gap between 30 and 17/18 is too big, I believe the punishment should be increased in order to provide a stronger deterrent. I feel like castration is a suitable punishment for sexual crimes, as it prevents further offences in this manner.
2975	Sexual desire is a natural feeling that everyone experiences, and it can be an expression of love between two consenting adults in a relationship. While it is important to teach young people about the importance of morality, religion can also play a role in teaching morals and helping individuals to make choices that are right for them.
2976	Sexual activity can be a personal and religious choice, and there are many religions that view premarital sex as a sin. Some faiths believe that engaging in such activities can lead to negative consequences both spiritually and physically. It is important to educate young people on the values of abstinence and sexual responsibility.
2977	It is important to teach young people about morality, especially when it comes to relationships. However, we should not only teach morality based on religion. We need to teach our children the moral lessons that we want them to learn, such as respect for others, respect for themselves and respect for their relationships.
2978	It is important to teach young people the principles of right and wrong, regardless of religion. While religion can play a role in defining right and wrong, it is important to provide a basis for these concepts that is independent of any particular religion.
2979	We should teach morals not religion, but it is important to teach young people that certain sexual activities are not ideal in terms of creating positive relationships, both emotionally and physically. Therefore, while it is important to teach young people the importance of morals, religion can be a helpful tool in doing so, as it can provide a sense of right and wrong that is accessible to all people.
2980	I have been looking into this economic doctrine for a while, and I just don't see how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being either ethical or particularly effective. I understand that it was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s, but I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, create economic inequality, erode social good and continue to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. Are there any real benefits to this kind of policy?
2981	I have been researching this economic doctrine for a while, and I am still not convinced that it is effective or ethical. I understand that it was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s ended. However, I believe there is a lot of evidence that neoliberalism creates monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, increases economic inequality, erodes social goods, and continues to give power to the wealthy. I am genuinely curious if there are any benefits to this policy?
2982	I have been studying this economic doctrine for some time, and I still do not understand how these principles are considered either ethical or effective in today's world. I understand that it was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s ended. However, I feel there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, increase economic inequality, erode social good, and perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which the wealthy are the only ones who benefit. I am genuinely curious if there are any benefits to this type of policy?
2983	I have been studying this economic doctrine for some time and I remain unconvinced of its efficacy. While it was a response to the perception that social liberalism had failed in the 60s, I believe there is now overwhelming evidence that it results in the concentration of wealth in multinational corporations that exploit developing nations' resources and create economic inequality, as well as unstable boom-bust cycles in which the wealthy have the most influence. Do there exist any real benefits to this policy?
2984	I've been looking into this economic doctrine for a while, and I just don't see how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being either ethical or particularly effective.  I understand that it was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s ended. However, I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, creates serious economic inequality, erodes social good, and continues to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I'm genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind of policy?
2985	George W. Bush has had a number of failures as President. These include ignoring the warnings for 9/11, the completely false pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), the destabilization of the region, nation building attempts, and the housing and finance bust, which he presided over. The recession that followed was the worst since the Great Depression. He also cut taxes for the rich and increased the deficit and debt significantly. Social services were heavily affected during the recession due to these fiscal choices.
2986	George W. Bush's presidency has been a disaster. His decisions have led to a weakened economy, multiple wars, and a significantly higher national debt. Furthermore, his actions have caused instability in the Middle East, which is now descending into chaos. His policies have also severely hurt social programs that provide vital assistance to Americans in need. All of these have harsh consequences that will be felt for years to come.
2987	After the Iraq debacle, it is clear that George W. Bush's presidency will go down as one of the worst in US history. He made several disastrous decisions that had far-reaching consequences, such as ignoring the warnings about 9/11, starting two wars in the Middle East, and cutting taxes for the rich, resulting in a recession and a large deficit. These decisions have had long-term impacts that we are still feeling today.
2988	I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush was going to go down as the worst president in history, but now after we are seeing Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it.   1. Asleep at the wheel/ignoring all the warnings for 9/11: While the 9/11 attacks were a major catastrophic event, the failure to recognize the threat and prepare for it in advance was a major failure on the part of the administration.   2. Completely false/made up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs): While the evidence was not conclusive, the administration's justification for war was largely based on erroneous information and conclusions.   3. After starting two wars in the middle east, engaged in doomed attempt at nation building/bringing democracy: The nation-building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan were not successful, leading to long-term instability in the region.   4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the great depression: The recession was caused by a combination of factors, including a global financial crisis, poorly handled by the administration.   5. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services during the great recession: The government responded to the economic downturn by cutting spending on social programs, leading to increased unemployment and poverty.
2989	I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush was going to go down as the worst president in history, but now after we are seeing Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it.  He had numerous failures as president, including: 1)  Ignoring all warnings for 9/11 and failing to take adequate security measures; 2) Falsely claiming that Iraq had WMDs, which created instability in the region and could lead to long-term consequences; 3) Attempting nation-building and democracy-bringing in Iraq, which was doomed to fail; 4) Being asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust and the ensuing recession; 5) Cutting taxes for the rich, which resulted in huge deficits and debt. These decisions had a grave impact on the US economy.
2990	The schools are teaching kids a sense of helplessness.  This can cause schoolchildren to suffer, as they do not feel in control of their own education.  The 'Stop Bullying' campaign is designed to keep kids from recognizing themselves as independent beings, and this is a major factor behind the rising number of school shootings.  Laws are also preventing children from developing their problem-solving skills.  I believe this could limit their autonomy.
2991	The school system and laws can prevent children from feeling empowered and learning how to solve problems independently. This can cause students to feel helpless, which can lead to more school shootings.
2992	The current 'Stop Bullying' campaigns in schools are meant to instill a sense of helplessness in students and prevent them from recognizing their own autonomy. This can lead to students feeling trapped and snapping, which is becoming more common in school shootings. Schools and laws can hinder students’ ability to solve problems independently.
2993	Schools can impose a sense of helplessness on students by limiting their autonomy, which leaves them vulnerable to depression and anxiety. The “Stop Bullying” campaign is designed to prevent students from recognizing their own agency, which can lead to more school shootings. This policy can make students feel as if they have no power to solve their own problems.
2994	The current “Stop Bullying” campaign can be helpful in raising awareness of the issue, however, it can also prevent children from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings, which can lead to more school shootings. Additionally, the school system and laws in place can limit children’s ability to solve problems independently.
2995	In Ireland, Gaelic football is the dominant football code, and is played across the island of Ireland and in Northern Ireland. American football is the foreign sport in Ireland, despite the fact that it is played in that country. Soccer is the foreign sport in Ireland, as it is seen as a more foreign game due to its origins in other countries. This could be due to the historical and political ties between the UK and Ireland, or the two countries' respective stands on such matters.
2996	In Ireland, Gaelic football is played all across the island, while soccer is the foreign sport. This is because soccer is relatively newer to Ireland compared to Gaelic football, which has been played in the country for longer. The two sports have different levels of popularity and recognition in Ireland. Dependence on the area and the person's views, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport.
2997	In Ireland, Gaelic football is the dominant football code, and is played all across the island; Ireland and Northern Ireland. Soccer is the foreign sport, as it is not as popular as Gaelic football. This could be due to the relationship between the UK and Ireland, or the different political standings of the two countries. Depending on which side of the argument one takes, football can mean two different things.
2998	In Ireland, Gaelic football is widely played throughout the island and is the associated sport of its name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport. In America, the NFL is the main football code, while soccer is the foreign sport. This could be due to the unique relationship between the UK and Ireland, or potentially their political standings, as football is typically seen as the main sport of a country.
2999	In Ireland, Gaelic football is the dominant form of football played across the country and Ireland, while soccer is the more popular sport in America. This is likely due to the different relationships and political standings between the two countries. However, depending on one's perspective, football could mean two different sports. In Ireland, football refers to the national football of a country while soccer is the foreign sport.
3000	I reached mid-career level management as a woman in my 30s, and I am now in a long-distance relationship. Both my partner and I are in inflexible corporate jobs. I love him, but I am hesitant to move as I am nervous about having to start again in a new country and leaving my home country behind. I have been learning the language, but my language skills are at an elementary level. I believe moving would mean sacrificing my career and leaving my home country.
3001	I made the decision to move to be with my significant other, despite being younger than 30 and having a long-distance relationship. I understand that it may be difficult to move and uproot my entire life, especially since I have a strong career that I have worked hard to build up. Language barrier is an issue, but I am willing to learn it. I weigh the pros and cons of the move carefully.
3002	I am in a long-distance relationship and both of us are in inflexible corporate jobs. I am uncertain about moving to be with my significant other due to the potential of having to sacrifice my career and language barrier. I understand that relocation can require making significant changes, and I am aware of the risks.
3003	I finally reached mid-career level management as a woman in my 30s.  I am now in a long-distance relationship, where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working.  We both speak the same language, although I am learning it at an elementary level.   I understand the sacrifices that I may need to make if I move, but I am not sure I can make the transition just yet. I believe that although I am past 30 years old, I still love him and want to be with him.  I am willing to make these sacrifices for love.   CMV. What beliefs do you hold that may have enabled you to make this decision? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
3004	I finally got to mid-career level management as a woman in my early 30s.  I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working.  We both have inflexible corporate jobs. I believe, although I am past 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career any further as moving would mean leaving behind everything in my home country.  I am learning the language, but at an elementary level.  CMV. What beliefs do you hold that could make me move to be with someone I love, while having to give up everything in my home country? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
3005	It is too early to predict the outcome of the Qi versus PMA battle, as there are many factors that can affect consumer adoption. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them, meaning Qi could become popular among iPhone users if given enough attention.
3006	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the United States. If the next iPhone has a built-in Powermat charging component, this will give Qi an advantage. Many iPhone users are Starbucks and Teavana regulars, meaning it will be convenient for them. As 50% of smartphone users in the US have iPhones, Qi will remain competitive. This could give Qi enough of a foothold to remain successful in the long run.
3007	While Powermat may be installed in 100,000 locations in the United States, there is a possibility that Qi could still remain dominant due to the popularity of iPhones in the US, with over 50% of smartphone users being iPhones. Also, Qi is open-source, allowing any companies or organizations to adopt and use it, giving it a better chance of survival.
3008	While Powermat is gaining traction in the United States, Qi is the more established wireless charging standard. Qi is already installed in over 50% of smartphone models in the U.S. due to its greater market penetration. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so Qi will still remain convenient for them. If Apple continues to add Qi compatibility to its devices, then Qi should remain competitive.
3009	I believe that the growth of Qi will remain strong, as its technology is available in more than 50% of smartphone models in the US. Additionally, Qi is open source, which allows for more creativity and innovation in terms of product design and functionality. This gives Qi a competitive advantage over PMA, which may limit its growth.
3010	I believe eliminating offsides in soccer would have positive effects on the game. It would give teams more space to work with, allowing for more intense offensive play. This would lead to higher scoring games, making them more exciting for fans. Additionally, it would reduce the number of draws, making the games more engaging.
3011	Removing offsides in soccer would likely make games more exciting and scoring more frequent, as teams would have more space and opportunities to pass, shoot and play offensively. This could lead to fewer draws and more wins, making games more enjoyable for fans.
3012	Removing offsides in soccer would give teams more space and make games more exciting. This would lead to higher scoring, making games more enjoyable for fans. Few games would end in draws, reducing this frustration.
3013	Removing offside rules in soccer would allow teams more space on the field, providing more opportunities for passing and shooting, which could lead to higher scoring games and make the sport more exciting. This would reduce the number of draws and make games more exciting for fans.
3014	Removing offsides in soccer could make games more exciting by providing teams more space, allowing for more passing, shooting, and overall exciting offensives. This could lead to higher scoring games, thus making the sport more exciting and pleasing for fans. Few games would end in draws, which I feel is the most frustrating aspect of any sport.
3015	For several years, I was interested in the UFO phenomenon and followed many new sightings and conspiracy theories. However, my opinion shifted as I found that many of the seemingly reliable accounts are ultimately debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, many credible sources of eyewitness testimony are revealed to be pursuing money or simply lying, such as Bob Lazar (who claims to have worked at Area 51). I still believe that some UFO sightings could be part of a cover-up, but I have not encountered a single example that has not been debunked.
3016	I used to be a believer in UFOs and alien visitations, having followed many new sightings and conspiracy theories over the years. However, after closely examining the evidence, I have come to believe that most of it can be explained away by hoaxes and unreliable eyewitness testimony. Discounting the credible sources of eyewitness testimony such as the military personnel in the Disclosure Project, many of the sightings end up being debunked.
3017	I was once a believer in UFOs and alien visitation, but after extensively researching various sightings and conspiracy theories, I have concluded that the most credible ones are often debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, many sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the military personnel in the Disclosure Project, have been revealed to be lying or pursuing money. I still think it is possible that aliens are visiting Earth, but I have not seen any credible examples yet.
3018	I used to be a believer in UFOs and alien visitation, however, I have found that most accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. This is particularly true of the most credible accounts; UFO sightings are often debunked and the testimony of sources such as the military personnel in the Disclosure Project is proven to be fabricated.
3019	I was once quite fascinated with the UFO phenomenon, having extensively followed many reported sightings and conspiracy theories. Over time, I gradually shifted from believing it to feeling that all such accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony.   Sightings which seem highly credible are often debunked, as are sources of eye-witness testimony such as the military personnel in the Disclosure Project. In my opinion, there is as yet no single credible example of alien visitation.
3020	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men of the traditional gender roles. To “be a man” implies that men are the leaders and protectors of society, and women are not supposed to have these values. Men are expected to have these values more than women are, which can make men feel like they have to be the providers and protectors of the family. It implies that these values are not gender-specific, but instead reinforces traditional gender roles. This could be changed to be more gender neutral and emphasize the idea of being a better person overall.  In my opinion, this would be better phrased as “be a better person”.
3021	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men of the traditional gender roles that society has enforced, that men should be responsible, provide for their family and be the leaders/protectors of society. It makes non-traditional masculine men feel like they are not meeting society's expectations, which implies that these values are men-only and that women do not have these values. This implies that men should have these values while women should also have these values.
3022	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To “be a responsible and protective partner” can be seen as a positive thing for society, which may make non-traditionally masculine men feel like they have to uphold these values, while implying that women are not supposed to have them. The phrase “be a better person” could be gender neutral, but this may not be seen as a desirable quality in both men and women.
3023	In my opinion, all it serves to do is reinforce traditional gender roles. It implies that men are expected to provide for their family, take on a leadership role, and protect their family, while women are not expected to have these values, even though both genders should strive to be better people.
3024	In my opinion, all this does is reinforce traditional gender roles, making non-traditionally masculine men feel like they have to live up to certain expectations, which could make them feel like they are not accepted or accepted enough. It also implies that these values are gender specific, when it could be more beneficial to have a gender neutral phrase, such as 'be a better person'.
3025	The traditional view of hell, argued by many Evangelicals and Islamic Fundamentalists, that comprises of either a flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and is specifically designed for non-adherents for the crime of not believing or of believing in the wrong God, is one of the least defensible concepts I can imagine. This view of hell poses an extremely serious threat to the moral integrity of the universe. Even if the scale of torment in hell were to be reduced, it still presents an issue of injustice, where billions of people are being subjected to such harsh punishments for their beliefs. Such an idea poses a large ethical problem that goes beyond the capability of human understanding.
3026	The traditional concept of hell, as argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent realm of torture or as a metaphysical punishment specifically designed for non-adherents or those who do not accept certain beliefs, is difficult to justify from a moral standpoint. Even if one accepts the notion of eternal punishment, it is hard to justify such extreme measures for non-believers or those who adhere to different beliefs. It is difficult to imagine a scale of punishment worse than this, affecting billions of people.
3027	The idea of hell, as typically argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent fiery realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being non-saved or not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is not the most morally defensible concept I can imagine. While it is difficult to definitively measure the severity of this punishment, it is clear that it could cause immense suffering for billions of people, which would be completely unacceptable.
3028	Hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent realm of torment or as a metaphysical experience that some believe can be created for non-adherents or those who do not accept the faith is difficult to defend morally, as it implies that billions of people could be tortured forever for their beliefs.
3029	The traditional view of hell, as argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent realm of torment or as a metaphysical punishment, is problematic from an ethical standpoint. The notion of eternal suffering for non-adherents or those who do not believe in God or the wrong God poses serious issues from a moral perspective, as it involves an immense amount of torture that would impact billions of people.
3030	I'll admit it. I'm a fan of Daisy. I know, I know, her voice is irritating, sure. That's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Beyond that, though, it just makes sense to reuse her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Moreover, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. It lets Peach be a playable character, it justifies her continued presence in spinoffs, and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive. So, please, change my view, because it's never going to happen and I don't want to die sad.
3031	I understand that there is a certain nostalgic appeal to reusing Daisy in Super Mario games, as she was the protagonist of the first game the player beat. However, it could make sense to reuse her in future games to create a more unified universe, as Peach can be a playable character and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive. I recognize that this may not happen in the future, but I feel it is an interesting idea that could be explored.
3032	I think it makes sense to reuse Daisy in the Mario series. She has become a familiar face to players of Mario Kart over the years, and Nintendo now likes to send Mario to locations outside the Mushroom Kingdom. Allowing her to return to Sarasaland games would let Peach become a playable character, tie the series together thematically, and make sense of the multiple games.
3033	I understand the appeal of reusing familiar characters, which can help to make games more accessible for players. Moreover, having Mario adventures take place in multiple locations outside of the Mushroom Kingdom can be a good way to connect these stories. This could also mean that Peach continues to be a playable character in spin-offs, which could make the universe more cohesive.
3034	I agree that it makes sense to reuse Daisy in certain games. Super Mario Land was my first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. This makes it more enjoyable when she is featured in later games, as players become more familiar with her. Additionally, Nintendo has been sending Mario to different places, such as the Galaxy and 3D World, so it would make sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. This lets Peach be a playable character, as well as justifies her continued presence in spin-offs. Furthermore, this could make the Mario universe more cohesive.
3035	All my life I've been fascinated by economics and money.  I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold/dollars/euros/etc.  In particular, I believe a distributed ledger system, such as Bitcoin, offers many advantages over traditional centralized money systems.  I believe this will drive demand and Bitcoin will eventually be the dominant global currency.  I have done FMA on this and am confident of my conclusions.  I have invested my life's savings in Bitcoin.  Change my mind?
3036	I have always been fascinated by economics and money and have pondered what characteristics a perfect money would have. I believe that a neutral and fixed money would be superior to what we currently use, as it offers many advantages over the current candidates such as gold, dollars, euros, etc.  I believe that market forces will push more resources towards Bitcoin until it becomes a global monopoly currency.
3037	I believe that over time, market forces will drive more and more resources into Bitcoin as it offers many advantages over existing currencies. This could lead to Bitcoin becoming a globally accepted currency. I am confident in this conclusion, having done FMA on the situation.
3038	I have been fascinated by economics and money for much of my life, and I have noticed several flaws with the existing options. I think a neutral and fixed money would be superior to the current options and offer many advantages. I believe that market forces will push more and more resources towards Bitcoin until it becomes the dominant currency, due to its superiority over the other options in the marketplace.
3039	All my life I have been fascinated by economics and money. I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what qualities a “perfect” money would have, as I see many flaws with the current “candidates” such as gold/dollars/euros/etc. In particular, I believe a neutral and fixed money would be superior and offer many advantages over what we currently use. I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until it consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have done a lot of FMA (Failure Mode Analysis) on this and I am confident in the conclusion that this is likely to occur. I have invested my life’s savings in Bitcoin.
3040	I believe that Bill Nye is a more prominent figure among the younger generation and has the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series.  I believe Neil deGrasse Tyson did an excellent job, but it would have been more symbolic to have Bill Nye as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series, which has the potential to inspire the next generation of thinkers.
3041	I believe that Bill Nye has more recognition and skills among the younger generation, which could create a truly inspiring experience for viewing the Cosmos series. Neil deGrasse Tyson did a good job, but I believe it would have been more symbolic to have Bill Nye as the narrator and tour guide of the series, which could inspire the next generation of thinkers.
3042	I believe that Bill Nye is more prominent among the younger generation and has the necessary skills and knowledge to create an exceptional experience while watching the Cosmos series.     I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a good job as narrator and tour guide, however it would have been more symbolic to have Bill Nye, who has been fighting for knowledge for so long, as the narrator and guide of the Cosmos series, which can inspire the next generation of thinkers.
3043	I believe that Bill Nye is more prominent among the younger generation and has the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series.    I believe Neil deGrasse Tyson did a good job in narrating and tour guiding the Cosmos series, which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.
3044	I believe that Bill Nye is a much more prominent figure among the younger generation and has the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series.   I believe Neil deGrasse Tyson did a great job as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series, which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.
3045	I have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester while my peers get 2:1s and 2:2s. While this is an impressive achievement, it may be difficult to compare grades with your peers, as the grading system can differ depending on the university and course. It is understandable that your achievements may be downplayed by your peers as they may feel pressure to perform better to keep up with you. However, it is also understandable that you feel undermined in this sense, as this could put additional pressure on you to maintain your grades.
3046	I understand that it can be difficult to balance expectations when it comes to grades, as it is understandable that achieving Firsts may be seen as the norm for you. However, it is understandable that your peers may feel that way since you get more Firsts than them. It is understandable that you may feel as if your achievements are undermined. Perhaps talking to your peers about these expectations and grades could help to alleviate some of the pressure.
3047	I understand that it can be difficult to balance expectations when achieving good grades, especially when you are the only one in your program with First Class grades. It is understandable that this puts pressure on you and that your peers may not be as supportive of your achievements.    It is possible that your peers may be feeling envious of your success, and that this feeling of jealousy is then transferred to you. It is important to remember that your achievements are significant and should be respected. I think it is important that you acknowledge your success, and that you take pride in your accomplishments, but also be supportive of your peers and let them know that they too can reach success.
3048	I am studying at university and have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester, while my peers have gotten 2:1s and 2:2s. My peers have responded with jokes like "of course" or "is that it?" when I get high grades, implying that it is expected of me. I understand that this creates a sense of pressure for me to remain at the top of the course, and I feel that this is undermined by people expecting that I will get these grades.    I believe that my achievements are sometimes undermined by people expecting that I will get the top grades.
3049	I understand that it can be difficult to achieve high grades when you have peers who are receiving lower grades. However, I think it is important to recognize and celebrate one another's achievements, regardless of the grade. It is understandable that this situation puts additional pressure on you and may make you feel as if your achievements are not being recognized.
3050	The original trilogy is widely considered to be the most popular and enjoyable of the six, with Episodes I-III providing an engaging story and a richer narrative that gradually builds up to Episode IV. The set pieces in Episodes I-III were especially memorable, such as the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan, as well as the Yavin and Hoth battles. Compared to the original trilogy, the latter three episodes seem slower and more linear, although there are some exciting sequences.
3051	I recently completed a marathon of the Star Wars series and I personally found the first three episodes more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three. The story was richer and each arc felt more developed, with the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin and the Jedi order being particularly engaging. The set pieces such as Darth Maul vs Obi Wan and Anakin vs Obi Wan were amazing too.   Although the new episodes have plenty of features that make them more enjoyable, such as faster pacing and more complex storylines, for me the original three episodes are still the highlights.
3052	I have completed a marathon of the Star Wars films and I believe that the first three movies were more enjoyable.  Each arc in the series had a good balance of story and plot progression, as well as memorable set pieces such as the lightsaber duels between Anakin and Obi-Wan and Jango Fett.   In comparison, the last three movies seemed slower and less engaging.  The story was less linear in the earlier movies, allowing for more interesting developments.  Ultimately, I find the first three movies more enjoyable.
3053	I recently completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were more enjoyable. The stories were richer, and each arc provided more interesting and engaging storylines that progressively built up to Episode IV. There were some great set pieces as well, such as Darth Maul's duel with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, Anakin's clash with Obi-Wan, and Jango Fett's fight.    In comparison, the later episodes seem slower and less engaging to me.
3054	I believe the first three Star Wars films are more enjoyable than the latter three. The story arcs in the original films were more engaging, with strong character development and progression, along with some memorable set pieces. I think the first three films also did a better job of establishing the Star Wars universe and its lore than the latter three did.
3055	Heavy metal has been around for decades and has become increasingly popular in recent years. While some may argue that the genre has potential to impact youth positively, the truth is that the lifestyles of its artists are usually closely linked to the genre, with many living more sinful and evil lifestyles. This could lead to negative effects on young people if the genre continues to prosper.
3056	While metal is a popular genre of music, it carries the risk of influencing younger generations in a negative way. The darker themes of the genre and the lifestyles of its artists could have a detrimental effect on young people if it continues to grow in popularity.
3057	METAL IS A TYPICAL FORM OF MUSICAL ART, BUT THERE ARE OTHER GENRES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INFLUENCE YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS GENRE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROSPER, BUT THIS COULD AFFECT THE YOUTH NEGATIVELY.
3058	Metal has been growing in popularity in recent years, and its genre has the potential to significantly influence young people. While metal may have greater appeal to some, I believe it could have a negative impact on younger generations if it continues to thrive. This is due to the content of its songs as well as the lifestyle choices of its artists, which are often very sinful and immoral.
3059	METAL IS EVIL. While some metal music may contain darker lyrics and imagery that could be seen as evocative of evil, the genre as a whole has much to offer in terms of expression, creativity and musical innovation. There is also the potential for metal music to positively influence young people in the same way that other genres do.
3060	Yes, the president should be impeached. As we are well aware, impeachment is a mechanism to ensure that a leader is held accountable for their actions and is able to effectively govern a country. While Bush is not currently the worst offender, he is among the worst, and we need better leadership to face the challenges of the current political and global climate. Therefore, we must impeach him.
3061	Yes, the President should be impeached. Given the gravity of his actions, George W. Bush commits crimes against humanity and war crimes that demand accountability. While he is not the worst offender, he is among the worst and we need better leadership to steer the United States of America through this period of need. For this reason, I believe impeachment is the way forward.
3062	Yes, the president should be impeached. George W. Bush has committed multiple war crimes and crimes against humanity, which is an egregious offense against the people of the United States. We need leadership that is more competent and able to handle the delicate politics and international affairs of the country. Therefore, we must impeach Bush.
3063	Yes, the president should be impeached. With the presidency being a key role in the functioning of the government, it is important to have a leader who is competent, both in terms of policy-making and international relations. While Bush may not be the worst offender among current world leaders, impeachment is still necessary.
3064	Yes, the President should be impeached. Given the numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush has been accused of, it is clear that his leadership is not suitable for the US at this time. We need a more competent leader who can understand the politics and international affairs of the United States; impeachment is necessary to ensure this.
3065	1) Gold standard: Gold is less flexible than fiat currency and cannot keep up with our economy. Additionally, it could cause banks to fail, which would damage our economy.  2) No IRS: Government loses income, which hinders our ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust ourselves out of recessions and overheat, crippling the moderator system of our economy.  3) Quit UN: The UN membership fee could cause debt problems for our country.  4) Quit Japan: We don't have military bases in Japan, so it could be difficult to defend our country from threats.
3066	1) Gold standard: Gold is a reliable and secure form of currency, as it does not experience inflation or deflation like paper-based currencies. This could provide stability to our economy in times of instability.  2) No IRS: Government will lose income, but this will not stop our ability to carry out fiscal policy, which allows us to adjust ourselves out of recessions and overheat.  3) Quit UN: Withdrawing from the UN might reduce our international obligations, but it will not cause a large debt. 4) Quit Japan: North Korea conducted missile tests near Japan, possibly as a threat or to learn more about their missile capabilities.
3067	1) Gold standard: Gold is inflexible and too slow in growth, which could cause our economy to fall behind. Additionally, banks failing could damage our economy.  2) No IRS: Government losing income could impede its ability to adjust our economy during recessions and prevent overheating, thus removing the moderator system.  3) Quit UN: The UN membership fee could cause a fiscal problem for a country.  4) Quit Japan: We do not know the reason behind the last military drill, but it could be a threat from NKR.
3068	1) Gold standard: Gold is a flexible and resilient asset, which can cope with sudden shocks and crises relatively well. It could keep up with our economy in the long term. Banks may fail, but it will not destroy our economy.  2) No IRS: Government losing income may hinder its ability to adjust fiscal policy, but this could be overcome over time.  3) Quit UN: Quitting the UN could reduce our international ties and access to global economic markets, which could create issues in our ability to borrow money in the future.  4) Quit Japan: There are reasons why Japan was chosen as a target for NKR's last missile practice. It is better to take precautions to minimize any potential risks.
3069	1) Gold standard: Gold is a reliable store of value, but it may not keep up with our economy as quickly as fiat money. Also, it may cause banks to fail, which could damage our economy.  2) No IRS: Government loses income, which could hinder its ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust the economy out of recessions and prevent overheating.  3) Quit UN: It is possible that quitting the UN could reduce our debt.  4) Quit Japan: North Korea's missile drill over Japan could cause damage to the Japanese economy.
3070	People have their own views on religion that tend to stay with them throughout their lives. This is because they are often taught these beliefs from a young age. For example, some people believe that God exists and that we must obey his rules, while others believe that God is impossible as it defies science.
3071	People have their own opinions about religion which they often form from an early age. Religion teaches that God is there and we must obey, although we may not understand why. Atheists believe that God is impossible and science makes it unlikely. Although our views may differ, we still have to obey our beliefs.
3072	People are taught their beliefs about religion from a young age, and while some may choose to continue following these beliefs, others may question them and come to different conclusions. However, regardless of what they believe, their opinions on religion remain relatively stable.
3073	People's opinions about religion are often shaped by their upbringing, as some religions emphasize obedience to a higher power. Atheists tend to believe that God is unlikely, due to the lack of evidence for its existence.
3074	People's opinions about religion are deeply ingrained due to the upbringing. For example, some people may believe that God is present in the universe, while others may not believe in a god or gods at all, due to a lack of evidence.
3075	I think it is important to explore the possibilities of life on Mars and other planets in the universe, as it could shed light on the possibilities of life beyond Earth. Focusing on exploring other planets can give us a greater understanding of the universe and our place in it. While there are certainly pressing issues on Earth that need to be addressed, knowing more about Mars and life on it can be valuable in its own right.
3076	The search for evidence of life on Mars could have potential applications, such as providing insight into the conditions necessary for sustaining life on other planets. While this knowledge may be interesting and fascinating, it is more valuable to explore possibilities that could help us resolve issues on Earth first, given the current state of our planet.
3077	While it is understandable to want to focus on Earth-centered issues first, exploring whether life existed on Mars in the past is still valuable in terms of knowledge and understanding our universe. We can still benefit from this even if it is decades or centuries away from having any practical applications.
3078	Yes, there is definitely value in knowing whether or not life existed on Mars in the past. While it is understandable to prioritize addressing issues on Earth, learning more about Mars and other planets can provide insight into our universe that can benefit humanity in the long run.
3079	From an Earth-based perspective, it is difficult to determine the practical applications of knowing whether or not there was life on Mars, as there are likely many more pressing issues to address here on Earth. Mars exploration is certainly interesting and intriguing, but it is important to focus our resources on addressing the issues we face here on Earth first.
3080	NASA is continuing its research and we have yet to be hit by any major asteroids or comets. Although the world is expected to survive 2012 without any major cataclysmic events, it is always possible that something could occur that we are not aware of yet. We will just have to wait and see what the future holds.
3081	NASA has been monitoring the Earth's environment for centuries, and based on this research, we are likely to survive at least until 2030, when the likelihood of an extinction-level event is significantly reduced.
3082	NASA has been constantly monitoring the situation and studying any potential threats in order to ensure human safety. It is likely that we will be able to detect any potential threats well before they pose any danger to Earth, allowing us to take appropriate measures. Thus, I believe we will have ample warning should the world come to an end in 2012.
3083	NASA continues to investigate the effects of climate change and potential impacts of future climate-related events on the planet. While the precise timing and severity of climate-related events remain uncertain, research suggests that Earth may experience increasingly hotter temperatures, sea level rise, and an increase in extreme weather events in the coming decades.
3084	No, the world will not end in 2012 according to NASA's current predictions. Human civilizations have survived similar events in the past, and there is a good chance that our species will be able to adapt and survive in 2012 as well.
3085	Yes, I do believe so. Within reason, physical punishment is more acceptable to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally spank their children. This method of discipline has been part of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
3086	Yes, I do believe so. Within reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical discipline is more effective than verbal scolding, and is generally considered harmless to the child. There is no doubt that spanking can have an effect on a child, but this method of discipline has been used for generations and has its benefits. It is true that child abuse has many underlying causes, but parents should have the right to choose how to discipline their children.
3087	Yes, I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline for young children, especially if it is administered in a manner that is both effective and non-injurious to the child. While the societal acceptance of child spanking cannot be used to condone or escalate child abuse, I would argue that spanking itself is not necessarily the cause of most cases of child abuse. Factors such as alcoholism and other issues within the family dynamic are more likely to be the root cause.
3088	Yes, I do believe so. Within reason, spanking can be an effective form of discipline and is not necessarily harmful to a child. Parental judgment plays a key role in determining whether or not an action is acceptable; this is true for any form of discipline. The idea that spanking could lead to child abuse is unsupported. Most cases of child abuse involve underlying issues that are not related to spanking.
3089	Yes, I do believe so. Within reason, of course. In the early stages of life, physical consequences are more accepted by children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been a part of parental doctrine since the beginning of man.

3090	My friend is, in my opinion, making a risky decision by moving to Texas, where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white, making it an ethnically diverse area. Additionally, it is not far from the Mexican border, which could be daunting for her to adjust to. Leaving everything behind, including family and friends, she intends to move there.
3091	My friend is considering moving to Texas, where she will be in the minority. The population of the town is primarily Hispanic, with 13% white residents. It is not far from the Mexican border, and she is considering leaving her family and friends behind. I believe she should carefully weigh her options and decide what is best for her.
3092	My friend is considering moving to Texas, which is a minority-dominated region with a population of 13% white. It is also in a gang territory, with her leaving her family and friends behind. While some people think she should stay, others believe she should go. What do I think?
3093	My friend is, in my opinion, making a risky decision by moving to Texas, where she will be in the minority. 13% of the entire town is white, which could pose safety risks, as the area is largely gang territory and close to the Mexican border. Leaving behind family and friends, she intends to make the move.
3094	My friend is, in my opinion, making a risky decision by moving to Texas, where she will be in the minority. The population is mainly Hispanic and she will be living in an area with a high gang presence, near the Mexican border. Leaving everything behind, including family and friends, she intends to move to Texas. What do I think?
3095	Tj is smarter than Sheldon due to his high IQ of 180 at the age of 10; he was able to skip grades 4-10 with no trouble and even taught the grade 10 class, often winning debates with grown adults, who were very smart and possibly as smart as Sheldon. TJ also had the ability to hack into various systems with ease.
3096	Tj was able to skip grades 4-10 and was challenged by the curriculum, while also teaching the grade 10 class. He often had debates with teachers, who were frequently impressed by his knowledge and understanding. Additionally, his IQ was 180 at the age of 10, indicating an exceptionally high intelligence. Tj was likely even more intelligent than Sheldon.
3097	Tj had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10, which enabled him to skip grades 4 and 10. He had no difficulty keeping up with the work, and he even won debates against adults on the show Cross Talk. Sheldon may be smarter than Tj in terms of intelligence, but Tj had certain skills that allowed him to keep up with the work easier.
3098	Tj had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10, which allowed him to skip grades 4 through 10 with no trouble. He also taught the grade 10 class and had arguments with teachers, as he was always right. Tj also was able to hack into numerous things, as he was featured on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults, who were very smart possibly comparable to Sheldon.
3099	TJ had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10, which enabled him to skip grades 4-10. Despite this, he was able to keep up with the work and even taught the grade 10 class, showing his intellectual capabilities. He also had numerous successes in debates, proving his intellect to be comparable to Sheldon's.
3100	Yes, it is true that the year starts in the middle of winter, meaning that there are two winters in a year, which could make the change more difficult. However, from a practical standpoint, having a weekend that is only one day long on each end could be beneficial, as it would provide more continuity between the week and a chance to enjoy the weekends more fully. Additionally, a longer weekend could provide a better balance between work and leisure.
3101	Yes, it is true that the year starts in the middle of winter, giving us two winter months to begin the year. However, having shorter weeks could be beneficial; for instance, having a four-day workweek with a long weekend in between could give us more flexibility to enjoy our free time. It could also lead to more recovery time and help us maintain a better work-life balance.
3102	As tempting as the “week debate” pun is (and it is!), the week generally starts on Monday, rather than being split into two halves with one day each end. This means that a workweek of five days is followed by two days of play, then repeating – or taking the week off and going skiing. While calendars that start with Sunday have more visual appeal, this is primarily due to symmetry.
3103	As tempting as the “week-start debate” is (and it is!), it is not feasible to make a shift in the calendar which splits up the weekend. A workweek is generally five days, with two days of play at the beginning and the end of the week to create a better balance. This is preferable to taking a “week” off and going skiing, but that is not the main point. It makes more sense for the week to start on Monday.
3104	Starting the week on Monday may make more sense to some cultures than beginning the week on Sunday, but biologically the week is still five days long, followed by two days of play. This creates an unnatural imbalance; in essence, the week is eroded in order to accommodate a desired length of time off.  Thus, while the current system of five days of work and two days of play may be more aesthetically pleasing to some, calendar design should not be the determining factor when it comes to starting the week.
3105	From the moment I walked in, there was something a bit off. No one greeted us, so my friends and I (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. When we sat down, the cook told us they couldn't serve us as they had no plates. We were a little surprised by this, as there was only one other customer in the building. We later found out that the place was open 24/7, but it didn't make sense to us why they had no plates if it was busy. In any case, we decided to leave and take our business elsewhere.
3106	When I entered the restaurant, there was something off about the experience. No one greeted us, so my friends and I (group of 5) decided to find a seat ourselves. Once I sat down, the cook then informed us that they had no plates. We then left, as it was not busy and would understand if it was. We were the only customer in the building at that time.   I would not return as the experience was terrible.
3107	Upon entering the restaurant, I was met with no greeting from staff, so my friends and I decided to find our own seating. Once we were seated, the cook stated that they had no plates, even though there was only one other customer in the building. This was surprising, as I understand that if a restaurant is busy, it is understandable why they may not have plates. However, if it was not busy, I don't understand why they had no plates. This was a poor experience and would not return to the restaurant in the future.
3108	From the moment I walked in, there was already something off about the experience. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. The kitchen staff then told us they couldn't serve us as they had no plates. After this, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I understand that a place can become busy quickly, but if it was only one customer in the building, it is concerning that they did not have plates. It was an overall not pleasant experience and I would be hesitant to return again.
3109	From the moment I walked in, there was something off about the atmosphere. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to look for a seat ourselves. Once I sat down, the cook said they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I understand that restaurants need to manage their resources, but with only one other customer in the building, it seems strange that they had no plates. It was a bad experience, and I would not return again.
3110	I recently visited the Planet Hollywood Sandwich Company and had a positive experience. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is inviting and the sandwiches are reasonably priced. I tried the Holiday Turkey and Full Montagu sandwiches, both of which were tasty. I was also pleased with the Original beef sandwich. The atmosphere and food make this a good choice if you're looking for a quick meal.
3111	Located inside the Planet Hollywood and open 24/7, this restaurant offers a variety of sandwiches including the Full Montagu and Holiday Turkey. These sandwiches are reasonably priced and taste great. The Full Montagu is a must try and the Holiday Turkey is the best of the two turkey options. If you prefer salads or soups, they are also available. The line moves quickly, so it is worth a try.
3112	Planet Hollywood is open 24/7 and offers a variety of sandwiches that include the Holiday Turkey and Full Montagu. These sandwiches are all under $7 and the line moves quickly. I recommend the Holiday Turkey as it is very tasty and has turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. The Beef sandwich is good but nothing special.
3113	I visited the Planet Hollywood location inside of the Planet Hollywood hotel, and it is open 24/7. The food is great; I enjoyed the Beef and Turkey sandwiches. Both were very tasty and a great value as the sandwiches are under $7. I prefer the Full Montagu and Holiday Turkey options, but the Beef sandwich was also very good. The line moves quickly, so it is worth a try. They also have salads and soups.
3114	Located inside the Planet Hollywood and open 24/7, this restaurant offers a variety of sandwiches for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All sandwiches are under $7 and the line moves quickly, making it an affordable and convenient option. The sandwiches are made with turkey or beef and are both tasty and satisfying. The Holiday Turkey sandwich is particularly noteworthy due to its flavorful turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. Overall, it is a great place to get a quick meal.
3115	The portions at this place were impressive and it was clear that more attention was paid to the food than at other buffets. Service was friendly and we were able to ask for a sprite drink later on in the meal. I enjoyed the New York Steak and the miso shrimp salad. I would like to come back to try the dinner option.
3116	This place's idea of individual portions is quite commendable. There is definitely more attention paid to the food than in other buffets. Service was pleasant, although it became a bit challenging to get a drink later on during the meal. The New York Steak was really good and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I would like to come back and try dinner.

The New York Steak was delicious and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I would like to come back to give the dinner menu a try.
3118	The portions at this place were definitely larger than other buffets I've tried. The food was also more carefully presented, which was nice. Service was friendly, although it was a bit difficult to get a refill of Sprite later on in the meal. The New York Steak was excellent, and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I'd like to come back and try dinner.
3119	This place's idea of individual portions is impressive. The food quality is better than other buffets, and the service was pleasant. However, it became difficult to get a refill of Sprite during brunch. The New York Steak was excellent and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I would like to come back for dinner.
3120	Raising Cane's is a tasty option for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/ or cole slaw (depending upon which size meal you opt for). I generally get the 3-finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast), as it is plenty satiating and reasonably priced. It's slightly more expensive than I expected, but still reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually hassle-free. Overall, a good fast food option for lunch or dinner.
3121	Raising Cane's offers flavorful chicken tenders and fries, accompanied with a tasty dipping sauce. Depending on the size of the meal, customers may also receive a side of toast and/or coleslaw. I always opt for the 3-finger combo since it is more than filling and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity. The staff are friendly and the drive-thru is efficient. It is a good option for lunch or dinner.
3122	Raising Cane's is a great choice for chicken tenders, fries, and dipping sauce. The portion size is generous and fills me up. The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy, and the drive-thru is usually hassle-free. Overall, a good fast food option for lunch or dinner.
3123	Raising Cane's is a great option for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a slice of toast and/or coleslaw, depending on the size of the meal you choose. For me, the 3-finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) is always sufficient in terms of both quality and quantity; it is reasonably priced. The staff are friendly and the drive-thru is generally quick. Overall, it's a good choice for lunch or dinner.
3124	Raising Cane's has tasty chicken tenders and fries, along with a delicious dipping sauce. Their side options of toast and/or coleslaw vary depending on the size of the meal. I always opt for the 3 finger combo as it provides a good amount of food for a reasonable price. The staff are friendly and the drive-thru runs smoothly.
3125	I recently had the chance to visit New Way's food truck for the first time. The food truck is located on a busy strip of Penn Avenue and the owner is very friendly. He makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an excellent price. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the service is efficient. I tried the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the hot Italian sausage sandwich which both were delicious. I would definitely recommend New Way if you are in the neighborhood; the food is excellent and a great value.
3126	I have had a positive experience at New Way Café. The owner is friendly, cooks everything from scratch, and offers substantial portions at an excellent price. The atmosphere is never too crowded, so he is able to prepare the food quickly. Both the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the hot Italian sausage sandwich were excellent, and the restaurant offers great value for money. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are in the area.
3127	I can highly recommend New Way Café. I live nearby and have been there several times since Arsenal workers recommended it. The owner is very friendly, makes everything from scratch and offers generous portions at an affordable price. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the food is always ready quickly. I have had the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the hot Italian sausage sandwich, both of which were excellent choices. I would definitely recommend giving New Way Café a try if you're in the area.
3128	I can't speak highly enough of New Way Cafe. I live a short distance away and decided to check it out after hearing positive reviews from Arsenal workers. The owner is very friendly and cooks from scratch, giving you generous portions at an excellent price. The atmosphere is always pleasant and the service is quick, which makes for a pleasant experience. The food is always cooked to perfection and I've yet to be disappointed by anything on the menu. Definitely a must-visit for anyone in the area!
3129	I recently visited New Way Café for the first time and was impressed. The owner is incredibly friendly, prepares everything from scratch, and offers generous portions at an excellent price. The place is never too crowded, so he is able to quickly make your meal while you take in the lively atmosphere of Penn Avenue outside. The Tuscan chicken sandwich and the hot Italian sausage sandwich were both great options; definitely worth trying if in the neighborhood!
3130	We have gone back to this restaurant twice now and have been dissatisfied both times. On our first visit, the steaks were overcooked, even though we ordered them rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who is not picky, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again.   The second time, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, then another 15 minutes for our food. When it arrived, the steaks were again overcooked. We were surprised, as we had ordered them rare again.   Overall, we were very dissatisfied with our experience and would not return again.
3131	We've gone twice now and were not impressed the first time. Although our steaks were cooked properly, the veggies were soggy and the lobster was rubbery. The second time, our steaks were overcooked, the veggies were still soggy, and the service was slow. We ordered our steaks rare, but they were still undercooked. We understand it takes some restaurants time to prepare the food, but it was unsatisfactory. We will not be returning.
3132	We have been twice now and while the first visit was decent, our steaks were overcooked. We decided to give it another try and ordered them rare, but the second time the wait time was 20 minutes, the food 15 minutes, and the steaks were again overcooked. The vegetables were soggy and the lobster rubbery. My son, who eats anything, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. When we got to the register, it took an additional 7 minutes for someone to come ring us up. The food was disgusting and I wouldn't have felt guilty walking out.
3133	We gave them another chance since the first time was decent, but our experience the second time was unsatisfactory. We ordered our steaks rare, but they were once again overcooked. The vegetables and lobster were soggy and rubbery. Even our son, who eats anything, refused to touch the grilled cheese. When we went to pay, it took an additional 7 minutes for someone to come and ring us up. We felt the food was disgusting and would not recommend it.
3134	We've gone twice now and have been disappointed both times. The first time, our steaks were way overcooked. We gave it another try and ordered them rare, but the steaks were overcooked again, even though we specified our preference. The vegetables were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything, took one bite of the grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. We were surprised by the high cost and had to leave without paying.  The whole experience was unsatisfactory.
3135	I tried the medium pizza from this restaurant for $9.99. When paying, they swipe my card and display the order total as well as the option to leave a tip. I think for take-out orders, the tip should not be requested at all.   The menu was not available on a wall; instead, it was projected on a touch screen. The pizza took about 9 minutes to prepare, which was slightly longer than expected. The restaurant's sanitation score was 97.5.
3136	Pizza was okay, although a bit expensive for a medium pizza at $9.99. When paying, they swipe your card and display the total, as well as asking you to hit 'no' for the tip - I would have expected this for take-out orders only.  The menu was displayed on their wall in chalk, which was slightly inconvenient. The order took around 9 minutes, though it ended up taking 28 minutes in total. This was their first store, with a sanitation score of 97.5.
3137	Pizza was okay, with a price of $9.99 for a medium pizza. When paying, they swipe your card and display the total cost and whether or not you want to leave a tip; I believe this should not be the case for take-out orders, as there is no menu available.   The restaurant had a good sanitation score of 97.5.
3138	Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, the touch screen display is moved so that you can enter your order total and whether you want to leave a tip. I would think that for to go orders, no tip would be automatically entered.   They did not have any menus available; instead, the menu was displayed on their wall, which was in chalk. The restaurant's sanitation score was 97.5.
3139	The pizza was reasonable in price at $9.99 for a medium size. The order total and tip option were displayed on the touchscreen, where you must hit ‘no’ for the tip and sign. It was a bit surprising that for to-go orders, they asked for a tip at all.      They had a menu displayed on their wall that was in chalk, which was quite old, as the place was newly established. The restaurant’s sanitation score was 97.5.
3140	Students should be allowed to express themselves more freely as they grow and develop. The uniform can create a sense of sameness in the school community, which can be restricting.
3141	Having a uniform policy can impose a sense of restriction on students in terms of expressing themselves. However, school uniforms provide a sense of unity and cohesion within the student body that can be beneficial for school communities.
3142	Allowing students to express themselves is important for their development, as it encourages them to be creative and think outside the box. However, the uniforms in many schools can create a sense of sameness that is restrictive, which can be seen as dull.
3143	Allowing students to express themselves is important in creating a positive learning environment. However, a school uniform can create an sense of equality among students, which is beneficial for creating a sense of community.
3144	Students should be allowed to express themselves more freely as they grow and develop, as clothing can be a form of self-expression. Having a uniform in place can make students feel like they are all the same, which can be dull.
3145	I believe that education should be largely self-directed, as this allows students to develop their own interests and skills and encourages creativity.
3146	I think it is important for children to have some level of autonomy so that they can learn to make their own decisions and explore their interests. This helps them develop the skills they need to be successful later in life.
3147	I think it is important for people to have some degree of freedom and autonomy over their lives, since this allows them to pursue their own interests, explore their own ideas, and make their own decisions. Without this freedom, people may feel restricted or limited in what they can do.
3148	I think it is important to have some level of rules and regulations in place to ensure safety and order in schools, but I think there should be some flexibility to allow students to make their own decisions.
3149	I think this type of education can be beneficial as it gives students more freedom and autonomy, which can help them develop their skills and knowledge more effectively.
3150	The school my mother works at and the school district my cousin’s three children attend are requiring uniforms. While this may reduce bullying on the surface, it does not address the issue. Additionally, it removes students’ right to express their individuality and the right to wear clothing brands of their choice.
3151	The school my mother works at, as well as the school district my cousin’s three children are in, are requiring school uniforms. While this may reduce bullying to some extent, it does not address the problem and simply moves the issue to another area. Additionally, it limits students’ rights to express their individuality and wear clothing of their choice.
3152	The school my mother works at and the school district my cousin’s three children attend have begun requiring school uniforms. While this might reduce bullying to an extent, it does not address the issue of student inequality or the students’ right to express themselves. Moreover, school uniforms do not prevent students from finding other reasons to bully each other. This takes away students’ freedom of expression and choice.
3153	Schools are requiring uniforms in order to reduce bullying, which is only a temporary solution as students will find other reasons to bully each other. Additionally, it limits students’ rights to be individuals and express their individuality.
3154	The school my mother works at and the school district my cousin's three children attend require students to wear school uniforms. This is meant to reduce bullying, which it does not address. It simply gets rid of or reduces the issue by having students wear certain clothing brands. This form of bullying is still an issue, and school uniforms do not address it. School uniforms also infringe upon students' rights to be individuals and express their individuality.
3155	Studies have shown that students are able to express and feel their emotions more deeply as they learn, which can help them become more intelligent and aware.
3156	Studies have shown that students are capable of understanding their emotions and expressing them, which can in turn help them become more knowledgeable and knowledgeable.
3157	Studies show that students have the right to feel and express their emotions, as this helps them learn and develop cognitively.
3158	Studies have shown that students are able to learn and acquire knowledge more efficiently when they are allowed to freely express their emotions and opinions. Although this can lead to higher levels of engagement and understanding, this approach to learning can be more effective in making students smarter.
3159	Studies have shown that students are able to best express and process their emotions in a safe and supportive learning environment, which can help them gain knowledge and develop critical skills.
3160	When you enter the workforce after college or high school, you are given more freedom to choose your own clothing.
3161	When you enter the workforce after college or high school, you have more independence to choose your own clothing, as workplace dress codes vary depending on the establishment.
3162	When you enter the workforce after college or high school, you have more freedom to choose your own clothing as appropriate dress codes are enforced in the workplace.
3163	When you enter the workforce after college or high school, you have the freedom to choose your own clothing to express your own style.
3164	After graduating from college or high school, when entering the workforce, you have the freedom to choose your own clothing style.
3165	I find that what works best for an individual could vary depending on the computer configuration and personal preference. It is difficult to say that one web browser is the best when it may not work on another person's computer. I prefer Firefox as it has worked better for me than Internet Explorer. The user interface is great and there are many extensions that can be used. It is superior to Internet Explorer after the 7 update.
3166	I find that whatever works for a person individually can be good, as each browser has different features that may work better for certain users. While I prefer Firefox, it is not necessarily the best choice; however, in my experience, it has worked better than Internet Explorer in my own usage. The configuration is relatively user-friendly and the tabs are great, as well as having numerous extensions available.
3167	I have found that Firefox works better for me than Internet Explorer. Its configuration is relatively easy to manage, and it has many good extensions. Internet Explorer's updates have been rather poor, which has only worsened the experience for me.
3168	I have found that Firefox tends to work better for me than Internet Explorer in my experience, both in terms of usability and performance. The configuration is relatively easy to manage and the tabs make it very useful. Additionally, several extensions make it superior to Internet Explorer in my opinion.
3169	I prefer Firefox due to my experience with it; it has worked better for me than Internet Explorer. The user configuration is convenient, and there are many good extensions available. While it may not be the best browser, it is superior to Internet Explorer.
3170	Since its launch, Firefox has had more downloads on the Windows platform than on the Mac platform, which suggests that Firefox has had more of an impact on the Windows platform than on the Mac platform. This suggests that Firefox has had a broader appeal overall than Apple's Safari browser.
3171	The majority of Firefox downloads have been on Windows computers, with a slight lead for Windows over Macs since its launch. Firefox has a higher market share on Windows than on Macs. This suggests that Windows users have been more open to using Firefox compared to Mac users.
3172	Firefox has had more downloads on the Windows platform than the Mac platform since its launch, according to data from Google Trends. This indicates that Windows users have been more likely to download Firefox than Mac users since its debut, which runs counter to the common perception that Firefox has always been the preferred browser of Apple users. Given its high market share, it makes sense that users have mainly opted for Chrome and Firefox rather than its main rival, Apple's Safari.
3173	Since its launch, Firefox has been more popular on the Windows platform than on the Mac platform, with Windows downloads accounting for approximately 58.6% of the total from day one. This suggests that Firefox has been more popular among Windows users than Mac users.

3185	Books provide a more engaging experience than television, as they allow you to use your imagination more, while television can cause eye strain and lead to temporary vision issues if viewed for long periods.
3186	Books provide a more engaging learning experience than television, as they require active engagement from the reader, which can help improve cognitive skills more effectively than television viewing. Books also present fewer visual stimuli, making them less likely to cause eye strain or vision problems than television.
3187	Books provide a more engaging and interactive experience than television, as readers are able to use their imagination to visualize the story, whereas television viewing can cause strain on the eyes and lead to vision damage over time.
3188	Books can offer a more engaging experience compared to TV, as reading requires active engagement from the reader. TV viewing can cause eye strain, particularly if done for extended periods of time.
3189	Books provide a more engaging and immersive experience compared to television, as reading requires concentration and engagement from the reader, which can help improve cognitive skills and stimulate the imagination more than watching TV. Additionally, staring at a television screen for long periods of time can lead to eye strain and headaches, as it can with books if done in excess.
3190	Books are preferable to television for several reasons. Firstly, television can have a negative influence on children, as parents may not monitor what their children watch as closely as they should. Additionally, books provide more educational value than television.
3191	Books are generally better than TV for children, as TV viewing can lead to negative influences, such as increased exposure to violence and adult content, which can be detrimental to children's development. Furthermore, most parents are not aware of what their children are viewing, making books a better choice in terms of content.
3192	I believe books are better than TV for several reasons. First, most TV content today is aimed at children and can have a detrimental effect on them due to the content. Parents are less likely to monitor what their children watch on TV compared to books, which I believe are better in terms of learning.
3193	Books are better than TV in some respects, as books provide children with more educational material and can help them develop cognitive skills. However, parents have more control over what their children watch on TV, which makes books the better choice in this regard.
3194	Books are better than TV in many ways, as parents have more control over what their children watch on television. This can be an issue as many parents are not as vigilant as they should be. Books, on the other hand, allow children to learn more as they offer more educational value.

3200	As population increases, there is less land available, which leads to higher levels of urbanization and crowding. India is facing the challenge of managing its population growth, which has led to an increase in corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, and violence.
3201	The growing population puts more pressure on limited land, which leads to greater density in certain areas. India is facing the challenge of urbanisation, which can lead to issues such as corruption, terrorism, illiteracy, and violence.
3202	The rising population puts pressure on available land, which leads to greater densities in urban areas. India faces the challenge of managing population growth while ensuring the quality of life for its citizens.
3203	As populations increase, the available land is stretched thinner, leading to greater density and Overpopulation can lead to a wide range of issues, such as India experiences a lack of resources, which can contribute to a range of challenges, such as corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, and violence.
3204	The growing population puts pressure on limited land, which can lead to issues such as overcrowding in certain areas. India faces challenges in terms of corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, and violence, which can hamper the country's development.
3205	I think if I had a father who was not present during my upbringing, I would not want him around as I would likely not have a relationship with him in the future, especially if the situation does not improve over time.
3206	I think if I had a father who was not present in my life, I would be less likely to want him around, as I may feel that the relationship is not worth sustaining, especially if I know that the outcome is likely to be negative in the future.
3207	I believe that if a father is not present in a child's life, especially during their formative years, it can be difficult to re-establish a relationship later on. Additionally, the absence of a father's love and guidance in the child's life may affect their emotional development and sense of security, regardless of the age of the child.
3208	If I did not have a father involved in my life, I would likely feel ambivalent about it as I get older; since father-child relationships often take time to develop, I may not want to spend time with my father if it is unlikely that we will build a strong connection in the future.
3209	I believe that if I did not have a father present during my upbringing, I would not want my father present if I knew our relationship would not improve over time. However, due to the nature of relationships, this could happen without an effort to maintain it.
3210	Having both parents can be beneficial in some ways, but it can also be difficult if there is friction between the parents and the child. In the end, it depends on the individual and their own circumstances. I have grown used to having only one parent since my father died when I was six; I do not have a favorite side.
3211	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers are. You still have other people to look up to even though your dad is not around.  I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there since he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
3212	I believe that having both parents can be beneficial, but it may depend on the situation. In some cases, having a father can be challenging as they can get on your nerves and make you do things you don't want to do. Nevertheless, it is still possible to have other people to look up to even though your father is not around.
3213	Having a father figure can be important for a child's development, however, in some cases having a father present can be challenging. I have become accustomed to being alone with my mother since my dad passed away when I was six. I do not have a favorite side, as both sides have their advantages and disadvantages.
3214	Having a father is important, but it can be difficult when they are not supportive or overbearing. Although I miss having a father figure, I am used to being soloe with my mom and having other adults to look up to, even though my dad is not there.
3215	I think it is better if you are fatherless rather than a bad father, as this may give you a better foundation to build upon. While this could provide a solid start, it may not lead to a successful life. If you are fatherless, you might feel adrift, but you can still gain guidance and correction from your father. This can give you the support necessary to succeed in life.
3216	I believe it is better to have no father than a bad one, as this can have a negative impact on your life. However, if you have no father, you may still be able to succeed in life and correct your mistakes, while having no father can give you a better foundation to build on.
3217	I believe it is better to be fatherless than to have an irregular relationship with your father, as this can potentially have a negative impact on your development. Although it may be okay to begin with, it is unlikely that you will fully adjust to this fatherless situation. Your father’s presence may encourage you to succeed in life and help you correct your mistakes, but it is unlikely that you will feel satisfied with this situation.
3218	Having a father in your life can be influential in shaping who you are as a person, so it is important to have a positive relationship with your father if possible. Being fatherless can have a negative impact on an individual, however, there are also benefits to having a father in your life. This can motivate you to succeed and also help you correct your mistakes.
3219	I think it is better to be fatherless rather than having a lousy father, as this can give you a certain level of protection, allowing you to make a successful life transition. Nonetheless, this may not be as positive as it could be, so you may need additional guidance and support from him.
3220	I would rather have no father than a bad one. Fathers are typically the providers for the family, and serve as role models for their children, teaching them how to become men and take on responsibility. So, if the father is bad, it can be just as harmful to have him around.
3221	I would rather be fatherless than have a lousy father. Fathers provide physical and emotional support for the family, as well as acting as a role model for the children. Although having a father is important for a child’s development, a father’s presence is not always beneficial if he is lousy. It is better to be fatherless in this situation.
3222	Having a father is important for a child’s development, as they look to their father as an example of how to be a man and have responsibility. In many households, fathers are the providers and solve any problems that arise. However, if the father is lousy, then there is no point in having him around. In this situation, it might be better for a child to be fatherless rather than have a lousy father.
3223	Having a father is important in a child's life as they look to their father for guidance on how to be a man and assume responsibility. Therefore, having an absent or bad father can be more damaging than no father at all.
3224	I would rather be fatherless than have an unsatisfactory relationship with my father. Fathers are typically the providers for the family and are expected to act as the alpha male, however, this can be difficult if the father-child relationship is poor. Children look to their father for guidance and to learn responsibility from him, so in some cases, it can be better to be fatherless.
3225	Having a father figure in their life is important for young boys and girls so that they can develop emotionally. As teenagers and young adults, it is essential to have support from a parental figure to help them navigate life and answer questions they may have.
3226	Having a father figure in their life is important for children to feel supported and have someone to learn the ways of life from. As young adults, it is essential to have support from a father figure who can push them to be successful and reach their goals in life.

This is important in helping you learn the ropes of life, as well as answering any questions you may have. As a young man, it is beneficial to have someone in your life who can offer support and push you to be successful.
3230	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern city, and he worked towards it. However, during Farquhar's time as Governor, Singapore's growth was hindered, which caused Raffles to be disappointed.
3231	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern city-state, and he worked towards this vision. However, while Raffles was away on leave, Farquhar struggled to develop the settlement in a way that pleased Raffles, leading him to feel dissatisfied.
3232	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be orderly, elegant, rational and modern, and he worked towards this. However, due to lack of proper development under Farquhar, Raffles felt disappointed.
3233	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern city. He worked towards this vision, but his efforts were overshadowed by the lack of development implemented by Farquhar while Raffles was away. This caused Raffles to feel disappointed.
3234	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be orderly, elegant, rational and modern, and he worked towards it. Although this was initially successful, Farquhar's development of the colony was less than satisfactory to Raffles, leading him to feel dissatisfied.
3235	Although Farquhar is credited with staying in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, strategizing and selected Singapore as a British base, giving the early Singapore an advantage. If Farquhar is deemed the founder due to his “grunt work”, should not the supervisor of a construction site receive more recognition, rather than the contractor? Moreover, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors, indicating that he did not leave of his own volition.
3236	Although Farquhar is often credited with staying behind in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, strategizing and was the one who selected Singapore as a British base, giving it early support. If Farquhar is considered the founder, the supervisor of a construction site should get the highest reward, rather than the contractor; Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of his own free will.
3237	Although Farquhar is commonly credited with staying behind in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, strategizing and selection of Singapore as a British base, giving it early support. Ultimately, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors, not of his own free will.
3238	Although Farquhar is often credited with staying in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning and strategizing that made Singapore a successful British base. Raffles was the one who selected Singapore as a base, and was the supervisor of the construction site, thus giving Singapore an early boost. Ultimately, Raffles was acting under orders from his superiors and did not leave of his own volition.
3239	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singapore the necessary support from the British. If William Farquhar is to be seen as the founder, shouldn’t the supervisor of a construction site get the most credit, instead of the contractor? Moreover, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of his own free will.
3240	Farquhar was entrusted with leading and developing Singapore by Raffles, who left Singapore to return to Bencoolen and oversee its operations. Raffles laid out the foundation for Singapore's growth, thus making him a founder.
3241	I agree that William Farquhar was largely responsible for developing and expanding Singapore, however, Raffles was the one who initially gave him the position, as well as laying down the foundations of Singapore's growth. His actions enabled the city's establishment, so he should be seen as a founder.
3242	William Farquhar was mainly responsible for keeping Singapore running and developing it further, however, Raffles had to leave Bencoolen to supervise the operations and return to Singapore, thus laying out the foundation of its development. Therefore, Raffles should be considered a founder.
3243	William Farquhar was given the position in Singapore to oversee its development and operation, while Raffles remained in Bencoolen to oversee operations. Raffles was largely responsible for laying out the foundations of Singapore's development, therefore making him a contributing founder.
3244	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, thus officially establishing Singapore as a British trading post. William Farquhar remained in Singapore to oversee its operations and continued development, but Raffles was ultimately responsible for laying down the foundation of Singapore's growth as it is today.
3245	Raffles established the Singapore Institution (now known as Raffles Institution) in 1837, which marked the beginning of formal education in Singapore.
3246	The Singapore Institution (now known as Raffles Institution) was established by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1837, completing its construction a year later.
3247	Raffles established the Singapore Institution (now known as Raffles Institution) in 1837, which marked the formal establishment of schooling in Singapore.

3253	Raffles designed a town plan to update Singapore into a modern city, with distinct areas for different ethnic groups, as well as provisions for roads, schools, and plots for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed to oversee the project.
3254	Raffles devised a town plan to transform Singapore into a modern city, with separate areas allocated for different ethnic groups and infrastructure such as roads, schools, and land set aside for government buildings. A Town Plan Committee was formed in October 1822 to oversee the project.
3255	Raffles believed that Farquhar had done a poor job of developing Singapore, as he had introduced opium selling into the city in order to increase revenue for expansion.
3256	Raffles believed that Farquhar had done a poor job of raising the city of Singapore, which he viewed as a major setback to its development. To generate additional funds, Raffles allowed the sale of opium in Singapore.
3257	Raffles was concerned that Farquhar had not done enough to raise the city of Singapore, so he introduced opium selling into Singapore as a way to generate additional funds for constructing the city.
3258	Raffles was concerned that Farquhar had not done enough to raise the standards of living in Singapore; he also introduced opium selling in order to generate more funds for Singapore's development.
3259	Raffles found that Farquhar had done a poor job of raising the city of Singapore, leading to its slow growth. To supplement funds, Farquhar had introduced opium trading into Singapore, which increased revenues for the development of the city.
3260	If one were to move to the conditions of yesteryear, it would be surprising if one did not contract a disease on a daily basis. Hospitals were another important factor that could have saved many people in such conditions.
3261	Given that living conditions in the past were often poor, it would have been surprising if disease was not contracted daily. Hospitals were one of the key factors in improving public health at this time, as better conditions led to better health outcomes.
3262	Living conditions in the past were often very difficult, and people would have been more vulnerable to illnesses due to poor sanitation and overcrowding in housing. Raffles Library and Museum provided a sanctuary of sorts, as well as improved living standards due to improved infrastructure.
3263	Given the poor living conditions of the time, it would have been surprising if people did not get ill more often in such environments. Hospitals were another way Raffles’ work helped to improve living standards.
3264	If one were to move to conditions in the past, it is likely that one would contract a disease in a month due to poor sanitation and lack of access to medical facilities. Raffles built hospitals to provide some relief, which could have saved many lives in those times due to the poor living conditions.
3265	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. While e-cigarettes have been shown to be less harmful than regular cigarettes, the potential health risks of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, making it difficult to definitively determine their safety.
3266	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. However, smoking cigarettes can be just as harmful and have similar health risks, yet it is legal in some countries.
3267	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. Although smoking cigarettes is clearly harmful, it is still legal in many countries despite its risks, meaning that regulations can be put in place to control its use.
3268	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. While smoking cigarettes can be harmful to one's health, it is legal in some countries and is widely available, meaning that it can still exist despite its risks.
3269	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. However, smoking cigarettes is clearly worse in terms of health risks and legality, but e-cigarettes and vaporizers can provide an alternative that does not need to be banned simply because it is deemed unsafe.
3270	If two people are in a relationship, they should be able to develop a strong connection based on trust, respect and understanding. Pornography can be an issue that can weaken relationships, so it is important for couples to talk and agree on a consistent set of boundaries.
3271	If a couple is in a relationship, they should prioritize one another and develop a strong emotional connection. Pornography can be a source of distraction and can threaten the stability of the relationship, so it is important to maintain open communication and mutual respect. While porn is not realistic, couples can still find ways to stay connected and satisfy their sexual needs.
3272	If two people are in a relationship, they should be able to develop an intimate and fulfilling connection without the need for other forms of sexual gratification. Through the love and respect shared between them, they can develop a strong bond that will withstand any challenges.
3273	If two people are in a relationship, they should prioritize each other's emotional and physical needs and build a strong connection together. Porn can be a factor that leads to relationship stress, so it is important to be aware of that and take steps to maintain trust in the relationship.
3274	If a couple is in a relationship, they should be able to make their own decisions regarding their intimate lives. Though porn may be a factor that could potentially split up relationships, it is ultimately up to the couple to decide what is right for their relationship.
3275	I believe that 'God' created the universe and allowed evolution to take place over time in order to bring about the diversity of life on Earth. We may be able to conclusively determine this within the next 100 years.
3276	I believe that evolution was created by God as a process to eventually bring about diversity on the Earth. Although God had a plan in place for evolution to occur, he still maintained an oversight of the process, allowing for minor adjustments over time.
3277	I believe that evolution was likely guided by some higher power to create the diversity of life on Earth, as suggested by many scientific theories.
3278	I believe that God created the universe and Earth, and that evolution was subsequently used to tweak the existing diversity of life on Earth. We may be able to determine these details more precisely within the next 100 years.
3279	I believe that evolution was guided by an intelligent force, which over time was able to shape the universe and Earth into its current form.
3280	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument is often used to illustrate evolutionary processes. It is believed that the black and white moths have evolved over time to provide better camouflage depending on the environment, allowing them to be more visible to their predators. This indicates that moth colors have the potential to change over time due to natural selection.
3281	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument.  I'm familiar with it, although I'm not sure how that fully proves the evolutionary process. Both moth colors have always been present in the environment, with the lighter color providing the moths with an advantage in concealment from their prey, which is due to evolutionary adaptations.
3282	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument is often used to illustrate the process of evolution. It is thought that the presence of darker markings on the moths' wings made it easier for them to camouflage themselves against the background of their habitat, making it easier for them to evade their predators. This provides an evolutionary advantage, allowing the moths to survive and reproduce.
3283	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument is often used to illustrate the process of evolution. It is believed that the changes in the coloration of moths over time can give them an evolutionary advantage, as the color of the moths is believed to be adapted over time depending on the environment, allowing them to be better camouflaged and thus making it easier for them to hunt and be eaten.
3284	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument is often used to demonstrate the process of evolution. It is true that both moth colors were present before, but it is the change in coloration which makes it easier for their prey to see which enables them to have better access to food, thus providing an evolutionary advantage.
3285	Evolution is a process that could have occurred over millions of years, with natural selection acting on species that have inherited beneficial traits, leading to the development of more complex organisms.
3286	Evolution is an indirect process that requires multiple generations of organisms with successive adaptation in order to produce new species and higher levels of organization. This process is unlikely to happen quickly, and is much more gradual and slower than what would be needed to explain the formation of new species and higher levels of organization.
3287	Evolution is a natural process that is supported by overwhelming scientific evidence and is much more probable than alternate theories such as intelligent design.
3288	Evolution is an unlikely process, as it requires multiple complex and interdependent factors to occur over a significant amount of time. It is much more plausible that evolution occurred due to a process of natural selection over many generations.
3289	Evolution is an active process that has occurred over many years, shaped by natural selection and other forces of nature. It is highly unlikely that a natural event such as a tornado going through a junkyard could create a complex structure such as a 747 airplane.
3290	I'm not an IE user, but I prefer Opera over Firefox due to its faster start-up time and better performance with Adobe Flash Player. Opera is still the best browser for me.
3291	I am not an IE user, but I have found that Firefox has some issues on my computer. It takes approximately 10 seconds or more to start when compared to the browser I use, Opera, which takes much less time to start. Additionally, Adobe Flash Player performs better in Opera than in Firefox. Firefox is still young and improved over IE, but I prefer Opera overall.
3292	I am not an IE user, but Firefox has some issues. First, it takes longer to start up on my computer than the browser I use Opera, which loads more quickly.

Additionally, Firefox is still young and I believe it is better than IE.
3294	I have used Mozilla Firefox for a few months, but I have been mainly using Opera. Firefox takes slightly longer to start up on my computer than Opera, and I have also noticed that Adobe Flash Player does not perform as well in Firefox as it does in Opera. However, I think Opera is still the best browser for me.
3295	Given that Firefox does not have ActiveX support, it makes the browser unusable for Windows VirtualEarth, which relies on this technology.
3296	(I am writing this through Firefox) Firefox does not have ActiveX support, which makes it unusable for Windows VirtualEarth.
3297	(I am writing this through Firefox) Although Firefox does not currently have ActiveX support, this can be a limitation in some cases, such as Windows VirtualEarth, it is still possible to use Firefox due to its range of alternative options.
3298	(I am writing this through Firefox) While Firefox does not currently have ActiveX support, this prevents it from being used in some instances, such as Windows VirtualEarth.
3299	(I am writing this through Firefox) Although Firefox does not have ActiveX support, it is still usable for many tasks, as it lacks only the Windows VirtualEarth tool. Additionally, there are alternative methods of accessing the tool which allow it to be used in Firefox.

Eventually, I stopped assuming God was real, which made me stop saying the Lord’s Prayer.
3336	How were you brought up? Yes, I attended church and school, and prayed before meals and at school and at night. I had questions about the Lord's Prayer at that age and, while I did not assume God was real, I stopped saying it. It was a personal journey of faith that shaped my beliefs.
3337	How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night?  I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped believing in God, since it didn't feel real to me. I was not forced to say the Lord's Prayer in school, but my public school system still encouraged it.
3338	How were you raised? Were you exposed to religious practices such as attending church or praying at home and at school? Even if you were not explicitly taught about God, the concept of faith and religion may have been introduced to you at an early age, which can lead to questions and doubts. It is natural to have doubts at that age, but it is also important to have the freedom to form our own beliefs and decide for ourselves what we believe.

3341	While there is some evidence that suggests a higher power may have guided the evolutionary process, there is still much we do not know about the universe and God's existence. Evolution provides an explanation that is more consistent with my understanding of the world based on observed facts and scientific findings.
3342	There is no definitive proof that God exists, and while religion and the Bible have some inconsistencies, I am less convinced of God's existence.  Evolution makes more sense to me, as animals adapt to their environment through natural selection over large amounts of time.
3343	There is no definitive proof that God exists according to religious texts and beliefs, which raises doubts in my mind. Evolution makes more sense to me as animals adapt to their environment over time through natural selection and adaptation to survive in different climates and situations.
3344	Evolution is a better explanation for the origin of species than creation, as it is supported by observational evidence from nature that shows animals adapting over time to survive in different climates and situations. This provides a more convincing explanation than religion and the Bible, which have too many contradictions and changes for me to be more confident in God's existence.
3345	I believe that focusing on the common good is more beneficial as it is better to give than receive. Additionally, helping others can be more rewarding than helping yourself, as it promotes a greater sense of unity and shared purpose.
3346	I believe the common good is a better goal, as it is more beneficial to give than to receive. It is better to give other people the help and support, rather than only relying on yourself.

3350	Both endeavors are better to be part of. However, I would like to work together to improve the common good in our society, making it safer and better for everyone. Everyone has unique aspirations and abilities, and I want to believe in the potential of each individual to pursue their dreams. With the help of our communities, we can do more than we currently do.
3351	Both endeavors are better to be part of. I believe that by having the freedom to pursue our own dreams and passions, we can create a better world, one in which everyone is able to reach their full potential and make positive contributions to their communities.

3354	Both endeavors are better to be part of. However, I believe it is important to strive for a better society, where everyone has the opportunity to pursue their dreams without the need for external help. We can teach people to believe in themselves and their capabilities, so they can reach their potential.
3355	I believe that working towards the common good is better for everyone as it ensures that everyone’s needs are taken into account and there is less potential for harm to others. If I was to only focus on my own interests, it would likely result in a world that was not as good as it could be.
3356	Advancing the common good is more important to me because, if I were to pursue my own personal pursuits, it wouldn't be as good as it could be. Choices that are selfish in nature would ultimately hurt someone else. I believe that it would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else's well-being before thinking about our own selves.
3357	I believe that pursuing the common good is more beneficial in the long run than making choices that would only benefit myself. Choices that focus solely on my own personal gain may do so in the short-term, but it would ultimately lead to a worse situation for everyone else. It is better to have an environment where we consider everyone else’s well-being before our own.
3358	Advancing the common good is preferable to me because if I were to pursue my own personal interests, it would not be as good an idea as it could lead to choices that would ultimately hurt someone else. I think it is better to think about everyone else's well-being before ourselves.

3370	Having a father is important for giving children a sense of security and stability, and while it is better to have a father than none at all, it can still leave a void in the child's life. If the father is bad, it can motivate the child to strive harder and take on more responsibility earlier on.
3371	Having a father in your life is important, even if it is not ideal. If you grow up without a father, you will always feel that emptiness. It could also cause you to become more responsible at an earlier age, as your father is not fulfilling his role. Though it is still difficult to imagine.

3376	I believe it is better to have a lousy father rather than to be fatherless, because growing up without a father can be difficult for some kids. For instance, there are some children who need fathers to teach them right from wrong, but at least you have some support and guidance from your father, even if it is not ideal.
3377	I think it is better to have a less-than-ideal father than to be fatherless, as having a father is always better for a child. This is particularly true for those children who need fathers to teach them right from wrong. Even if the father is not ideal, at least the child has some parental support and guidance to help them make decisions and offer encouragement.
3378	Having a father, even a lousy one, can be better than having no father at all since some children need fathers to teach them right from wrong. However, if you have a father, even a bad one, there is some support and guidance available which can help with decision making.
3379	Having a father, even a lousy one, is better than having no father at all, as growing up without a father can be difficult for some children. For instance, many children need fathers to help them make decisions and provide support. Having a father, even a bad one, can make a big difference in providing this support.
3380	I think it is better to have a father in a child's life rather than fatherless, as this can have a significant impact on a child's sense of security. Without a father, children may feel less secure, especially girls. Boys may feel as though they have to take on more of a fatherly responsibility as they get older, which should not be the case. Girls need the presence of a father in order to be more secure.
3381	I believe that having a father in a child's life is incredibly important, as it can have a significant effect on their emotional security. Without a father, a child may not feel as secure as they could.

3382	Having a father in a child's life can have a huge impact on their sense of security and stability, which is different from the mother's influence. Girls without a father are more vulnerable to a difficult childhood, while boys may feel the need to take on the fatherly responsibilities later in life.
3383	Having a father in a child's life has a huge impact on their security, especially compared to having only a mother. Girls who do not have a father grow up with a harder life than boys, who likely feel the need to take on a fatherly role as they get older.
3384	I believe it is better for a child to have a father in their life, as this can have a significant impact on their sense of security.

Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that their waste does not harm the environment.
3427	Although recycling can help reduce the impacts of plastic pollution, it is not the water company's responsibility to manage this; it is the responsibility of the government and consumers to take action to reduce plastic waste.
3428	Although recycling can help reduce the impact of single-use plastics on the environment, it is not the sole responsibility of the water company; plastic waste can still leach into water sources and be polluting.
3429	As long as people recycle, glass and plastic containers are sent to landfills and pollute the environment. While it is true that the water company is not solely responsible for this, the company does have a role to play in it.
3430	The Marriage issue should be left to religious institutions and the Church. Politicians and lawmakers should not have the power to legislate such matters, since marriage is a social institution and not a legal one, which could potentially break the Separation of Church and State established by the Supreme Court.
3431	The Marriage issue should be left to religious institutions, such as churches, to decide. Congress should not pass legislation that forces religious institutions to recognize marriage. Perhaps, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution and thus does not violate the separation of church and state as ruled by the Supreme Court.
3432	Marriage is a social and cultural institution that should be determined by religious organizations, as the government should not intervene in religious matters. While the courts have recognized same-sex marriage in some cases, this has been allowed by judges in accordance with the separation of church and state, as ruled by the Supreme Court.
3433	Given the Supreme Court's definition of marriage as a civil institution, it is best left to the government to make such policies and regulations regarding marriage. Therefore, it is reasonable for lawmakers and courts to have a say in the matter, as it does not conflict with the separation of church and state.
3434	The Marriage issue should be left to the Church as it has traditionally been regulated, as decisions regarding marriage are matters of policy best left to lawmakers and policy makers rather than mandated by law. Courts could allow gay marriage if it were legalized, thus avoiding any violation of the Separation of Church and State as ruled by the Supreme Court.
3435	Gay people have the right to make their own choices about their lives and relationships, which can be different from conventional marriage. I think this gives them the freedom to explore different options, which is beneficial for them in the long run.
3436	Gay marriage is a relatively new phenomenon, and it is understandable that gay couples may want to have the legal protections that come with marriage. However, I believe that having these legal protections in place is beneficial for both parties in a marriage, and thus marriage law is important for creating better social conditions.
3437	Gay couples have the right to make their own decisions regarding their relationships, and while it may be different from traditional marriage, they still have the same legal protections and rights as other couples. Therefore, I believe that they have the freedom to choose their own lifestyle, which could potentially change the future of marriage if more states enacted such laws.
3438	Gay couples have the right to marry in some countries, allowing them to have the same rights and benefits as other married couples. While this provides them with more choices in life, it does not provide the stability and certainty of marriage which would be beneficial for everyone.
3439	Gay couples have the right to make their own choices in life, and it is difficult to judge how they should live their lives when we do not have the same experience. If marriage were available to them, it would make life a whole lot better.
3440	Do we have the potential to grow further? Yes, although other countries may have grown faster in the short term. India often makes progress despite challenging conditions.
3441	Do we have the potential?  Yes.  India has shown its ability to develop quickly in the short term, despite the challenges it faces.  China has invested more heavily in the long term and thus has a better growth potential.
3442	Do we have the potential to grow? Yes, it is possible that India can develop its economy further in the future, although China has invested more into its economy in the long run.
3443	Do we have the potential? Yes. India has made significant progress in the last few decades, especially in comparison to China, which has done a better job in the long run of managing its economy. India also has the ability to make order out of chaos.
3444	Do we have the potential to grow more rapidly than China in the future? Yes, depending on our investments and reforms. China has invested heavily in its human and physical capital over the last few decades, which has enabled it to grow rapidly. India has typically been able to make order out of chaos in the short term, but its growth potential is yet to be seen.
3445	Why do you think we should be able to choose our own faith? It is important to recognize that people have different beliefs and religions, which impact the way we experience and view the world. As such, we should have the freedom to choose our own faith based on our personal beliefs and values.
3446	Why do you think we should be able to choose our own religion? While it is important to have freedom of religion, it is also important to maintain cultural and social cohesion in our societies, which may be impacted by changes in the religious landscape.
3447	Why do you think we need more diversity in religion? While we have many different religions represented in our society, these religions are often disparate from one another, limiting opportunities for people to connect with and learn about different belief systems.
3448	Why do we feel that way about this question? While there is value in understanding different religions and their beliefs, we believe it is important to explore other aspects of faith as well.
3449	Why do you think we need to be more inclusive in our curriculum? While we could include additional religions in our curriculum, we would need to make sure that we include meaningful explorations of these beliefs that allow students to gain an understanding of different belief systems.
3450	Atheism is a belief that none of the claims made in Christianity are true, based on logic, observation, and common sense. Atheism provides a more rational explanation for the origins of the universe and life than Christianity's claims of a creator.
3451	Christianity: belief in an all-powerful God who created the universe and rules it, along with a belief in judgment, heaven and hell based on one's faith and actions.  Atheism: the rejection of these claims based on one's own understanding of the world, which can include elements of rationality, observation and common sense.
3452	Atheism: the rejection of certain claims of religion, such as the existence of gods, based on logic, observation, and common sense, as well as an understanding that the universe and life on earth can have underlying explanations that are scientifically verifiable.
3453	Atheism is a belief that certain claims in religion, such as those found in Christianity, are unscientific and unsupported by logic, observation, and common sense. Atheism is based on the idea that such claims should be rejected based on these same criteria.
3454	Atheism: the rejection of these claims based on an understanding of the natural world and the ability to reason and make logical conclusions, as well as using observation and common sense.
3455	Oh lol. People have their own beliefs and it is impossible to prove either side, as both faiths rely heavily on faith rather than proof. Therefore, both sides remain uncertain until the end. I personally believe in Christianity due to my faith in God.
3456	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false is your own words, and I don't have to deal with this, whatever you think is your faith so we won't stop you. Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my faith and personal experiences which are hard to prove or disprove scientifically.
3457	Oh lol. People have different beliefs regarding God, and I don't need to provide proof to disprove what you believe. The idea of God is a matter of personal faith, and I believe God exists based on my own beliefs. Both views contradict each other, and neither side wins definitively.
3458	Oh lol. People have different beliefs and ideas about God, and that is up to individuals to decide what they think is true. We cannot prove or disprove the existence of God, which is why faith is an individual choice. Both beliefs contradict each other, and neither side necessarily wins. This is probably a conflict that cannot be settled definitively.
3459	Oh lol. People to point this out believing in God is called "faith" and we don't need proof to deal with this atheist's. The idea of God is false in terms of evolution and natural selection which we have observed to be true through science. This is not to say God does not exist, but evolution and natural selection is an accepted scientific fact which I base my belief on.
3460	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and had the luck to find a church full of people who were kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational Christian who still believes in the teachings of Christianity, but I have a more personal view where I believe in God, rather than religion.
3461	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was fortunate to find a church filled with people who were actually kind and lived what they believed. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational Christian, who still holds the beliefs and teachings of Christianity, although I see it more from a personal perspective, believing in God rather than religion.
3462	I was raised in a Free Will Baptist Church and was fortunate to find a congregation full of people who were genuinely kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational Christian, who still wholly believes in the tenets and teachings of Christianity, although I view it in a more personal manner.
3463	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was fortunate to find a church filled with people who were genuinely kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational Christian, retaining the beliefs and teachings of the faith, but with a broader view that encompasses God as well.
3464	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was fortunate to encounter a congregation of people who were truly kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational Christian who still fully believes in the teachings and practices of Christianity, but I have a more personal view: I believe in God, not religion.
3465	I am a Christian as I believe in a just God who will ultimately judge the good and bad deeds done on earth, according to His justice.
3466	I am a Christian, as I believe in a just God who will ultimately mete out justice for good and bad deeds done on earth.
3467	I am a Christian, as I believe in a just God who will ultimately bring justice for the good and bad deeds done on earth.
3468	I am a Christian, as I believe in a just God who will ultimately mete out justice for the good and bad deeds done on Earth.
3469	I believe in a God who will eventually do justice for the good and bad deeds done on earth, which is something I can reconcile with as a Christian, as I believe in an ultimately fair and just creator.
3470	I'm not a Christian, but I think that Christianity is a valid faith that offers a personal relationship with God, which allows for a deeper connection with Him than other religions. While Christianity may be different from other faiths, it is possible to have a meaningful connection with God that brings comfort and understanding.
3471	I'm not a Christian, but I believe that one's beliefs are highly personal and should not be imposed on others. Ultimately, what matters is the conviction that one holds, as beliefs are subjective and can vary greatly depending on an individual's beliefs and experiences.
3472	I'm not a Christian, but I believe that different faiths should be able to coexist peacefully. While some faiths may have certain core beliefs that remain consistent across all followers, this is not always the case, and it is difficult to definitively say which religion is correct unless there is a larger context to base an argument on.
3473	I'm not a Christian, but I believe that Christianity offers a powerful set of beliefs which can provide a basis for life. However, if two people have different beliefs, it can be more difficult to find a common ground to argue from.
3474	I'm not a Christian, but I believe that Christianity is a valid faith with its own unique beliefs and practices. While there may be some differences between the two faiths, these differences can be bridged if one's beliefs are based on the same concepts and principles.
3475	If God did not exist, it would be impossible for predictions for events thousands of years in advance to be written, as events were predestined by God for Jesus's life. This suggests that God had foreknowledge of the events that would happen in Jesus's life, suggesting that Jesus was predestined by God.
3476	If God exists, it is possible for Him to send messages predicting future events, which can be found in scripture. This suggests that God may have chosen to reveal these events in advance, which could indicate that He had foreseen them.
3477	If God existed, it would be possible for him to send predictions that could come true in order to validate his existence. Although there are such predictions that appear in the Bible, it is still possible that God chose to keep some of these details hidden until they actually occurred.
3478	If God existed, it is possible that He would have left records of His existence and prophetic predictions in the Hebrew Scriptures which could have foreshadowed events surrounding Jesus' ministry.
3479	If God existed, it would be possible for Him to send prophetic messages that foretold future events, as He did with the events surrounding Jesus' birth and ministry, which could have been written thousands of years before Jesus' birth.
3480	PE should be made an optional requirement in schools, rather than mandatory, to give parents the option of allowing their children to participate. Boys and girls should be separated into different groups, with activities being chosen that suit the needs of each gender.
3481	PE should be encouraged, but it is not necessary to make it mandatory. It should, however, be made an option for students to be involved in physical education activities. Boys and girls should be separated for activities if possible, as this could help build teamwork and promote interest in physical activities among students.
3482	PE should be made available to all students, but it should not be mandatory. At least some requirements should be set, such as ensuring that children are provided with physical activity. Ideally, separate boys and girls can be allowed to participate in activities tailored to their interests.
3483	PE should be optional, but there should be minimum requirements so that children can engage in physical activity. Boys and girls should be separated and given different activities depending on their gender.
3484	PE should not be made compulsory, but it could have minimum requirements to ensure the child is physically active. Boys and girls can be separated and given different activities depending on their gender to make it more enjoyable.
3485	It is up to the couple whether or not they want to be together; marriage may not be a legal commitment, but it does create strong bonds between couples. While there may be some legal recognition of a relationship, it is ultimately up to the couple if they want to be together. As parents, it is important to accept and support our children’s decisions.
3486	I believe that two people who love each other should be able to share their life together, if that is what they want. It is not for society to judge whether that relationship is valid or not. I believe that, as parents, we must always strive to support and nurture our children, regardless of their sexual orientation.
3487	I believe that two people should have the right to make their own decisions regarding relationships, especially if they are in love. Although marriage may not be a “high holy thing,” it is a symbolic event that celebrates the union of two people, which can create a strong bond. We sell marriage in many forms, such as on television and via drive-through weddings, which show society’s recognition of couples’ unions. Therefore, it is their decision to make if they choose to be together.
3488	I believe that two people should be able to choose their own relationships, and if two people want to be together, that should be respected. Having relationships validated by law or religion is not necessary for love to be real. However, if parents and society do not accept it, it could be difficult for the couple to stay together. As parents, it is important to be supportive and allow their children to make their own decisions.
3489	We often sell love in ways that make it easier for couples to stay together, such as through marriage, which is seen as a sacred union. However, couples should have the freedom to choose if they want to stay together or not. Ultimately, it is up to the individuals and their families to decide how they will handle it.
3490	Two of your links are from right-wing/conservative groups, and these have a strong bias against gay marriage. I did not have to visit the sites to know this, as #2 is a polling company and #3 and #5 have strong opinions against gay marriage in their writings. #1 has no direct relevance to the argument at hand.
3491	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups. These sources are biased against gay marriage, as I was able to tell from the websites without having to visit them. #2 is a polling company and #3 and #5 have strong bias in the arguments against gay marriage.
3492	Three of your links are from conservative/right wing sources, which provide biased perspectives on gay marriage. I did not need to visit the sites to know this, as #2 is a polling company and #1's arguments do not have a strong bearing on the argument at hand.
3493	Two of your links are from right-wing/conservative groups, which have a strong bias against gay marriage. I did not have to visit the sites to know this, as #2 is a polling company and #3 has similar writings. #1 has no direct relevance to the argument at hand.
3494	Two of your links are from right-wing/conservative groups. These are highly biased sources, as I have found by looking at the sites. #2 is a polling company, which could affect the accuracy of its findings. #1 has no real bearing on the argument at hand.
3495	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are sometimes put in place to protect the rights of some religions. This can lead to inequality and fragmentation within society. Laws should be created that are equal and fair for all men and women. This is essential for maintaining a united country.
3496	Gay marriage bans, as well as other laws, are in place to some extent due to the religious viewpoints of certain groups in the US. The US must remain united in order to ensure that laws are crafted in a manner that is beneficial to all people. Allowing a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another goes against the ideals of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.  The US Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion, which includes the right to marry who one chooses. According to the Supreme Court, this right should be extended to same-sex couples, as laws which limit marriage to opposite-sex couples violate this right. Laws that restrict such freedoms can have an impact on personal autonomy and equality, which goes against the core American values of unity and diversity. In this way, laws should ensure that all people’s rights are taken into account.
3497	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are often in place to ensure religious freedom is not infringed upon. It is important that laws are created that protect the rights of all people. While laws that favor one religion over another may be necessary in some cases, this can threaten the unity of a nation. Secular law is the most effective in ensuring liberty and equality.
3498	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are in place in some states to appease the religious majority, which could lead to division within a society. Laws should be made that are applicable to all people, regardless of religion, in order to ensure the unity of the country. Secular law is the only law that can effectively achieve this.
3499	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are in place to ensure that all people are treated equally under the law. The United States must remain united and laws must cater to the needs of all individuals, regardless of religion. Secular law is the best option for a functioning society.
3500	I believe that, in general, gay marriage is accepted by the population of Britain, as people in the UK are becoming more accepting of same-sex relationships. However, I think that couples should have the right to express their feelings to each other, which I believe is a right that should be granted to all couples, regardless of sexuality. I believe that this demonstrates that gay couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples in terms of marriage.
3501	I believe that the majority of the population of Britain would view gay marriage as wrong, but I believe that everyone should have the right to express their feelings towards the person they love. In other words, I believe that gay marriage should be accepted.
3502	I believe that same-sex couples should have the right to marry, as people should be able to express their feelings for their partners. Marriage should not be limited to one sexuality, and couples of the same sex should have the right to choose when and where they marry.
3503	I believe that gay marriage should be legal in Britain, as the majority of people in Britain feel that it is wrong. However, I believe that people should be able to express their feelings to who they love, so I think gay marriage should be accepted. I believe that couples should be able to marry who they choose, regardless of their sexuality.
3504	I believe that same-sex marriage should be legal, as people should have the freedom to express their feelings for one another. While the legalization of same-sex marriage may be controversial in some countries, such as the UK, I think it is acceptable in terms of giving couples the freedom to choose their own lifestyle.
3505	I believe that personal pursuit is better as I believe that helping oneself before others is natural. I believe that ultimately, whatever you do comes back to you; even if you are helping others, it is important to maintain balance in your life.
3506	I think that personal pursuit of one's goals is better, as I believe that helping oneself first is natural. I think that regardless of what you do, everything comes back to you; even if you help others, it could disrupt your life balance.
3507	I believe that pursuing personal goals is better, as I think that helping oneself first is natural. I believe that everything comes back to you even if you are helping others; it is important to maintain balance in your life.
3508	I believe that personal pursuit of one's goals is better, as I think that helping oneself first is natural. I believe that even if you do choose to help others, it will eventually come back to you, as you want your life to remain in balance in terms of helping others.
3509	I believe that personal initiative is better, as I think that helping oneself first is natural. I believe that no matter what you do, it all comes back to you; even when helping others, it is important to maintain balance in your life.
3510	I believe that helping a family member is the more important priority, even if it means going above and beyond for someone you don't know. In a similar situation, you will prioritize helping the family member even if it is someone you don't know.
3511	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what; you are more likely to help the family member than a random person you don't know.
3512	I believe that helping a family member is the priority, even if it means going out of your way to do so. While helping someone in need is admirable, it should be a priority to help family members first.
3513	I feel that helping a family member is always the priority, regardless of whether the person in need is related to you. However, if both a family member and a stranger are in need at the same time, you will prioritize helping the family member.
3514	I believe that helping a family member takes priority over helping someone you don’t know. Family ties are often stronger than those with strangers, and you will naturally put more effort into helping a family member in need.
3515	Homelife is an important factor in finding a job, and if you are able to commute to work, it may be seen as reasonable. I understand that you may need to stay at home for a while if the issues are affecting you. If it is the homelife that is the problem, I recommend reaching out to social services for help.
3516	It is important to have a supportive home environment, and while this can vary from family to family, it is important to have a sense of emotional and physical safety. If a family is close by, this could be seen as a more reasonable option, depending on the situation.
3517	You don't say much about your home life. You have to have a good reason for that. If you could get a job with a reasonable commute, I believe the counselors would allow that. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home, and I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If it is your home life that is the problem, get in contact with social services.
3518	You don't say much about your home life. This could be difficult, as living arrangements can impact an individual's wellbeing. It is understandable that you may want to stay close to home for as long as possible, however, if the situation is causing you distress, I believe it is important to get help from the relevant authorities such as social services.
3519	It is important to have a supportive home environment, and if possible, it is often better to remain close to your family. However, if the home environment is not suitable, it is important to involve social services if necessary.
3520	Since he was aware of it, he had the option of petitioning the court at that time to order the other party to return to the state. However, this would likely be viewed more favourably if done prior to the other party moving, or as soon as they move.
3521	Since he was aware of it, he may choose to allow some time to pass, as the court is more likely to view this as his allowing it, especially if he petitions the court to find her in contempt and orders her to return to the state.
3522	Since he knew about it, allowing too much time to pass could negatively affect the court's view of his petition to enforce the order, particularly if he did not petition the court until after some time had passed. He would have a better chance of success if he had petitioned the court sooner, or as soon as the other parent moved.
3523	Since he was aware of it, he had the option to petition the court at any time. If he waited too long, the court is more likely to view this as his allowing it, which reduces his chances of success. Petitioning the court sooner gives him a better chance of making the court order stick.
3524	Since he knew about it, he may have had a better chance of preventing her from moving out of state had he petitioned the court at that time, as the court is more likely to view this as allowing it sooner rather than later.
3525	People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue and even ask for an apology. A liberal's right to object does not automatically trump a conservative's right to express their own views, especially if the statement was offensive. A conservative may object and voice their displeasure, or a liberal may do the same, depending on the circumstances.
3526	People have a right to express their views, including the right to offend others. While people have a right to object to statements they find offensive, it is important to remember that everyone should have the freedom to speak their mind without fear of reprisal.
3527	People have a right to express their opinions and feel offended if they want, as long as it doesn’t cross any physical or legal boundaries. There have to be limits to what is acceptable, but it should not be imposed by the government or any other authority.
3528	People have a right to express their views without fear of criticism, and individuals have the right to object to certain statements, although this should be based on the merits of the statement rather than the personal beliefs of the objector.
3529	People have the right to express their opinions and beliefs, but this does not mean that others are unable to object to these opinions or express their own views. Everyone should have the freedom to do so, while still being respectful of each other’s feelings and opinions.
3530	In the United States, there is considerable debate and variation in the law regarding abortion rights. While it is legal in most states, conservative religious groups are pushing to make changes to the law. I believe that women should have the right to choose, as it is their body and their decision.
3531	In the United States, there is debate and controversy regarding abortion laws. In most states, it is legal to have an abortion, but conservative religious groups have attempted to change the law. I believe that women should have the right to choose.
3532	In the US, there is debate and variation in the legality of abortion, with some states allowing it and others attempting to restrict access. I believe in women's rights and the right of choice to be made by the woman concerned.
3533	In the United States, there is disagreement over the legality of abortion. Generally, it is legal in most states, although conservative religious groups are pushing to make changes to the law. I believe in women's rights and the right of choice to be ultimately the woman's decision.
3534	In the United States, the legal status of abortion varies by state, and there is debate about the issue. While I believe that women should have the right to choose, I am not pro-abortion nor pro-life.
3535	Capital punishment can be an effective deterrent to crime, although other alternatives should be explored first. There is no doubt that it is effective in reducing crime rates, although its use is limited by the jurisdictions comfort with it. It is important to take into account the potential of capital punishment as an alternative, as well as its moral implications and potential effects on criminal activity.
3536	Capital punishment can be an effective deterrent to crime, as evidenced by countries that have implemented it. However, it is an extreme measure that some countries are not comfortable with, and other alternatives should be considered first.
3537	Capital punishment can be an effective deterrent for crime, and it is utilized by countries with lower crime rates than the United States. However, this does not make it the preferred option; other alternatives should be explored first. This is due to the inherent risk of taking a life, regardless of the situation, which makes it difficult to morally justify. Additionally, while it may be effective, there are other solutions that are more so.
3538	Capital punishment is a powerful deterrent to crime, as evidenced by countries that have implemented it. However, other alternatives should be considered as well, as capital punishment should not be the first option. Additionally, while it is effective in reducing crime, capital punishment is seen as immoral by some as it involves taking a life. It is important to consider other alternatives as well, as capital punishment is not as effective as other solutions.
3539	Capital punishment can be an effective deterrent to crime and can reduce crime rates. It is ultimately up to the government and people of a country to decide if they are comfortable with it, as every country is different. Nevertheless, there are other alternatives that should be considered first.
3540	In some cases, when a lawsuit is dismissed it leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. This means that the case was not adjudicated and no resolution has been made.
3541	The dismissal of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. However, you may wish to consider taking additional action, such as sending a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. This letter should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports and a demand that these be corrected. Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies of the inaccuracy and demand a change. This allows you to protect your interests, while keeping the option of taking legal action should the company pursue the debt.
3542	Filing a lawsuit or taking other action to enforce a claim can be difficult and expensive, but it is possible to take steps to protect your interests. You could ask an attorney to help write a formal letter to the company, advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. This gives you the opportunity to take action should the company attempt to pursue the claim further.
3543	Filing a lawsuit or pursuing other legal options may be an option, depending on the state. Depending on the situation, it may be possible to take action to prevent damage to your credit report if the company continues to pursue the claim or makes harmful statements to credit reporting agencies. You can seek legal guidance to protect your interests in this regard.
3544	The dismissal leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt.  You should consult an attorney to explore your options and make sure your legal rights are protected.  Depending on your state’s laws, you may be able to take action to counter the company’s efforts and protect your interests.
3545	To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared capital punishment to abortion:  Capital punishment can be a proper punishment for serious crimes, as it removes the criminal from society and prevents them from committing further crimes.  In contrast, abortion terminates a developing fetus, which is seen as a controversial practice in many societies.  Generally, if a person has been convicted of a malicious crime, capital punishment can be an appropriate punishment.  It is up to the government to put policies in place to ensure this does not happen erroneously.  However, this does not prevent capital punishment from being seen as an appropriate punishment in some cases.
3546	To answer your question, while capital punishment and abortion both involve the termination of a life, there are key differences between the two. Capital punishment is used as a form of punishment for people found guilty of a crime, while abortion is used as a form of birth control. Capital punishment serves as a form of retribution for the victims and their families, while abortion takes away the chance of the baby having a life.  Moreover, the process of execution is subject to regulations and policies to ensure it does not happen without due process.  These regulations should also be in place to prevent wrongful executions.  Additionally, the government has the right to impose the death penalty as an form of punishment.  But the government does not have the right to prevent abortion.  In terms of innocence, the guilt of the person must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to put someone to death.  For abortion, the mother’s right to choose takes precedence over the baby’s right to life.  Thus, the government can choose to put someone to death if they deem it necessary while it cannot choose to abort a fetus.  Regulations should be in place to prevent wrongful executions, but it is ultimately up to the government to make that decision.  Capital punishment is permitted in some states in the US and in other countries, while abortion is legal in some countries and legalized in others.  In general, capital punishment can be implemented as a form of punishment if deemed necessary by the government.
3547	To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared capital punishment to abortion:  The fact is, yes, there have been cases where people have been put to death and subsequently found innocent. To prevent this from occurring, our judicial system must put in place policies that will ensure this never happens. Generally, if a person has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. It is understandable that this raises ethical concerns, as it does in cases of death penalty. In my opinion, if the evidence is absolute and there is no doubt of guilt, the death penalty should be implemented.  This reflects the seriousness of the crime, while ensuring that the innocent are not executed.  In comparison, allowing someone to live in a jail cell after committing such a crime goes against the punishment fit the crime principle.
3548	To answer your question, while the death penalty should be implemented in certain cases, there is a risk of wrongful executions occurring. To minimize this risk, proper protocols need to be in place to ensure accuracy. Capital punishment should only be used when there is no doubt of an individual’s guilt. Moreover, society should have the final say in deciding an individual’s punishment. In terms of abortion, unborn babies do not commit any crime, and abortion is a more common occurrence.
3549	To answer your question, capital punishment should be implemented when there is no doubt of a person's guilt since innocence cannot be guaranteed. Capital punishment is an effective form of retribution in certain cases, especially when the crime is particularly malicious. Furthermore, death sentences should only be carried out when there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To prevent wrongful executions, governments should introduce policies to ensure accuracy in the justice system. Generally, it is appropriate to put criminals to death in instances where guilt is certain. In comparison, abortion is a choice that can be made by the mother, which allows her to decide whether to continue or end the pregnancy.
3550	I believe that you should put a fence around any pool in Ohio to reduce the risk of any incidents. According to my understanding, if a pool does not have a fence, you could be held liable for any injuries or deaths that occur and this could result in the loss of your home, car and wages being garnished for a long time. Therefore, I believe it is better to install a fence, regardless of the law.
3551	I believe that having a fence around a pool is necessary in Ohio to prevent potential drowning incidents. This is because, if a child were to sneak into a pool without a fence, and a drowning incident occurred, you could be held completely liable for the damages, which could include the loss of your home, vehicle and earnings. Therefore, I would still install a fence even if it is not required by law.
3552	I believe that it is generally advisable to install a fence around a pool to reduce the risk of any incident occurring. In terms of liability, if a pool does not have a fence, the owner could face legal action, which could result in the loss of assets, wages being garnished and larger lawsuits. Therefore, I would still install a fence even if it is not required by law.
3553	I believe that pool fences are required in most states to help reduce the risk of children drowning. Although the law on pool fences may vary by state, it is generally recommended to have one installed to prevent any potential liability.
3554	I believe that it is best practice to install a fence around any pool to reduce the risks associated with having a pool. While it is not required by law in Ohio, there are risks that come with having a pool that could result in liability, which could lead to the loss of one's home, car, and wages. To me, the risk is not worth the reward, and I would still install a fence, even if it is not required by law. Additionally, homeowners insurance could be impacted by the liability issues if a fence is not installed.
3555	This is an interesting point. In the United States, anti-discrimination laws protect certain classes of people from discrimination in the workplace. Although age, gender and race are among the protected classes, white men are not covered by these laws. This means that, while other groups are protected, white men are not explicitly protected in the laws.
3556	This is an interesting point. It is true that the law protects certain groups from discrimination, however, white men are the only group that is not currently included in one of these protected classes. This means that while it is illegal to discriminate against them, they are not currently protected under the law. This is an interesting point, as it is true that in the United States they do not necessarily need protection.
3557	This is an interesting point! I recently learned about workplace discrimination, and the law states that no person can be discriminated against on the basis of sex, race, or age. However, the only groups that are not protected under the law are white men. So, technically, yes it is illegal to exclude them, but they are not covered in any protected class. It is an interesting point, as in America they are not always afforded protection.
3558	This is a great question!  I recently studied discrimination in the workplace, and these laws exist to prevent discrimination based on sex, race, and age. While white men are not currently protected under any specific law, it is still illegal to exclude them from protection. It is interesting that this protection is limited in the United States, which highlights the need for these laws.
3559	This is an interesting point. While the law does protect people from discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and age, white men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. This means that, while it is illegal to exclude them from certain job opportunities, they are not legally protected in the US.
3560	Technically IC Systems may be liable, but you would likely need to take them to small claims court to get them to pay.  My advice is to change your bank account number right away to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals. Then set up other payment arrangements with them. While you are doing this, inform them that you are reducing the amount owed by the $120 in fees they cost you. Pay down the account until there is only $120 left. If they continue to pursue you, refer to the letter and make them aware that you have a legitimate dispute.
3561	Technically IC Systems may be liable, but you would likely have to pursue the matter through small claims court to obtain payment.  To prevent further unauthorized ACH withdrawals, it is best to change your bank account number as soon as possible.  Additionally, setting up other payment arrangements with them may be helpful.  You should inform them of this in a letter and state that you will be reducing the amount owed by the $120 in fees they have cost.  This should be paid off until only $120 remains.  If they continue to pursue payment, you can refer to the letter and point out that there is a legitimate dispute.
3562	IC Systems may be liable for the charges if you decide to take legal action, but this would likely involve a trip to small claims court. To ensure that IC Systems cannot access your funds in the future, you should change your bank account number as soon as possible. Additionally, you should set up alternative payment arrangements and notify them of this in a letter. You should also let them know that you will be reducing the amount by $120 in fees. Continue to pay until the balance is $120, and then stop paying if the company continues to pursue the payment. If necessary, refer to the letter and make it clear that you have a legitimate dispute.
3563	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you would likely have to file a Small Claims Court action to obtain the funds.   My advice is to immediately change your bank account number to prevent future withdrawals. You should also set up alternative payment arrangements with them. In the meantime, inform them that you will be reducing the amount owed by $120 in fees. Pay down the account until there is only $120 left. Finally, cease payment if they persist in taking action. If necessary, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
3564	Technically IC Systems could be liable, but it could be difficult to get them to pay due to legal processes.  To prevent this from happening, it is recommended to change your bank account number as soon as possible to stop any further withdrawals. Additionally, it may be beneficial to set up alternative payment arrangements while contacting them to inform them that you will be reducing the amount owed by the $120 in fees. Finally, it is suggested to send a letter with this information, as well as make it clear that you have a valid dispute.
3565	In order to verify the information of a Social Security number, employers can call the SSA and provide the SS number or use other documents like a passport, state-issued ID, or birth certificate to verify the information. There are already laws and fines in place to ensure proper documentation of employees, and the government is currently considering new regulations to further strengthen these laws.
3566	It is true that the SSA provides employers with the ability to verify a Social Security number, though the process is more complicated than it should be. Additionally, employers may use I-9 documentation, such as a passport, state-issued ID, or Social Security card. While this can be done, it can be cumbersome and it is up to the government to make these rules more user-friendly. The government has already imposed fines and regulations on employers to ensure proper documentation of their workers, however, making these laws more effective should be a priority.
3567	We already have laws in place that make it difficult to verify social security numbers, making it more time-consuming for employers. Our government has chosen to put these regulations in place instead of making it easier for employers to do so. While it is still possible to verify social security numbers, many employers may not take the time to do so. This poses an issue in that it can be difficult to ensure the accuracy of employee documentation.
3568	Social Security numbers are often used to verify an individual's identity when applying for a job. In some cases, an Employer may require additional documents, such as a passport, state-issued ID, or birth certificate, in addition to a Social Security card. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) makes it difficult for Employers to verify Social Security numbers, as our government has made it more difficult to do so.  While laws are already in place that employers must properly document their employees, the government often chooses to create new regulations instead of enforcing existing ones.
3569	Employers can verify a person's Social Security number with the Social Security Administration (SSA) by obtaining an individual's SS-5 form. This form is used to apply for a Social Security card and includes the person's name, date of birth, Social Security number, and parents’ names. The SSA makes this information available to employers to ensure the information matches the individual’s records. However, due to strict government regulations, most employers are hesitant to take the time to verify this information.  Thus, it is already difficult to do so.  Moreover, I-9 documentation is required for employment which includes providing certain government issued documents such as a passport, state-issued ID, Social Security card, etc. This makes it possible for employers to verify the information.
3570	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it may be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any law should have safeguards and rational provisions to address the threat, rather than limiting actions based on speculation. Logic and reason should be a part of the decision-making process, but this is often not the case.
3571	I haven't followed this particular political case closely, but I believe that any law should be carefully considered and crafted in order to properly address the issues. Laws that are named after people can be problematic as the people pushing them may be more reactive to emotion rather than reason. It is difficult to predict the full impact of an action being made illegal without considering the potential combination with other actions. I am generally opposed to laws that make actions illegal simply due to the potential of causing harm. Instead, I believe that the people responsible for the harm should be punished.
3572	I have some concerns about naming laws after people, as it can lead to legislation that is driven more by emotion and grief rather than reason. However, I believe that any law should have safeguards and provisions in place to ensure that actions are actually illegal and not just potential combinations of actions that could cause harm. I am generally opposed to laws that make actions illegal purely on speculation.    In addition, the voting process has become more emotional, as people vote or legislate based on their gut reactions without concern for the consequences or long term effects. This is a concern as logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.
3573	I have some concerns with laws named after people, as the passage of an law could be based on emotion and grief rather than reason. Laws should have safeguards and provisions to protect against potential harm, and I think that punishing those who cause harm is more effective than limiting actions based on speculation. It is concerning that the voting process has become more emotional, and reason is largely abandoned in favor of making headlines.
3574	I haven't followed this political case, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it may be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any law should have safeguards and rational provisions to make sure that whatever action is illegal is the actual threat. I prefer to punish those who cause the harm and not restrict actions based on speculation.
3575	We need to be able to voice our dissent without fear of repercussion. Having the freedom to express opinions that we may not agree with is essential.
3576	Yes, it is important to be able to voice opinions without fear of reprisal, as this is a key part of defending our rights. When faced with unsavory policies, it is essential to be able to call out such actions while still guaranteeing such freedoms.
3577	Yes, it is important to be able to express our opinions freely. Having the ability to do so is crucial in ensuring that our voices are heard and that we can make our opinions known.
3578	Yes, it is important to be able to voice our opinions freely. However, it is equally important to be able to state opinions that differ from our own without fear of repercussions. We need to be able to do this without restriction.
3579	I believe that it is important to be able to express our opinions freely. We need to be able to voice our dissenting opinions without fear of repercussions from the government.
3580	I believe that standing together as a society and taking a stand against terrorism is important for maintaining freedom. We need to continue fighting terrorists in order to ensure freedom, justice and equality for all people in the world. Although the decision may not have gone our way, I think it is important for us to remain hopeful and continue fighting for the betterment of our country and society.
3581	We obtained our freedom by standing up and fighting for it. In the public eye, Iraq does not currently have the same level of freedom as we do, but we need to keep fighting terrorists in order to give people around the world the freedom, justice, and liberty that we enjoy. We are not dictators but freedom fighters who are willing to stand up and fight for our freedoms. We pay for this with our taxes, rather than relying on supposed federal or state money.
3582	I believe that our freedom is something that we have to fight for and stand up for. We can't take our freedom for granted, and we must continue to fight against terrorism in order to keep our country and world safe. While we may have the freedom that we have now, we need to stay vigilant in order to keep it.
3583	How did we obtain our freedom? By standing and fighting for it. Our freedom is earned and defended through the actions of our citizens. Although Iraq has its challenges, our citizens must remain vigilant in defending and protecting our freedoms. We must continue to fight against terrorism to ensure that the terrorists do not take away our freedoms. As citizens of the world, we must work together to promote freedom and justice for all. Although there are setbacks along the way, we must remain resilient in order to achieve our freedoms.
3584	I believe that our freedom is something that must be fought for and defended. We must remain vigilant in standing up for our beliefs and defending our rights and freedoms. We must stay engaged in the political process and make our voices heard in order to ensure that our country continues on a path of freedom and justice.
3585	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/infringe upon other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught, as penalties can be harsh. However, people tend to bend laws and break laws, as laws may not always reflect what is perceived as 'just'. You can voice your dissatisfaction through the legal system, either by taking the matter to court or by lobbying your legislature to make changes.
3586	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder other people’s rights/sentiments. Breaking a law can have consequences, so it is better to be careful and think twice before doing so. Laws are made to balance the needs of the society and provide safety and order. If a law is unjust or infringes on a person’s rights, it can be challenged in the courts or through the legislative process.
3587	Law is an obligation of the society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights/sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught; however, people tend to bend laws and break laws. The penalty for laws depends on the severity of the offense and may be modified by the legislature. If you are unhappy with any law, you can try to change it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to modify it. This process can be time consuming and difficult.
3588	Law is a fundamental part of society, and people must abide by it. While any law that violates rights can be seen as wrong, it is important to consider the impact on other people's rights and feelings. Breaking a law can come with consequences, but laws are right if they do not infringe on human rights or religious beliefs. If people are unhappy with a law, they can challenge it in the courts or ask their legislature to change or modify it. This process is time-consuming and difficult.

3590	I agree with you - the start of the displays has been creeping earlier every year, and it has now reached the point where my animals suffer as they seem to go off earlier. Even the main displays are starting earlier, which is especially inconvenient. I find this particularly concerning as the sale of fireworks is illegal for children, but they still manage to get them.
3591	I completely agree with you. My animals suffer every year as the displays begin earlier and earlier; I know of displays that are now starting in October, which is a problem as I need to keep my animals safe by sedating them.  It is also upsetting for them to go through this ordeal for weeks. Additionally, sale of fireworks to children is still a problem, even though it should be illegal to sell them in shops. Organised displays should be set for one night only, so we can help our pets by sedation.
3592	I totally agree with you. Here in the UK, the first big firework display I know of is usually around November 5th, which is later than it used to be. This can be distressing for animals, as it goes on for longer. It is difficult to sedate them for such long periods, as it affects them psychologically. I understand the concern, as animals are extremely sensitive to any changes in their environment.
3593	I totally agree with you. Here in the UK, the first major display usually does not happen until the beginning of November, which can cause problems for animal lovers as the displays can go on for weeks. I understand the need for animal owners to be able to help their pets by sedating them, as it can be difficult to keep them safe during the longer duration displays. It may be better to regulate the sale of fireworks in shops, with organised displays being restricted to one night only, allowing animal owners to help their pets in this regard.
3594	I completely agree with you. My animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. Even the main displays are starting earlier. I know of one that is already in early November, which is problematic for us animal lovers.   I cannot sedate my animals as it goes on for weeks. They are terrified. This is a particular issue for me as I have pets. I think there should be some regulations in place to make it safer for them, such as allowing sedation for only one night.
3595	Thank you for bringing up this important issue. While there are some instances where these technologies can be beneficial, there is a danger of them being misused. The Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined, and it is important to take proactive measures to ensure our liberties are protected. It is important to participate in the political process in order to ensure our rights are defended.
3596	Thanks for bringing up this important issue. While many of these technologies have beneficial uses, there is a danger that they can be misused. The Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined, highlighting the need to participate in the process of government to ensure our liberties are defended.
3597	Thanks for bringing up this important issue.  While there are some benefits to these technologies, they can be misused and have a significant impact on our rights if not used properly.  The Bush Administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined.  To properly protect our rights, it is important to be involved in the government process.  I hope this issue is not forgotten come voting day.
3598	Thanks for bringing up this important issue. Although there are benefits to some of these technologies, they can be misused if accessed by the wrong individuals. The Bush administration has shown the potential of our rights being undermined, with prisoners being held in Cuba indefinitely, without charges or access to legal defense. To protect our rights, it is important to stay informed and participate in the political process.
3599	Thank you for bringing up this important issue. While there are some benefits to these technologies, their use can cause harm when misused. The Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined, highlighting the importance of citizens participating in government to protect our liberties.
3600	If half the schools in the US think yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. The Constitution and Bill of Rights are usually taught in elementary school, with the Civil War being introduced before 6th grade. This knowledge is essential for understanding why America is America and why its freedoms and rights are enshrined in law. This is important for children to understand why America is America and not some other nation, such as Britain or one of its former colonies. (Historical context is important for children to understand why America is America and why its freedoms and rights are enshrined in law. Knowledge of this helps to shape a child’s understanding of the nation’s history and identity).
3601	If two-thirds of the schools in the US believe that the Constitution and Bill of Rights are taught in schools, I believe that teachers are doing a good job in including this history in their education. The Constitution and Bill of Rights are an important part of American history, and I would expect it to be taught before 6th grade. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, and so on, are all aspects of America’s history that are important for students to learn.
3602	If two-thirds of the schools in the US believe that teachers are doing a good job in terms of teaching history, then these kids need to be aware of their rights, such as the rights under the Constitution. In general, I would expect Constitutional history to be taught before sixth grade, followed by additional information in subsequent grades. As a result, students are able to gain an understanding of the concepts and principles of American history and the Bill of Rights.
3603	If half the schools in the US think that teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education, I believe that history classes should go beyond just the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The Founding Era of America, including the American Revolution and the ratification of the Constitution, should be taught earlier on to give students a broader understanding of US history. This knowledge can help students understand why America is America and not some other country.
3604	If 1/2 the schools in the US think the Constitution and Bill of Rights are taught, I believe these subjects should be covered earlier than sixth grade. This knowledge of the Constitution and Bill of Rights enables one to understand why America is America and not Britain or some other nation where taxes are paid on land we live and harvest from. (Hence, yes, this is important to understand why America has become America.)
3605	If we are speaking in the context of ethics, I believe that the child's right to privacy should be taken into consideration, and parents should be notified of any medications or charges involving their child.  In terms of legal rights, I believe that if the child is over 12, the state does not need to notify the parents regarding charges or legal actions taken against the child.
3606	I believe that the state should be required to notify the parents of a child in its care of any mental health treatment given to the child, unless the child is age 12 or older, for ethical and legal reasons. I also believe that the state does not have to notify the parents of any new charges or pending charges in this situation, due to the child's incarceration.
3607	If we are speaking in the context of ethics, parents should be notified of any medications administered to the child; legally, if the juvenile center is treating the minor for any type of mental illness, the state is not required to notify the parent unless the child is older than 12.
3608	From an ethical standpoint, parents should be notified if their child is taking medication, especially if they are younger than 12 years old. Similarly, in terms of legal rights, parents should be informed about any new charges or pending charges when their child is older than 12 years.
3609	I believe that depending on the age of the child, the juvenile center has the right to notify the parents if the child is under 12. However, in the case of mental illness, the state does not have to notify the parents if the child is older than 12.
3610	I believe that servers and waitresses should be paid at least the minimum wage, regardless of how much in tips they make. They work just as hard as anyone else and should be compensated accordingly. As for tips, they need to earn them through their hard work, especially if it is a slow night; they should not leave with less than 20 dollars for working 8 hours on their feet.
3611	I have never served as a server or waitress, but I believe that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should be paid minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. In the case of a slow night or no tips, they could leave with only twenty dollars for working 8 hours on their feet. I believe there should be a change in this, so that all employees should receive at least minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3612	I have never served as a server or waitress, but I believe that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should be paid the minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. In some cases, the servers may not make many tips after working for 8 hours, which could lead to lower earnings. I believe that there should be a minimum wage policy, regardless of the occupation.
3613	I've never been a server or waitress, but I believe that regardless of whether they make tips or not, they should receive minimum wage. They put in the same amount of work as anyone else. As for the tips, they have to earn them, and if a night is slow, they could walk away with just 20 dollars for working 8 hours on their feet. I believe there should be a change in this; everyone should receive at least minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3614	I have never been a server or waitress, but I believe that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should be paid the minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. In terms of tips, they need to earn them; however, if a shift is slow, they may walk away with only 20 dollars for working 8 hours on their feet. I believe there should be a change in this, as everyone should be paid at least the minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3615	I agree that people should have the right to say the Pledge if they choose to. No one should be forced to participate against their will. However, if an individual chooses to abstain, that should also be respected. Everyone has the right to assert their own allegiance to their country.
3616	I agree that individuals should have the right to choose whether or not they participate in the Pledge. No one should be forced to say it if they do not want to; everyone has the right to assert their own beliefs and allegiance.
3617	I agree that people should have the right to say the Pledge if they choose to. No one should be forced to join in if they do not want to, but a person's right to assert themselves and their allegiance to their country should take precedence over that.
3618	I agree with you. If a person chooses to say the Pledge, they should be allowed to do so. Others should be allowed to abstain if they choose, but they should not be forced to join in if they do not wish to. It is important to respect everyone's right to express their allegiance to their country.
3619	I agree that people should be allowed to say the Pledge if they choose to. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge; people have the right to abstain. However, I believe that saying the Pledge is a personal choice that should be respected.
3620	NO! Although organ sale could be an option to obtain money for an organ replacement if needed, selling organs is not advisable as it puts a price on human life and dignity. Life can be given, but it is a short-term decision that could potentially have serious repercussions if organs fail later in life.
3621	Firstly, the pricing of organs can be problematic as it creates an economic value on human life and dignity, an issue that should be considered carefully.  Second, the decision to sell an organ is generally made at a young age, and it is difficult to predict the long-term consequences. If an organ fails later in life, the individual may not have the funds to replace it. This creates a risk that the individual could be in a vulnerable position.
3622	NO!!  Firstly, because this essentially puts a price on human life and dignity. Life is a precious gift, and selling organs limits an individual's right to decide what to do with their own body.  Second, because it's usually a short-term decision that could be regretted if one lives long enough. You would sell only organs you can live without, such as a kidney or an eye, but what if, later in life, your remaining one fails, and you don't have the money to replace it? You could be in a bad situation.
3623	NO!   Firstly, pricing of human life and dignity is ethically tricky, as life is sacrosanct and we may not always have the autonomy to make such decisions. Selling organs is a personal choice, but it may come with long-term risks if the organs fail later in life.   Secondly, selling organs may be a short-term decision that could prove regrettable in the long run. We can only sell organs that we can live without, but there is a risk that later in life, our remaining organ might fail, and we may not have the financial means to replace it.
3624	NO!!  Firstly, because this essentially puts a price on human life and dignity. Life is a precious gift and a fundamental right, and the decision to sell organs should not be taken lightly. While you may be able to live without an organ, there is no guarantee that replacement organs can be afforded if a failure occurs.  Second, because it is a short-term decision that could be regretted if one lives long enough. Organs should only be sold if it is the individual's choice, as these decisions should not be made by the government or insurance companies.
3625	I don't think so.  I'm sure he's not the first student to think of this.  It's a given that tests are used to measure learning.  Obviously he's learned something, but he may need to take more steps to ensure he is able to demonstrate that learning.  He should focus on studying in order to maximize his potential.
3626	I don't think so.  I'm sure there are aspects of the curriculum that he has not fully absorbed yet.  Tests are an effective way to measure what a student has learned.  Studying harder can help him do better on the tests.
3627	I don't think so.  I'm sure he's not the first student to think of this.  Tests are an effective way to measure learning, but it is possible to learn valuable skills and knowledge through other methods. It is important to stay abreast of topics and knowledge, even if it is done through alternative methods.  There is no one way of learning, so it is important for students to find methods that work for them.
3628	I agree that exams can be a good way to measure learning, but it is not a perfect system. It is possible that he has learned some things, but may not have learned everything he should have. He should make sure to study and prepare for the exam in order to demonstrate his knowledge.
3629	I don't think so.  I'm sure he's not the first student to consider this.  Tests are a way to demonstrate what you have learned.  It might be beneficial for him to spend more time studying in order to ensure he performs to the best of his ability.
3630	If the daughter is 19 and deemed competent, then she should be granted access to the records. Depending on how much time has passed, she may be charged with theft if the documents are not hers. If years have elapsed and the daughter has not tried to claim the documents, they will be assumed to be the holder's documents. A lawyer should be involved in such matters.
3631	The legal age of majority in most states is 18, meaning that minors aged 18 and above are considered legally competent to make decisions with regards to their personal documents. If the daughter is 19 years old and the documents are hers, it is unlikely that anyone else will be held responsible for the documents. Depending on how much time has passed, she could be charged with theft if it is deemed that she had access to the documents in the past. A lawyer should be involved in the decision making process.
3632	If the daughter is 19 and deemed competent by law, then according to laws, the documents will be hers as no one else's. Depending on how much time has elapsed, she may be charged for theft. If enough time has passed, the documents will be presumed to be hers. Legal counsel should be involved.
3633	If the daughter is 19 and capable, then the documents are hers alone. Depending on how much time has passed, she could be charged with theft. If enough time has elapsed, the documents could be assumed to be hers. Legal involvement may be necessary in such cases.
3634	Under the Uniform Probate Code, if a person is 19 years old and deemed competent by the court, they have the right to inherit documents and records regardless of whether the parent is deceased or alive. Depending on how much time has passed, the daughter may be charged with theft if documents have not been previously claimed. It is advisable to involve a lawyer in these situations.
3635	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are difficult to convince, due to their personal beliefs. These beliefs mainly rely on faith in the government, which can make it hard to accept the reality of such events. Nevertheless, most people will come to accept these facts eventually, either when the country is put under Martial law, with curfews in place, or during times of emergency when people are detained in concentration camps set up around the country.
3636	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, although some people remain skeptical due to their faith in the government. These doubts are largely based on faith as people believe that their government would not murder its own citizens. It is likely that such a scenario will only become clear after a major event, such as martial law being enforced, with curfews in place and people being confined in their homes.  Luckily, the government has already built 600 concentration camps around the country, ready to be used if necessary.
3637	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are difficult to convince, due to their faith in the government. These faith-based reasons mean that it may take some time for people to accept the truth. Curfews and other restrictions could be imposed under martial law if necessary. There are also 600+ concentration camps built around the country which could be used to imprison people.
3638	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but some remain unconvinced due to their faith in the government. These doubts are largely based on their belief that the government could not have carried out such an attack. These doubts may take longer to overcome, but people will eventually come around as these events unfold in the future.  For the lucky ones, Martial law may be enforced and curfews implemented. For the less fortunate, 600+ concentration camps are already constructed and ready for use.
3639	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are difficult to convince, due to their faith in the government. These reasons are mainly faith-based; people may take longer to accept the truth that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. Eventually, they will come to terms with it, as it may happen under Martial law, with curfews already in place to restrict movement and ensure public safety.  The government has also built 600+ concentration camps around the country to detain those who are deemed a threat to public order and security.
3640	The primary limitation of public opinion polls is that there is a tendency toward bias in the questioning and sample selection process. In some cases, this bias can skew the results of the poll, as it is difficult to completely remove the influence of human intervention. Additionally, smaller and/or homogeneous samples are sometimes used by unethical poll takers to manipulate the results of their poll. In order to be completely reliable, polls should be designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention.
3641	Public opinion polls can provide useful information, but they suffer from several limitations. First, bias can creep into the process at any stage, from the question writing and administration to the sampling. This can be especially true for smaller and more homogenous samples, as these are sometimes used to save time and money. Second, polls will never be completely reliable until they are designed, administered and analyzed without any human intervention.
3642	The primary limitation of public opinion polls is that there is always the potential for bias to creep into the process. This bias can come from the person asking the questions, the person writing the questions, or from the person answering the questions. While this bias may not always appear in the results of an ethically conducted poll, it is a possibility.  Additionally, sample sizes and diversity are often not representative of the general population, which can happen to save time, money or both. Homogeneous samples can also be used to influence the outcome of a poll, which limits their usefulness.
3643	Public opinion polls can provide useful insight into the views of a certain population, but there are several limitations to consider. One limitation is the potential for bias in the survey process. The person asking the questions, the person who wrote the questions, and the respondent may all bring their own bias to the table. Additionally, small and homogenous samples are sometimes used to save time and money, and this can lead to survey skew. Ultimately, polls will be more helpful when they are designed, implemented, and administered with minimal human intervention.
3644	Public opinion polls can be subject to a variety of biases due to the involvement of humans at each stage of the questioning process. While ethical pollsters attempt to minimize this by taking samples from diverse populations and ensuring samples are of an appropriate size, this can be difficult and expensive. As an alternative, some pollsters may opt to use smaller samples, which can introduce bias and may not represent the general population. In addition, polls may never provide an accurate representation of public opinion due to this potential bias.
3645	When life ends, to the extent that people remember you fondly and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference. I believe that my involvement in my children’s lives will have a positive effect on them, as well as through various mentorship programs. I am satisfied that I will have made a difference, and that the lives of those who knew me will be better off than they would have been without my involvement.
3646	When your time on earth is over, to the extent that people remember you fondly, and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference.  I believe that my involvement in my children’s lives can have a positive impact that will extend beyond their own.  I have strived to be a good father, and I am confident that this will enable my children to have a better life.  I am confident that this will enable them to have a better life.  I am satisfied that my involvement will make a difference and that this will have a positive impact on their lives.
3647	When your time on earth is over, if people remember you fondly and are changed by your presence, you have made a difference. I believe that the values I have taught and the examples I have provided will have a positive impact on my children, as well as through various mentorship programs. I am content that this will result in making a difference in their lives, and that they will be better off having known me.
3648	When your time on earth is over, the ripple effect of your presence can extend to subsequent generations. As a father, I believe that my actions and words will positively influence my children, and through mentorship programs, I strive to ensure that their reality is enriched. I am satisfied that my involvement will have made a difference in the lives of these people and that they will be better off because of it.
3649	When your time on earth is over, the impact you have had on people’s lives is largely determined by how those close to you remember you and the lasting effects of the values you have instilled and the examples you have set. I believe that my involvement in these people’s lives can make a positive difference, which will enable them to have a better life than if I were not a part of it.
3650	I agree that it is concerning that companies can access and share personal information such as search records, as this raises privacy concerns. However, I believe that there is a need to balance these privacy concerns with the need for effective laws to protect citizens from illegal activities such as child pornography.
3651	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the government, which often happens in the name of fighting crime?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the government's agenda.  It is a crime to threaten the President, and while they may let some other content slide, they have been known to censor political speech as well.  I'm sure most liberals are like this, as well.  It is important to remember that governments have the right to regulate content in this way, so it pays to be aware and cautious of what we view online.  Regulations like these can affect our freedom of expression.
3652	Yes, it is possible that Yahoo has some biases in the algorithms it uses to determine what content to display and how it ranks content. However, Yahoo has stated that it does not give preferential treatment to one political party over another. It is also important to remember that Yahoo is a private company and therefore has the right to set its own policies and guidelines regarding content.
3653	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the government in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the government's agenda.  In the end, it is up to the government what content gets censored and what content stays.  Such practices may be beneficial to society, but it does limit freedom of expression.  I'm sure most people agree with the need for such restrictions, but it still affects users differently depending on their ideologies.
3654	Yeah, it's biased.  But what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet search records of Americans over to the government in order to supposedly combat illegal activities such as online piracy and identity theft?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the current administration's agenda.  This can create a skewed perception of the government's policies in the public's view, which could potentially influence policy decisions.  Although the government claims that this is meant to prevent potential crime, it raises concerns about the potential violation of civil liberties.
3655	Have you been standing in line for welfare programs and other government services for too long?  The burden often falls heavily on the middle class, who end up paying more in taxes than they get in services.  This can be especially challenging if you are a middle-income earner, as many government programs are targeted at lower-income households.
3656	Have you been standing in the tax line in the hot sun for too long?  While the wealthy pay less tax overall due to various exemptions and deductions, it is the middle class that bears the brunt of the tax burden.  This is largely due to state and local taxes which are highly concentrated in the middle class, rather than income taxes.  In other words, the middle class pays more in terms of taxes than other groups.
3657	Have you been standing in line to get access to certain services or benefits for a long time due to budget cuts?  This can be frustrating, as the middle class often gets the short end of the stick in terms of services and resources.  While the rich may pay more in taxes, it is often the middle class that pays the highest amount in terms of taxes and fees.
3658	Have you been standing in the tax line for longer periods due to higher taxes?  While the wealthy may benefit from deductions and credits, the middle class often gets the short end of the stick in terms of taxes, leading to a higher burden compared to the rich.  This is largely due to the tax system being less progressive and more regressive, which increases taxes overall.  This can be seen as the middle class paying more than the rich in terms of taxes.
3659	Have you been standing in line at the store or bank for too long?  The cost of goods and services has risen dramatically in recent years, leading to longer wait times and shorter profit margins for businesses.  This can be especially hard on middle-class households, who often bear the brunt of these costs.  It is true that taxes can provide a source of income for governments to help offset these costs, but the burden often falls heavily on the middle class.
3660	In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Patriot Act was passed to give the government increased surveillance powers to track suspected terrorists. While this may provide some reassurance in protecting the public, the limitation of civil liberties is concerning. This infringement on civil liberties is one of the most extreme cases ever seen in the United States, and it is a worrying sign that the government has been given so much power.
3661	Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, giving the government increased surveillance and detention powers. While these powers are necessary in some cases to protect the public, it is worrying that Congress chose to limit individuals' rights in this way. This goes against the core principles of civil liberties that are essential to a free society, and is a worrying development.
3662	This is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society. We are now reduced to the level of a police state. I believe these new powers are necessary to protect the nation from terrorist threats, but it is a major challenge to our civil liberties. It is concerning that Congress has chosen to give the President these powers, rather than requiring further judicial review.
3663	This is one of the fundamental rights in a democratic society. We are now reduced to the level of a police state. I don't blame the President for asking for this power; I blame a cowardly Congress for granting it. That's one reason the nation rejected the Republican-controlled Congress. While the President now has the power to designate a person as a terrorist accomplice, it does not mean they will be detained indefinitely; the government still needs to observe due process, as outlined in the Constitution.
3664	Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after 9/11, which gave the President broad powers to detain people if they are suspected of aiding terrorists. This goes against the fundamental right to a fair trial and to see evidence, as provided by habeas corpus. This means the government can now hold people indefinitely without charge and without revealing their location, which limits individual freedom significantly.
3665	Do you mean "employee"? And what's "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, which means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  However, there are limitations.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (e.g. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were a whistleblower in most states.   SEEK LEGAL ADVICE to determine if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment cases will take your case on a contingency fee basis, so you do not have to pay legal fees if you win your case.

3670	In some countries, including Australia and the US, identity theft can be easier since thieves only need one card to access someone's details. This could potentially create issues as it may be difficult for individuals to have documents such as an ID card in order to verify their identity. To tackle this, governments may require citizens to have a passport, driver's license, or other form of identification.
3671	I heard that in some countries, such as Australia and the US, identity theft is more common due to the use of identity cards. This is because the cards contain all the necessary information of an individual, allowing someone to access an individual's details without needing to go through many documents. This can be quite difficult to prevent, and it might be necessary to have an identity card to prove identity, or to have a passport, driver's license or other forms of identification.
3672	I heard that in some countries, including Australia and the US, there is a higher risk of identity theft since thieves only need one card to obtain someone’s identity rather than having to access multiple documents to obtain all the details of an individual. This could be very dangerous and costly, as individuals may need to show documents such as a passport, driving licence, or other identification cards in order to get an ID card.
3673	I heard that in some countries, such as Australia and the US, the prevalence of identity theft is higher since an individual’s personal information can be obtained from just one card rather than needing to access multiple documents such as bills and so on. This could potentially be quite risky, as individuals could be required to have an ID card in order to prove their identity, or may need a passport, driving licence or other forms of identification.
3674	In Australia and the US, it is possible for someone to steal an individual’s identity through access to only one set of details, as compared to having to collect multiple documents such as bills and passport to gain access to an individual’s identity. This could potentially be a difficult and costly process for individuals. However, as time goes on, the government may come up with a system that requires individuals to provide documents such as passports, driver’s licenses, or other forms of identification in order to access their identity. This may help reduce the risk of identity theft.
3675	I agree that no legal system is perfect, as court rulings are often subject to interpretation and arbitration. However, I am more comfortable with court systems that have an established legal framework, such as our own, rather than systems that rely on the input of a single leader, which raises questions as to the reliability of such judgments. For example, even though religious leaders often claim that god ordered their decisions, this has occurred only a few times in the last centuries, whereas court orders are much more formally established in many countries.
3676	I like very much the way you began: All rise! There is no legal system that is perfect, as legal systems vary in their effectiveness depending on the culture and context. I am wary of religions that have a central authority, as this authority can lead to unjustified violence, such as when one group claims that God ordered them to attack another. Lastly, the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq was controversial.
3677	I agree that no legal system is perfect; although, I believe that the courts have the potential to evolve and improve over time. Additionally, I am hesitant of systems that rely too heavily on religious texts, as I find it difficult to trust that God has communicated directly with leaders in many instances. For example, in the last 16 centuries, some leaders have claimed that God ordered them to attack other countries, such as Iraq under the Bush Administration.
3678	I agree that no legal system is perfect, and I am hesitant about systems that rely heavily on faith, such as religious law. Although I recognize the role that religion can play in society, I am still hesitant to completely trust it. For example, in the last 16 centuries, religious authorities have sometimes claimed that God ordered them to take a particular course of action.
3679	I appreciate the way you started the argument: All rise! While no legal system is perfect, I remain cautious due to the lack of verifiable communication from God. For example, in the last 16 centuries, religious leaders have claimed that God ordered them to take military action, such as the US invasion of Iraq. Additionally, a higher power's authorization of such actions has been assumed without concrete proof.
3680	I believe that the free market provides the most efficient and fair economic system, with the government's role being to provide basic services and regulations. I also believe that capitalism with strong social safety nets is the way forward, as it provides the best balance between economic freedom and social protection. In addition, I believe that the Bible provides valuable guidance for how society should be structured, though it is not necessary to have a faith in God to interpret the text in a moral manner.
3681	I believe that free trade and individual liberty are the most effective solutions for economic issues. I also believe that education is important for making informed decisions as a society, and that the Bible can provide a foundation for these solutions.
3682	I believe that free trade is an important part of economic growth, and I am open to market-based solutions to address economic issues. I believe that education is important and that public education has the potential to play a role in providing people with the skills needed to succeed in life.
3683	I believe in free markets and the power of capitalism to create a better world. I am wary of Marxist solutions as they tend to create more problems than solve them. I think the key to solving the world’s problems lies in the Bible, which emphasizes the importance of strong morals, families and communities. Public education can be useful in teaching fundamental skills, but I am skeptical of its ability to influence literacy or economic understanding.
3684	I believe that free markets are the most effective economic system, as they provide the greatest opportunity for individuals to pursue their own economic interests. I also believe that a education is important for society to develop and grow, and that public education can play a role in this. Additionally, I think the Bible offers valuable guidance for navigating the world's problems.
3685	I agree that it is important to show respect for our country and its symbols. Unless there is a valid medical reason, children should be encouraged to stand during the flag ceremony to show their allegiance to the flag.
3686	I agree that it is important to show respect for our country and its symbols. Unless there is a medical reason, it is a good idea to stand for the flag if possible. Our brave soldiers are willing to fight and risk their lives to protect our nation, and it is important to support it.
3687	I agree that it is important to show respect for our country and its symbols. Unless there are medical reasons preventing an individual from standing, it is appropriate to require citizens to stand for the flag ceremony. It is a way of showing appreciation for the efforts of our soldiers and the sacrifices they make to protect our country.
3688	I agree that it is important to show respect for our country and its symbols. Unless there is a medical reason, it is important to be physically present to show respect for the flag. I believe that pledging allegiance to the flag is important, and I will make every effort to support our country.
3689	I agree that it is important to show respect for our country. Unless there are medical reasons preventing someone from standing, I believe it is important to show respect for our flag by standing during the Pledge of Allegiance. Our brave soldiers are willing to fight and risk their lives for our country, and I believe it is important to support it.
3690	last time i checked, he still has the right to a court appearance until then. If he cannot make bail or obtain a bondsman, he will have to tough it out until his court date. Everyone has their lessons to learn, some get the rough end of things with no apparent reason at times. This is life, and you cannot always come to their rescue. Grown-up problems come with grown-up consequences that can be difficult to fix.
3691	last time I checked, he still has the right to a court appearance, unless he is able to post bail or get a bondsman, then he will have to wait until his court date. Life is full of lessons and sometimes the consequences can be difficult to fix. We have to learn to deal with these situations as adults.
3692	Last time I checked, he still has the right to a court appearance with an attorney until then; if he cannot make bail or get a bondsman, he may have to tough it out until his court date. Everyone has their own lessons to learn; sometimes the consequences can be difficult to fix.
3693	last time i checked, the courts have the final say on whether someone is able to remain in jail or is released until their court date. In some cases, individuals may be able to remain free until their court hearing if they cannot make bail or secure a bondsman; however, this varies by jurisdiction. If the individual does not like their current situation, it is possible they will have to learn from it, as these experiences are a part of life. While this can be difficult, these are the consequences of our actions.
3694	Last time I checked, he still has the right to a court appearance with an attorney until then. If he cannot make bail or get a bondsman, he will have to tough it out until his court date. Life is full of lessons, and some people have to learn them the hard way. While we can offer support and guidance, we cannot always resolve the issue.
3695	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women, however there is no conclusive evidence that I am aware of that suggests genes determine sexual orientation. I believe that people can convince themselves that they are gay, and that this belief is so strong that people come to view it as a choice.
3696	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. There is no evidence that I know of that proves that there are genes that determine sexual orientation; rather, people come to believe that they are gay and this belief is reinforced over time. Generally, gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that one's sexual orientation is not a choice.
3697	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determine your sexual orientation. While people may identify as gay or lesbian, I believe that this is an identity that people can develop over time. I do not discriminate against homosexuals, but the basis for gay marriage and rights come from the idea that being gay is not a choice.
3698	Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. It is possible that these instincts influence sexual orientation, although there is currently no conclusive evidence of this. I believe that people can convince themselves that they are gay, and come to believe this so strongly that they think it is something they have been born with. I do not discriminate against homosexuals, but the basis of gay marriage and rights is that being gay is not a choice.
3699	From a scientific standpoint, humans are born with the instinct to reproduce with women. However, there is no evidence that I know of that suggests that there are genes (or several genes) that determine one's sexual orientation. People may convince themselves that they are gay, and come to believe this strongly enough that it is not a choice. I do not discriminate against homosexuals, but the foundations of gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.
3700	Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before being approved to ensure competition is not distorted, the acquisition of smaller companies by larger companies is not subject to the same review, even if the value of the smaller company is large. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook access to a huge amount of personal data, which is part of its core business model. However, this transaction has not been subject to prior scrutiny, and I feel my rights have been violated as I have not been consulted or given the choice to opt out and delete my data.
3701	Although mergers of large companies are carefully analyzed before being approved, allowing them to form a single entity with too much power, the purchase of smaller companies by large companies is not given the same attention. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook access to a vast amount of data, which is Facebook’s main business model, allowing it to be the leader in selling this data. Although I believe these mergers should be analyzed further, I also feel my rights have been violated as I was not given the chance to consent or opt out of the deal.
3702	Although mergers of large companies are carefully analyzed before being approved, such that the merged company does not gain too much power in the market, the acquisition of smaller companies by large companies is not subject to the same scrutiny. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook access to large amounts of personal data, which is its primary business model. However, there has been no review of the merger, nor have I been consulted about the change in ownership of my data, something that affects my trust in the new entity.
3703	Despite careful scrutiny of mergers between large companies, acquisitions of smaller companies by larger ones are not typically examined, leading to a potential monopoly. For instance, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave the latter access to a huge amount of data, which is part of their business model. This raises questions about the potential violation of users’ privacy, as well as the lack of user consent and the inability to opt out or delete the data. Although users trusted company A with their data, this does not automatically give company B the trust of the user.
3704	Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before being approved to ensure competition is not disrupted, purchases of smaller companies by big companies are not usually subject to the same levels of scrutiny. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook access to a large amount of user data, which is central to their business model. This has been allowed without any regulatory oversight, potentially compromising users’ privacy rights. This raises questions about whether users’ consent was sought, and whether users were given the chance to opt out or delete their data.
3705	I live near a large navy base and I can understand why the military is viewed more positively in my community; however, I believe that college education should be prioritized more than enlistment in the military. This is largely due to the fact that college provides more long-term career opportunities compared to joining the military which is often seen as a last resort for those who do not get into college.
3706	I understand that the military is often viewed as more noble in my community than going to college, as college is viewed as a more desirable option. However, I believe this is largely due to a bias that war is wrong and military operations are downplayed in news coverage, political ads and television programs.
3707	I live near a large navy base and the military is often viewed as more noble in my community than going to college, as many enlistees come from my school. While I understand that what the military does is brave, I believe that going to college should be just as valued in my community. On the other hand, some members of the military are seen as heroes in news and TV programs, which I think should not be the case.
3708	I live near a large navy base and the military is viewed highly in my community. It is sometimes seen as more noble to join the military than to go to college, especially for those who do not get into college. On the other hand, if someone disagrees with the military or views war as wrong, this opinion is not accepted.
3709	I live near a large navy base and there is an appreciation for the military in my community. While joining the military is viewed as an admirable option for some after high school, attending college is generally seen as the preferred option. However, people who have the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military presence is negative are not as accepted in my community.
3710	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory handgun that holds 12 rounds. I believe that a person can be just as fatal with a handgun as with an "assault rifle". In my opinion, handguns are more dangerous due to their concealability. Assault rifles, such as the AK-47 and AR-15, are considered assault rifles even though they cannot shoot any faster than other semi-automatic weapons legally.
3711	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory handgun that holds 12 rounds. My view is that a handgun could be just as deadly as an assault rifle if it is concealable. I believe that handguns are more dangerous due to their smaller size. AR-15s and AK-47s are considered assault rifles, even though they cannot fire any faster than other semi-automatic weapons legally.
3712	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds.  My view is that a handgun would be more dangerous because it is easier to conceal. AK-47s and AR-15s are considered assault rifles, despite the fact that they cannot shoot any faster than other semi-automatic weapons. I believe that their looks alone do not make them more dangerous. What do you think?
3713	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds.  My view is that someone can take out just as many people with a handgun as they would with an "assault rifle".  IMO handguns would be more dangerous as they are more easily concealable.  AK-47s and AR-15s are considered assault rifles even though they cannot fire faster than other semi-automatic weapons (legally). While they may look scary, that does not make them more dangerous.
3714	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory handgun that holds 12 rounds.  I believe that a person can be just as dangerous with a handgun due to its concealability.  While AK-47s and AR-15s are technically considered assault rifles, they do not shoot any faster than other semi-automatic weapons, which looks scary. What do you think?
3715	My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will always be upsetting, but it is not something one should feel particularly emotionally connected to. We have no direct relationship with the animal and our connection to it is limited. I agree that it is understandable to feel nothing in such a situation.
3716	I agree with my sister that it was sad to watch the animal suffer, but I do not feel any strong emotions about it. It is true that roadkill can affect the environment, but it is an all too common occurrence that does not directly affect our lives. Therefore, I am okay with feeling neutral about it.
3717	My sister reacted emotionally to watching the animal suffer, while I did not feel any strong emotions. We each have our own relationships with nature; I believe that my relationship with the environment is more of respecting and accepting nature as an observer.
3718	My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I, however, did not feel anything. Watching an animal die is never pleasant, and while I empathize with the animal, I do not have an emotional connection to it. I recognize the animal’s death may have an impact on the environment, but I myself do not have a duty of care to the animal, nor do I have an emotional connection to it.
3719	My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I understand that seeing an animal suffer can be difficult, however, I believe that our connection to animals should be based on our personal experiences, rather than simply feeling empathy for them. We have no emotional connection with these animals; it is like viewing a tree in another field. It is understandable to feel nothing in this situation.
3720	With the advent of technology such as debit cards, the need for paper checks has largely disappeared. Direct deposit is a more efficient and paperless way for employers to pay their employees. From a consumer perspective, it seems that the only people still using paper checks are those who are more established, despite creating an inconvenience for those waiting in line behind them.
3721	Direct deposit has made paper checks obsoleolate for employers to pay their employees, while debit cards have replaced the need for paper checks for payment. Furthermore, outside of the workplace, paper checks seem to be preferred by some people who are hesitant to adapt to the new technology, causing an inconvenience to others waiting in line.
3722	Direct deposit has made paper checks obsolete in many cases, such as payroll and money transfers between accounts. In the workplace, it seems that many older employees remain more comfortable with paper checks, even though this can cause an inconvenience for those in line behind them.
3723	Direct deposit has made paper checks obsolete for transferring money in most cases. It is a more efficient, paperless process that is gaining wider acceptance among employers for paying their employees. While it has been accepted more slowly by the general public, some individuals still prefer paper checks due to the lack of convenient alternatives.
3724	Direct deposit has made paying for goods and services much easier, as it is paperless and eliminates the need for paper checks. However, some people still prefer paper checks, such as older people who are used to it and may create an inconvenience for those waiting in line behind them.
3725	Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back well. Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I believe that scholarships should be made available to both genders.  Schools and governments should be required to provide these scholarships to ensure equal opportunities for both genders.
3726	Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back well. Meanwhile, women have been more encouraged to pursue education and secure jobs, as seen in fields such as teaching and nursing, which are mostly female-dominated. This suggests that certain initiatives are in place to increase female participation.
3727	Men have been disproportionately affected by the recession, and remain more likely to be unemployed than women. Meanwhile, women are being encouraged to pursue certain college majors and careers more than men, with teaching and nursing being the most common examples. In order to address this, it is essential to provide equal opportunities for both genders.
3728	Men have been hit hardest by the recession, and have not bounced back well in comparison to women. Women have been more inclined to pursue education, as evidenced by the greater enrollment of women in college and the field. Moreover, many of the available jobs are more accessible to women. Additionally, governments and organizations have been offering incentives to encourage women to pursue certain fields, such as STEM, while men have not been given the same consideration.
3729	Men have been hit harder by the recession, and have not bounced back as well. Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There exist many secure jobs that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. To counter this, scholars and programs need to be made more accessible to men, especially in STEM fields where men’s unemployment is higher.
3730	In my opinion, Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is not very entertaining; cars driving in circles on a track does not make for an exciting spectator experience. I would rather watch a cricket game. Furthermore, the drivers do not have to be in shape; their bodies can endure high blood pressure. While I understand that it may be enjoyable for some people, I do not consider it a sport.
3731	In my opinion, Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is not as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I do not think that spending several hours in a stadium is enjoyable when watching cars go in circles. To me, this does not seem entertaining. I would rather watch a cricket game! The drivers do not need to be in shape; as long as their blood pressure is under control, their bodies can endure. Nascar is not a sport that people find entertaining.
3732	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. Although it can be entertaining to watch cars drive on the highway, it is not as entertaining as watching other sports. I would rather watch a cricket game! The drivers do not have to be in shape and their bodies can endure high blood pressure, meaning that it is not as physically demanding as some other sports.
3733	In my opinion, Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is not the most entertaining experience; cars driving in circles on a track for hours is not the most exciting spectacle. I would rather watch a cricket game. Furthermore, the drivers do not need to be in shape; their bodies can endure high blood pressure. It is not clear to me why people would choose such a hobby.
3734	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is not as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I do not think that spending several hours in a stadium watching cars circle one another is enjoyable. How is that entertaining? I would rather watch a cricket game. The drivers do not even need to be in shape; their bodies can endure it. While Nascar may be interesting to some people, it is not something I would find entertaining.
3735	In both cases, an authority felt the need to gain control of certain land in order to secure a military presence. This has led to instability in Ukraine and Palestine, which has resulted in deaths.  These events have caused tensions to rise between the countries involved, even though the motivation behind the land grabs may have been similar.
3736	In both cases, an authority sought to gain control of land which belonged to the people of Ukraine and Palestine. This has caused instability, which has resulted in deaths. These events have been influenced by the presence of external superpowers, leading to a perceived bias in the situation.
3737	In both cases, an authority felt the need to gain control of a certain area in order to secure their military presence. This has led to instability in the two countries, with deaths resulting as a consequence. Ukraine and Palestine have both experienced this situation due to similar motivations from two superpowers.
3738	In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing in order to secure their military presence. This has caused instability in Ukraine and Palestine, leading to deaths. While these events have caused tensions to escalate, it has been largely driven by outside intervention, with the two countries essentially doing the same thing.
3739	In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing, with one securing a military presence and the other wanting their holy land back, which has caused instability and deaths in both Ukraine and Palestine. This has been exacerbated by outside powers, leading to a power struggle between the US and Russia.
3740	The potential of bankruptcy to punish business leaders has proved ineffective in preventing moral hazard. Executives take risks with their firms’ money, confident that the costs of a crash will be borne by the public, whereas the rewards go to the business. Adding the personal risk of death penalty could be a deterrent to this. Moreover, it could also balance out inequity in the application of the law. Executives who are senior enough to have made key decisions may face the death penalty in certain cases. This could act as a stronger deterrent than the death penalty alone.
3741	The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders may be able to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. To correct this, it may be necessary to hold corporate leaders personally liable, as this could provide a deterrent. Adding the personal liability of death may help balance this inequality in the law, as well as provide additional incentive to ensure that leaders act more responsibly in the future.
3742	The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders may receive the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. This could lead them to take big risks that result in higher losses for the government. To counter this, government regulations should be in place to ensure that leaders are held personally accountable for their actions. This could include the threat of imprisonment or even death in extreme cases. This would ensure that leaders bear the cost of their actions and are deterred from taking undue risks with public funds.
3743	The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders get to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. This encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem. This would also help balance out inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down more harshly on the poor than the rich.
3744	The idea of using the death penalty to hold corporate leaders accountable is an interesting one, however I believe it should be further explored to determine its effectiveness in deterring such crimes. In regards to executive responsibility, it is important to consider the roles of both individual and corporate leaders in order to ascertain who should face legal consequences. This could help balance out inequities in the application of the law.
3745	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes state's violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals and then it can be justified. For example – imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. This is often justified as necessary to protect citizens from danger or harm, or to impose penalties on offenders in order to deter crime. Taxation is also a way for states to generate revenue to fund services, which is seen as a necessary part of a social contract or other broader systems.  We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say “drafted” when we could say “slave soldier” or “drug confiscation” when we could say “theft of herbs”. These euphemisms can dim the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.  One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish inquisition is to us.
3746	States often engage in acts of aggression against individuals, although this is sometimes justified as a response to initial violence from individuals. For example, imprisoning a murderer is seen as acceptable by most people.   Additionally, state actions such as taxation are often seen as valid by society due to the concept of a “social contract” or other vague ideas. However, these concepts can serve to obscure the reality of the situation and the potential coercion of such action.   We use euphemisms to give state actions a veneer of legitimacy. For instance, “drafted” is used instead of “slave soldier” or “taxation” is seen as accepted by the public rather than just one segment of it, when such actions are essentially theft.
3747	Governments often intervene to regulate and control activities within their societies, which can involve the use of force in some cases. This is usually done in response to violence initiated by individuals, such as when a government imposes laws to keep citizens safe. However, people generally view state-initiated violence more positively, such as when tax money is collected to pay for services. This is due to the concept of a ‘social contract’ which creates an understanding between the government and its citizens. Even so, these activities can be controversial. For example, when it comes to restricting certain freedoms, people may not agree with it.
3748	Governments often deploy violence in order to quell violence initiated by individuals, which can be justified in some cases. For example, imprisoning a murderer is seen as acceptable by most people. At the same time, taxation is seen as valid by many on the basis of a ‘social contract’ or other vague concepts.  We use these euphemisms to make state action seem more palatable.  One day, people may look at our society, which is run by governments using violence, and find it just as difficult to comprehend as we do the Spanish Inquisition.
3749	The state plays an important role in maintaining order and providing security in society. In some cases, the state's use of violence may be justified as a response to violent acts by individuals, such as when a government imprison a murderer.  However, the state often initiates violence against individuals, which raises questions about the validity of such actions. Taxation is often justified based on the idea of a ‘social contract’ or other abstract concepts, which may be difficult to understand for some people.  We often use euphemisms to make state actions more palatable, such as describing forced conscription as ‘drafting’ soldiers or confiscation of drugs as ‘seizure’. These terms can cloud people’s emotions when they encounter such situations.
3750	I believe that taxes are the cost of having a good government, as government services, personnel, and resources need to be paid for. However, I believe that high taxes are needed for this to occur, as the government needs to have sufficient funds to function. This allows for government intervention and regulation that is beneficial for society.
3751	I believe that government is necessary in order to provide essential services and resources to society. It is important to have government oversight and regulation in order to ensure that citizens are provided with quality services and resources. Higher taxes are necessary to pay for these services, personnel and resources. It is important that the government has the funds to be able to provide these services, personnel and resources.
3752	Government plays an important role in providing essential services such as law and order, infrastructure, education and healthcare, which can be expensive. High taxes are necessary to pay for these services, personnel and resources. While there is a correlation between taxation and good governance, I believe government spending should be carefully monitored and managed to ensure it provides value for money.
3753	Government is an important aspect of society that provides essential services and resources. Taxation is the cost of having a good government and higher taxes are needed to fund these services, personnel, and resources. While taxation does not necessarily mean a good government, a good government needs high taxes to do its job.
3754	Government is an important aspect of society that provides essential services, personnel, and resources that benefit its citizens. I believe that high taxes are necessary in order to pay for these services, as government spending is an investment in a good government. However, high taxes are not a guarantee of a good government; it is possible for a government to achieve its objectives without needing too much money.
3755	It is true that men who are wealthy, famous and good-looking have more opportunities to engage in sexual relations, making it more difficult for their partners to know for sure that they are faithful. This can lead to a greater risk of cheating for these men, which may cause anguish for their partners. However, the vast majority of men are able to resist these temptations, making it possible for their relationships to work.
3756	It is true that men who are wealthy and famous have greater temptation to have affairs than those who are not. However, this does not mean that all men find it easy to cheat; each situation is different, and women should be aware that infidelity can take place.
3757	Its possible that some men find it easier to resist temptation than others; there is no way of knowing for sure. However, it is true that women sometimes have a sense of vulnerability and concern when their partner is away, which can lead to an sense of anxiety and mistrust. This can lead to a feeling of being betrayed, even if there is no actual infidelity. This can be difficult to deal with for some women.
3758	I believe that it is more difficult for men to resist temptation if their partners are not physically present; this could lead to cheating due to the increased availability of sex with other women. Additionally, a spouse or partner could be surprised if they are not aware of the situation and feel betrayed if they are; this could lead to a feeling of infidelity even if it actually occurs.
3759	It is true that men who are wealthy and famous have greater opportunity to engage in extramarital relationships due to their increased temptations. However, this does not necessarily mean that such men are less likely to resist these temptations, since each situation is unique. Women may be surprised by their partner's infidelity, resulting in an unfaithful relationship.
3760	It is true that the Stormcloaks are portrayed as the villains of the Skyrim story, as they clash with the Empire in their attempts to gain independence. It is also true that the Empire is portrayed as the more heroic faction, as Ulfric is depicted as the leader of the rebellion while also being viewed as a noble and just ruler. While the Empire is seen as the good guys, the Stormcloaks are seen as more extreme in their views, and are viewed as more ‘bad’ than the Empire in this conflict. This is likely to show a contrast between the two sides in the story, illustrating the difference in their beliefs and their actions.  Additionally, Ulfric’s use of thu’um to assassinate the High King gives the Empire an edge in the story. While Ulfric’s actions are seen as more extreme than the Empire’s actions, it could be seen as more justified due to the Empire having more direct control over the situation. It is also worth noting that the Empire’s control of the situation is seen as more oppressive than the Stormcloaks’ control, further highlighting the difference in the two sides’ views.
3761	The Stormcloaks are presented as a more sympathetic faction than the Empire in Skyrim, as they are fighting to defend their culture and land against an invading force. This provides them with an understanding motivation that the Empire does not have, and makes them more human and relatable. While their actions are still questionable at times, such as their treatment of Thalmor prisoners, the game provides an opportunity to make choices that shape the player’s relationship with the Stormcloaks. This makes the player more invested in their journey, and thus gives them more depth than the Empire.  Additionally, while the Empire does use its power to oppress the Stormcloaks, Ulric did use the Voice to try and kill the High King, which further sets them apart as the villains of the story. In this way, the Stormcloaks are made out to be the clear “bad guys” of the narrative.
3762	I agree that the Stormcloaks are portrayed as the antagonists in the story, as they are opposed to the Empire and Ulfric, but I believe this is mainly due to their differences in culture and beliefs, which make them appear more dangerous and intimidating than Ulfric and the Empire. While this may make them seem more evil in the context of the game, I believe it is mainly to highlight the contrast between the two factions, rather than to portray the Stormcloaks as the villains of the game.
3763	The argument raises some valid points about the Stormcloaks being portrayed as the villains in the game. While it is true that they are different from the rest of the societies in Skyrim and use thu'um to kill the High King, there is no clear evidence that Ulfric is the mastermind behind it. It could also be argued that the game paints the Stormcloaks as the bad guys because of their more isolationist beliefs and the oppression of those different from them. This creates a contrast between their culture and the other societies in Skyrim, making them appear as the villains.
3764	I believe that the Stormcloaks are portrayed as the antagonists of the main quest of Skyrim mainly due to their refusal to accept the Lag infering treaty, as well as their religious and cultural differences with the empire. While the Stormcloaks' actions may be seen as morally dubious by modern standards, the game does not provide an alternative perspective to paint them as the villains. Additionally, Ulfric's use of Thu'um to kill the High King further emphasizes this point, as it highlights his willingness to use extreme measures to achieve his goals.
3765	I believe the word they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture, which has spread beyond its African American roots. While there are elements of the culture that can be seen as negative, there have been changes in this respect, with less sexism, racism, and homophobia in rap music, as well as greater respect for others. Additionally, the disrespect towards property and the glorification of violent acts is decreasing.
3766	I believe the phrase they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture, which has become increasingly popular among younger generations. While there are positive aspects to this culture, such as increased social mobility and expression, there are also elements that have proven problematic. For instance, there is a large amount of sexism, homophobia and racism present in rap music and its associated culture. Additionally, there is a certain level of disrespect that is glorified in these videos, as well as the destruction of public property and lack of regard for law and order. This has caused some concern in society.
3767	I believe that the culture of Hip Hop has the potential to positively influence society, but there are aspects that have been detrimental to it. For example, many rap songs promote sexism, homophobia and racism. Additionally, the culture glorifies violence, with videos of ‘knockout games’ and vandalism becoming popular, which is disgraceful. While this culture is slowly changing, it is still an issue.
3768	I believe the term they may be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture, which has grown increasingly popular in recent years, particularly among younger people. While elements of this culture can be positive and enjoyable, there are also aspects that can have a negative impact on society. For example, many rap songs promote sexism, homophobia, and racism, as well as disrespect towards others. This is slowly changing, however, it is still an issue. Additionally, there is the general disrespect that is seen in the culture, which is reinforced by videos of social media such as Vine. This is a concern.
3769	I believe the term they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture, which has grown largely from the African American community. While elements of this culture can be positive, there are aspects that have originated from it that can be detrimental to society. This includes sexism, homophobia and racism in rap music, as well as a lack of respect for public and private property. This has been slowly changing, but it is still an issue.
3770	Christian A accepts that evolution is true and that carbon dating and fossil records are reliable sources of information, believing that humans descended from a common ancestor and that life on Earth was shaped by natural processes. Christian A also believes that there is likely life on other planets in the universe, but that we have yet to discover and explore them. They believe that there is a higher power or ‘being’ that oversees the universe, but this ‘being’ is less concrete than the traditional Christian view of God. Christian A does not discount the possibility of an afterlife, but this is a matter of personal faith and belief, rather than a concrete certainty.
3771	Christian A accepts that evolution is true and that God is more a “higher being” than an entity from the Bible, while Christian B believes that carbon dating and fossil records provide evidence of an ancient Earth and that God is a “higher being” who created the universe. Christian A also accepts that Christian B’s beliefs about evolution and the age of the Earth are scientifically proven. Although Christian A and B have different beliefs, both faiths have values that are in line with Christian values.
3772	Christian A accepts that evolution is true, and believes that life on earth evolved over time, with God as the ultimate source of creation. Christian A believes in a Supreme Being or higher power, but sees evolution as the primary way that God created life on earth. Christian A accepts the scientific findings on carbon dating and fossils, as well as the notion that humans have existed alongside other life on earth for millions of years.  Christian A believes that other forms of life may exist in undiscovered universes, but that life on earth was created by God.
3773	Christian A accepts that evolution is true, believing that humans descended from a common ancestor and that species have evolved over time. They recognize the scientific proof of carbon dating and fossil records, and believe that the Earth is older than what is stated in the Bible. Christian A also recognizes that there may be other life forms in the universe, but that we have not yet discovered them. They acknowledge that a higher power may exist, but that God is simply a higher being than what is described in the Bible. Finally, Christian A believes that rewards may be given after death for being a good person.  Christian B believes in the same concepts, but with a slightly different interpretation.  Christian A is more open to accepting new scientific discoveries than Christian B.  There is some variance in their beliefs, but the main concepts are the same.  Christian A acknowledges the scientific facts and does not completely deny what is scientifically proven. They are open to new ideas, while Christian B has a slightly more conservative view.  Christian A is more accepting of new scientific discoveries than Christian B.
3774	Christian A accepts that evolution is true, believes in an older version of God that is consistent with the 21st century and does not deny scientific evidence. Christian B believes in God as a higher being, but does not necessarily believe in a reward after death for being a good person. Both faiths can coexist with one another without having to deny scientific facts.
3775	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation, as it provided a sense of discipline and control. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated, I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later.    Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This experience confirms my initial feelings about masturbation; it can be bad for mental health if done frequently. Studies or personal experience could help change my view on this.
3776	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later.    Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This experience validates my initial thoughts that masturbation is generally not good for you, at least in the long-term. It could be beneficial for you to have more experience with it yourself, or through studies, to change my view.
3777	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation. I knew that this was beneficial for my overall wellbeing, as it allowed me to break the habit of masturbating compulsively. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated, I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing that I would just masturbate again sometime later.   Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel more stressed and depressed than before, confirming my initial view that it is not beneficial for me in the long-term. Studies or my own experience could change my view, although I believe that the balance between one's physical and mental health is crucial and one should avoid masturbation if possible.
3778	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later.    Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This confirms my initial feelings about masturbation. It could be beneficial for some people with experience, but for me it has not been the case.
3779	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt good about it. I had a sense of pride when a day passed without masturbation squeezed in there. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbating. Each time I masturbated I felt a sense of dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later.    Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms my initial view that masturbation is not good for me. Even if study results show otherwise, my personal experience is that it is bad for me, as I still feel the same way after masturbating.
3780	We are all capable of committing horrendous acts if the right circumstances and societal influences allow it. I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities Hitler committed; I am simply suggesting that such acts could occur in any individual if not kept in check by continual learning and growth. The idea of eugenics was a major factor behind his Aryan superiority complex, which could explain some of his attitudes. War is war, and people can justify terrible acts when in such a situation.
3781	We are all capable of committing horrendous acts under certain circumstances. Hitler’s actions were fueled by his Aryan superiority complex, which was influenced by eugenics. War is war, and people can justify actions that they find acceptable when in that mode. I am disgusted by what he did, but I recognize that I could also do such things if I am not continuously learning and growing.
3782	I agree that we could all be capable of committing terrible acts under the right circumstances. It is important to continuously learn and grow in order to prevent this from happening. While I do not condone any of Hitler’s actions, I believe that historical context and the influence of society can contribute to such actions.
3783	We are all capable of the atrocities that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us. I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities he engaged in.  However, there is historical perspective that could perhaps explain some of his attitudes.  Additionally, war brings its own set of horrors that make people more inclined to commit horrible acts.  I am thoroughly disgusted by what he did, but I do not discount the possibility that I am capable of similar things if I do not keep a focus on continually learning and growing and evolving in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
3784	We are all capable of committing terrible acts under certain conditions. Social and environmental influences can play a role in determining whether or not someone is capable of similar acts. While I do not condone any of the atrocities Hitler committed, there is a historical perspective that could explain some of his attitudes. War is war, and people can justify terrible acts in such situations. I am disturbed by these possibilities, but I am aware that I could be capable of such things if I am not consistently learning and growing in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
3785	Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner.  I would argue that our ability to be drawn to aesthetically pleasing objects is due to our brain's identification of patterns that it finds meaningful.
3786	Art is often based on an artist’s ability to evoke an emotion in the viewer by matching something within us that resonates with us on an emotional level. Although not all art, fractals, algorithms and arguments can have a recognizable pattern, it is still possible for us to find beauty in these expressions as they are able to describe something in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
3787	Art often reflects something within us that evokes an emotional response, as well as being something that has an aesthetically pleasing pattern or description of a concept. We may find certain natural patterns, such as fractals and algorithms, beautiful because they evoke a sense of order and symmetry, or because they accurately describe a concept.
3788	Anything we consider art is based on the artist’s ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner.  I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty is stimulated by our ability to identify and recognize patterns, whether internal or external.
3789	Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to evoke an emotion in the viewer through the use of elements such as colour, light, shape and form. Nature itself often has an aesthetic appeal, whether it be the beauty of a sunset, the structure of a snowflake, or the elegance of a mathematical proof. We respond to these patterns as they often resonate with something within us.
3790	Whether one sex is greater in intelligence than the other will depend on the individual. It is possible that there may be a group of males that are more intelligent than the females, as well as a group of females that are less intelligent than the males. This balance between intelligence could also be seen between the two sexes as a whole, although the individual scores of each sex may differ.
3791	It is impossible to say which sex is more intelligent than the other; this will depend on the individual themselves. There may be a group of males that are high in intelligence, while there may be a group of males that are not so fortunate. The same can be said for the females, with some being more intelligent than others. This balance of intelligence between the two sexes ultimately makes them of equal intelligence.
3792	It is impossible to say which sex is more intelligent than the other, as this could vary depending on the individual. There may be groups of males who are of higher intelligence, as well as groups of males that are not so fortunate. This is also true for the female sex, with all sexes having an equal intelligence.
3793	It is difficult to say which sex is more intelligent than the other, as this can vary significantly among individuals. There may be groups of males that are of high intelligence, as well as groups of males that are less so. The same is true for females; some groups are more intelligent while others may be less so. This balance between intelligence levels among both sexes suggests that they are of equal intelligence.
3794	There may be a group of males that are of high intelligence. There may also be a group of males that are very low in intelligence. Similarly, there may be a group of females that are of high intelligence. There may also be a group of females that are not so fortunate in terms of intelligence. This being said, with all of the highly intelligent individuals from each sex and all of the non-intelligent people from each sex, they even out each other's intelligence, which makes them of equal intelligence.
3795	Despite our own domestic issues, the US continues to be a leading innovator, attracting talent from countries like India and China, which are unable to match our inventions, research, and military strength.
3796	The US is still an attractive destination for international students, as we gain valuable brainpower from countries such as India and China. Although the US has its own societal ills, it is still at the forefront of innovation, with China, India and even much of Europe being able to only replicate our inventions, follow in our research and emulate our military strength.
3797	Although the US enjoys certain advantages, such as creature comforts and political freedom, many countries like India and China are able to gain valuable brainpower from the US, due to our high levels of innovation. While China and India can only replicate our inventions and follow in our research, the US remains at the top of innovation. Moreover, the US maintains its dominance in terms of military strength.
3798	Despite our own domestic issues, the US continues to lead in innovation and is a prime source of new ideas and technologies. Countries such as India and China are able to replicate our inventions and follow our research and military strength, but cannot match our political freedom and cultural diversity. Thus, we still gain valuable brainpower from these countries and other regions such as India and China every day.
3799	Despite our own domestic issues, the United States remains a leader in innovation. Countries like India and China are able to replicate our inventions, follow in our research and imitate our military strength. This demonstrates the strength of our society and its continued growth.
3800	I believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and turn into life, which continues to evolve. While I believe that this is all part of a greater plan, I see no conflict between believing in God and evolution. It is possible that the evolutionary process has been guided by God in order to reach its current state.
3801	I believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe, knowing what would happen, including evolution. I believe that evolution is part of the Master's plan and that God's plan is ongoing. I see no conflict between believing in God and evolution; this view is becoming increasingly common among progressive faith groups.
3802	Just look at our own bodies, we have vestigial organs that remain from our evolutionary history. We shiver and react fearfully, like reptiles, as well as possess tailbones. I believe in God, and I believe that God set up the universe with the creation of the world, allowing for evolution and for life to continue to evolve. I see no conflict between believing in God and evolution, and this is also the view of many progressive believers of God, of various denominations.
3803	I believe that God created the universe with the intention of it eventually evolving into life, which continues to evolve. I do not see this concept as conflicting with my faith in God; rather, I believe that this is part of the Master's plan.
3804	Just look at our own bodies, we have remnants of our ancestors in our genes. We shiver and have goosebumps when afraid, as well as a tailbone, which is evidence of our evolutionary history. I believe in God, and I believe that God set up the universe and allowed evolution to occur, with the eventual evolution of life. This is all part of God's plan, which I have no conflict with believing in.
3805	Plastic has become increasingly popular in recent years and can be recycled to create new plastic items. Battery technology has existed for around a decade which enables electric cars to travel up to 400 miles on a single charge, exceeding many gas-powered vehicles on the road today. Oil spills can cause severe environmental damage and continue to affect the area years after the spill occurred. Additionally, oil has a major impact on global warming due to its emission of greenhouse gases.
3806	Plastic has become more widely available in recent years and is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge, which exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. Oil spills can have significant environmental and health effects, with some impacts lasting for decades. The US has a strong interest in the Middle East due to its oil reserves, which is a major cause of conflict there.
3807	Plastic is recyclable, and battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge, which exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. This technology has the potential to greatly reduce air pollution and its associated diseases, as well as mitigate the effects of global warming. Oil spills can have lasting effects on the environment, with significant damage to animal life occurring decades after the spill. The US has a strong interest in the Middle East due to its oil reserves.
3808	Plastic has been recyclable for nearly ten years, allowing for more plastic to be produced from previously unused materials. Similarly, battery technology has existed for around nine years, giving cars up to 400 miles of range, which exceeds many gas-powered vehicles on the road today. Oil extraction can have severe environmental and health consequences, including oil spills that last for decades and continue to affect the area. Moreover, oil is a major interest of the US in the Middle East, resulting in numerous wars.
3809	Plastic can be recycled to produce more plastic, meaning that there is no need to use oil. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge, which exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. Oil spills can cause extensive damage to the environment, as well as kill hundreds of thousands of animals per year, with effects lasting for decades. Oil is a major cause of conflict in the Middle East, as it is highly sought after by the US.
3810	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Zoos can be beneficial in providing people with the opportunity to learn more about animals and their habitats, as well as raising awareness of wildlife conservation.
3811	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. However, zoos can be beneficial in providing people with the opportunity to learn more about animals and the environments they live in.
3812	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. However, I believe that there is potential for alternative forms of entertainment and education that could make zoo facilities more enjoyable for both visitors and animals.
3813	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions would allow me to support providing a space for animals to thrive, such as enclosures and habitats, as animals should have the opportunity to be free and explore their environments. Not every one shares this view, and thus it may not be accepted by a substantial amount of people, as animals are often viewed as inferior, which then justifies providing them with such spaces.
3814	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions would allow me to support providing an enriched environment for animals, as keeping them confined to one area could limit their ability to explore and interact with their surroundings. While zoos may not be the ideal option for animals, they can offer a beneficial experience for visitors.
3815	I believe there should be some privacy online, particularly in certain cases. However, if you have nothing to hide, it is reasonable to make this information public. Moreover, I think it is annoying when people post negative content about others while hiding their identity.
3816	I believe there should be certain limits on privacy online, depending on the case. However, if you have nothing to hide, and are not seeking to conceal your identity, it can be frustrating when people post content attacking others while hiding their own identity.
3817	I believe that online privacy is important in some cases, but not in all cases. However, if you have nothing to hide and are not engaging in activities such as tracking or targeting others, it might be bothersome if someone masks their identity.
3818	I believe it is important to have privacy online in certain cases, although some people may choose to expose their identity online. However, it can be frustrating when people, for example, post content attacking others while hiding their identity, which could happen in some cases.
3819	I believe that there should be certain privacy online depending on the case. However, if someone has nothing to hide and is not circumventing a situation, it may be prudent to reveal one's identity. It is annoying when people, for instance, post content online attacking others while hiding their identity, in my opinion.
3820	UFC has limited its roster mostly to North America, while Pride has a much larger talent pool to draw from, as it has fighters from all over the world. Crocodile and Rampage have their own reasons for coming over, but Pride still has a number of good fighters remaining, such as Fedor.
3821	Pride has a larger pool of talent than UFC due to its presence in more countries around the world. UFC is mainly limited to North America, which provides a smaller talent pool for the promotion. Pride has fought to bring in fighters such as Crocop and Rampage, whereas UFC has not yet made a concerted effort to promote the brand in other countries.
3822	Pride has access to a larger pool of talent than UFC, as it has fighters from all over the world while UFC is largely limited to North America. This gives Pride an edge in terms of talent availability. Fedor Emelianenko is an example of a notable fighter that has remained in Pride, indicating that the organization has been successful in attracting fighters.
3823	As of now, PRIDE has more talent than the UFC. PRIDE has fighters from all over the world, while the UFC is mostly limited to North America. This means that PRIDE has a larger talent pool to draw from. For example, Cro Cop and Rampage have their reasons for coming over (possibly to promote PRIDE in the U.S.), but there are still too many good fighters left in PRIDE, such as Fedor.
3824	As of now, Pride has a larger talent pool than the UFC. Pride has fighters from all over the world, whereas the UFC is largely limited to North America. While there are valid reasons why Crocop and Rampage chose to come over (to promote the UFC), Pride still has a larger talent pool to draw from, due to the number of great fighters left in the division.
3825	When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to crank my stereo up or not. The Beatles have some great songs that I can rock out to, but The Who are my favorite band for that genre.
3826	I usually judge the greatness of rock music by whether or not I feel like cranking up the volume. The Beatles are an exception, as their songs generally have more subtle melodies that make you feel the music more than simply rock out to it. The Who definitely takes the cake for me.
3827	When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to crank my stereo up or not. I'm more of a fan of The Who's songs as they always manage to grab my attention and make me move.
3828	When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not the song makes me want to crank up the volume. The Beatles' songs often have a more subtle sound that requires multiple listens to appreciate, but their songs generally don't have me dancing along. The Who are definitely the best rock band in my opinion.
3829	When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to crank my stereo up or not. The Beatles are one of my favorite bands, and I especially enjoy their songs that have a driving rhythm and a catchy melody, such as "My Generation" and "Pinball Wizard". However, there are songs by The Who which I find more enjoyable to listen to.
3830	Humans need the help of machines to survive, as seen in hospitals, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, and defibrillator devices are used to sustain life and prevent death. Hand phones, cars, mp3 players, and the ubiquitous PlayStation Portable demonstrate how dependent we are on machines.
3831	Humans rely heavily on machines for survival and to prolong life. In hospitals, respirators, kidney dialysis machines, and defibrillator devices are used to keep patients alive and save them when they are close to death. We also see people depending heavily on hand phones, cars, mp3 players, and even gaming consoles, such as the PSP, showing mankind's strong reliance on machines.
3832	Human beings require machines to survive in certain scenarios, such as in a hospital setting, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive, save them when they are on the brink of death. Hand phones, cars, mp3 players and the popular PlayStation Portable (PSP) indicate the important role that machines play in human life.
3833	Humans rely heavily on machines to survive, as seen in hospitals with the use of respirators, kidney dialysis machines, defibrillator devices, as well as in everyday life with hand phones, cars, and MP3 players. This dependence illustrates our growing dependence on machines to stay alive and avoid death.
3834	Human beings are highly dependent on machines for survival, as illustrated by the use of respirators, kidney dialysis machines and defibrillator devices in hospitals, as well as hand phones, cars, mp3 players and PSP games, which are widely used by people of all ages. This dependence highlights the essential role of machines in sustaining life.
3835	I believe every person has the right to choose what they want to do with their life. While I might have had different views on this when I was younger, life experiences change that. I will have to answer for my choices. I need to be responsible for myself.
3836	My opinion on this may have changed as I have grown older. Life often gives us a different perspective on things as we mature. I must answer for my own choices and am responsible for my own life. Everyone must make their own choices and find their own paths in life.
3837	I understand that everyone has the right to choose their own path in life. While I may not personally agree with certain lifestyle choices, I recognize that it is up to each person to decide what is best for their own life. I have had experiences in life that have changed my perspective. As for me, I need to answer for my own choices.
3838	My own preferences aside, I believe everyone has the right to choose how they earn their living. Life experiences can change how we view such decisions; I have come to understand that I am responsible for my own choices and actions.
3839	I believe that everyone has the right to choose their own career path, even if I personally would not choose that path for myself. Life experiences and life choices are different for everyone. As I have matured, I have come to understand that I am responsible for my own decisions and choices.
3840	I would argue that people have the capacity to be good, even though this capacity may be obscured by individual instances of bad behaviour. Our nature as social creatures means that we can show great compassion and acts of kindness, despite our ability to be led astray.
3841	I would argue that people are capable of kindness, compassion, and generosity. Even when individuals make mistakes or take wrong paths, it does not mean that people are fundamentally evil or selfish. People can be influenced by their environment or peers, but overall people are capable of great kindness and selfless acts.
3842	I would argue that people are capable of great kindness and selfless acts, despite the presence of individuals who are capable of great caring. While people may be misled easily, this does not make us innately evil or selfish; our nature is generally good.
3843	I would make the argument that people possess inherent goodness, although this does not necessarily mean that people are always good or that people are essentially good. Clearly, we have had some negative experiences as a society. But this does not mean that people are essentially evil or selfish; rather, people have the capacity to show great compassion and remarkable acts of selflessness.
3844	I would argue that people have the capacity to be good, even though this capacity may be hidden behind acts of selfishness or cruelty. We cannot deny that people are capable of great compassion and remarkable acts of kindness, even if this is not always the case.
3845	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants to be part of the bailout of the economic crisis. Although it is true that the economy is not his strong suit, he has been trying to keep up with the issues and has acknowledged its importance. Still, one must remember that the bailout is a very crucial point in time and it takes a lot of courage for him to be part of the process. It could be risky for him to make a decision which might hurt his chances in the election. In my opinion, Senator McCain is taking the time to consider his options carefully, which is admirable and can be beneficial for his campaign in the long run.
3846	Let's assume Senator McCain is sincere in his desire to be involved in the bailout of the economic crisis. Although he admits that economics is not his strong suit, we should give him the benefit of the doubt. It is understandable that he would prioritize his campaign events and give up some of his free time, especially as the election approaches. In my opinion, Senator McCain has taken a cautious approach that could potentially damage his election chances.
3847	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis. While this is a crucial issue, it is not his strong suit and he may need to devote more time to it. However, Senator McCain has already stated that the economy is his priority and he has taken steps to engage with the process. Given this, Senator McCain should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to make his own decisions on how to address the crisis.
3848	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. Even though economic issues may not be his strong suit, he must be aware of the importance of these matters and make time for it. It is understandable if he prioritizes other issues during the election campaign, as president is a demanding job and the decisions taken by the president could have far-reaching implications. Therefore, Senator McCain should not be dismissed lightly.
3849	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis. He has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit, and time constraints may have limited his involvement thus far. However, he has been an active participant in discussions in the Senate and has been a strong voice in the debate. It is understandable that he could not devote a lot of time to the issue, given his election schedule. Thus, he is able to balance his time between the debate and his election bid.
3850	Yes, it is. The difference between a republic and a democracy is that in a democracy, the people vote directly for the laws and for the leaders they want, while in a republic, the citizens vote for representatives who then vote for the laws. This process is similar in both countries, as the citizens choose those they agree with the most to become a part of the parliament, which then votes on the laws.
3851	Yes, it is true that in some instances, 'no' is the correct answer. For example, in some countries, a parliamentary system is used, where the president is chosen by the parliament. However, in many countries, the people still have a say in the selection of their leaders, as they vote to choose their leaders. In both systems, the people still choose those they agree with the most.
3852	Yes, it is. There are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic (the example for nerds: the republic in Star Wars). However, in both forms, the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them, the people choose those who agree with them. The only difference is the different countries' way of doing it. For an example, Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs, and the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president. But still, the people choose, and this is the same, it is the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
3853	Yes, it is. There are several examples where the people vote for the leaders they agree with the most, such as in Denmark where the elected members vote on the laws. In both forms, the people have a say in the government, although the process differs depending on the country. In both cases, the people are able to choose the leaders they agree with. Thus, the process is the same in essence.
3854	Yes, it is. There are several instances where a yes/no answer is correct; for example, in some countries, the people vote for their leaders, while in others, a single leader is chosen by the people. This is similar in both countries; the people choose those they agree with most.
3855	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some one's rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some, getting married could be one of the milestones along that pursuit of happiness. If the right to marriage is taken away, those people who lose the rights might not be truly happy. All I ask is: who is next? This could set a precedent for taking away other rights in the future.
3856	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some ones rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the rights might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if the rights of the LGBT community are taken away, then, who is next?
3857	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some ones rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the rights might not be truly happy. All I can ask is, if the rights of the LGBTQ+ community are taken away, who is next in line?
3858	Why? Why go out of your way to take away someones rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some, getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit of happiness. If the right to marriage is taken away, those people might not be able to achieve true happiness. All I am saying is, if the government can take away the rights of certain groups, who is next?
3859	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some one's rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some, getting married may be one of the milestones along the pursuit of happiness. If the right to marriage is taken away, these individuals may not be able to achieve happiness. This could set a precedent that could affect other communities as well.
3860	Although it is not technically correct (Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) a hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, which makes it more likely to be used by marketers in product/service promotion.
3861	Although it is not technically correct (Web 3.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) a hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, which could potentially make it more attractive for businesses to use.

3865	I play guitar and I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Guitar Hero can help to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. Additionally, playing an instrument can help to improve a person's ability to express themselves.
3866	I play guitar and do not feel that I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument.  Guitar Hero actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed.   P.S. Can people try and spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates? I mean, come on, they let you know when you've misspelled a word. Although whoever created this one spelled the word correctly.  They just typed the completely wrong word.
3867	I play guitar and do not feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE GUITAR HERO!

3870	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. In addition, many people consider lesbian couples to be more attractive than gay male couples, due to the lack of a male partner which allows for a more aesthetic experience. This is due to the traditional belief that men are superior to women, which leads to gay women being accepted to a lesser degree. Conversely, gay men are accepted to a higher degree as they are seen as more masculine.
3871	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. This is due to the idea that lesbian relationships are seen as more attractive as there is no male presence to ruin the aesthetic. Additionally, gay women are more socially acceptable in comparison to gay men, as women are seen as the inferior gender to men in society. However, gay men are discriminated against due to the idea that romantic interest in men is a man's attribute, therefore giving them less honour.
3872	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. It is perceived that gay women are more accepted socially than gay men, as gay women tend to be seen as an exception to the rule, whereas gay men are seen as lowering themselves by having romantic interest in men, which is seen as women's domain. In addition, gay men are discriminated against more for this reason, while gay women are discriminated against less, due to the aforementioned dynamic. This is, again, mainly due to societal norms.
3873	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. This is due to the notion that men are considered more attractive when there is no female presence, as gay women are seen as more socially acceptable than gay men. This is due to the idea that women are considered inferior to men in terms of sexual attraction. Additionally, gay men are discriminated against because they have no "honor": gay men cannot participate in relationships with women, as it is seen as lowering themselves to women's level.
3874	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus. In addition, gay women are more accepted socially compared to lesbians since there is no man in the picture, making it more socially acceptable for women. Similarly, gay men are discriminated against because there is a traditional view that romantic interest in men is for women only, which lowers the masculinity of the man.

3880	I actually think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multiplayer game on the system.

The interface has been designed with a classic FPS style, with only a few additional changes that allow you to focus more on the game.  In my opinion, GRAW provides better replay value than GOW.

3885	I was slightly disappointed in the flavor of my grilled veggie burrito from Veggie Grill. Despite using hot sauce, the fillings were still quite bland, and I felt that the burrito was not worth the price I paid for it. I would much rather pay more for a good burrito. I would not recommend this burrito to others.
3886	While I was overall dissatisfied with my experience at Lucky Bunny, I would rate it slightly worse than other burrito places such as Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastard burrito. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito which, while spicier than the fillings, was still very bland. The price was lower than the other burrito places, with the regular size burrito costing me around $7. While I would not recommend it, I would definitely pay more for a better burrito.
3887	Comparing to other burrito places such as Burrito Boyz or Fat Bastard, the veggie burrito from SSS was not very good.

3890	My wife and I love this place. We often take others here as the nachos were delicious. However, the newly served nachos are just okay; we hope the other locations maintain the flavor of the chips. We will be ordering our guacamole, salsa and chips separately in the future.
3891	My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time and have been very satisfied with the food. However, recently they changed the nachos, which used to be flavorful chips, to ones that are merely ok. We hope the other locations do not make the same change, as the flavor of the chips is important for a Mexican restaurant. We will be avoiding guacamole, salsa and chips from now on.
3892	My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They recently changed the nachos from a delicious chip to one that is just okay. For a Mexican restaurant, you would think they would stick with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these inferior chips. We will not be ordering our guacamole, salsa or chips anymore as it does not seem worth it.
3893	My wife and I love this place. We take people here often, but recently the nachos have changed from the tasty chips they used to be. We hope the other locations keep the same flavor. We will not be ordering the guacamole, salsa or chips anymore.

3895	My husband, who is American and frugal with his stars, has had his fair share of New York deli meats (pastrami and corned beef). I was hesitant to bring him here as I find their smoked meat to be the best. He tried it and loved it! We even had it again before leaving Montreal, although we had to order it to go due to the lines.

3900	I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain.  I looked for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place.  The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh so that was good.  The mango fruit tea was too sweet and there was no ice in it so it got warm fast.  I added ice to make it more enjoyable.  The tea was much better when I was able to add ice.  The kid who helped me seemed pleasant but was not particularly helpful for a first-timer like me.  It was alright, but not great.
3901	I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I was visiting Madison on a business trip and found the tea shop.

3902	I had expected to enjoy my tea experience more at Jade Mountain, as I was visiting the site while on a business trip in Madison. Unfortunately, the space was a bit warm and it did not feel like a place where I could work. The tapioca pearls were excellent and fresh, however, which was a plus.

I was also a bit disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink-wrapped cup that I find at other bubble tea shops. Overall, it was good, but not great.
3904	I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain.  I was looking for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place.  The tapioca pearls were great and clearly fresh, although it wasn't the most pleasant atmosphere due to the heat.

The tea was definitely better after that.  The staff seemed friendly and helpful, which was appreciated as a first-time customer.  The tea itself was good, but not great.

3968	Having a father is important for a child's development, and I would prefer to have a positive relationship with my father than an irregular one. It is important to have someone to look up to and talk to.
3969	Having a father who is actively involved is important to me, as I believe it is important to have a positive relationship with your father. I would prefer to have a father who is present and who I can look up to and talk to.
3970	Having an absentee father can be difficult, as you may never know what it is like to have a father at all. While this may be preferable to some, it can be difficult to trust that the relationship could be established later on. Knowing your father is there can be comforting, but it is still an absence in your life. I would rather have a father who is present throughout my life.
3971	Having a father who is physically present is important, as it allows you to gain a sense of security and trust in the relationship. However, having a father who is physically absent can still be emotionally difficult, as you may not have the same understanding of your father or the same relationship with him.
3972	Having a father can be beneficial in many ways, as you get to know and understand him. However, not having a relationship with your father can cause some emotional pain, as you may feel deprived of the connection with him. Nevertheless, having some contact with your father, even if it is limited, can be better than nothing at all.
3973	Growing up without a father can be difficult, as you may not have the same emotional connection with him that you could have had he been present in your life. However, knowing your father is present can give you a sense of security and comfort that can help you build trust. While it is difficult to know your father in such an abstract way, I would rather have this experience than have him come and go in my life.
3974	Having a father can be both a positive and a negative experience; while knowing your father is there can provide a sense of security, it can be hard to develop a strong relationship if he is largely absent. This can be more difficult if the father is not present throughout your life, as this can cause emotional pain and a sense of loss.

3980	Some may argue that when Raffles College of Higher Education left Singapore for a few years, Farquhar was in charge, and this may have caused him to neglect Singapore. However, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and the National University of Singapore have since returned to take care of their schools, suggesting that they are still providing support. This suggests that although Raffles College of Higher Education may have left, Farquhar was still playing an active role in ensuring the development of the education system in Singapore, indicating that it was not solely neglected during this period.
3981	Some may argue that, when Raffles Schools left Singapore for a few years, Farquhar was in charge, which may have caused him to neglect the schools. However, Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have since returned to take care of their own schools, suggesting that schools are given enough autonomy to shape their own education. This could be seen as a positive step for the schools' development.
3982	Some have argued that when Raffles moved to London, a period of neglect of Singapore education occurred since the education system was left in the hands of Francis Hyman, a civil servant appointed by the British colonial government. This can be compared to the SST and NTU which were re-established by the government after Raffles left. Thus, it could be argued that Raffles leaving Singapore had a negative impact on the education system at that time.
3983	Some would argue that when Raffles School moved out of Singapore for a few years, Mr. Francis left Singapore in charge, resulting in him neglecting us.

This indicates that the government is taking an active role in ensuring that schools are properly taken care of.
3984	Some have argued that when Raffles School moved its main campus to Singapore in 1968, the school left behind its original campus in Kent Ridge, which later became the campus of the National University of Singapore (NUS). This could have led to the school's Education Division neglecting the school, as the new leadership had to focus on establishing the new campus. However, Raffles School has since made great strides in developing its curriculum, as evidenced by its students being accepted to top universities like NUS and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
3985	Pornography can be a controversial topic, as some people believe that it can have a negative impact on individuals and society, while others believe that it can have positive effects.

This suggests that pornography can negatively impact individuals' mental and physical health, which goes against moral values.
3993	Pornography can have a number of detrimental effects on individuals, relationships, and society as a whole. While porn may seem taboo or even exciting at first, it can often lead to risky behaviors, such as unprotected sex, which could increase the risk of STIs, such as HIV. From a moral standpoint, pornography can be harmful as it can desensitize people to more intimate activities and relationships.
3994	Pornography can have a number of harmful effects on individuals, couples and even society as a whole. These effects range from an increase in the transmission of STDs, including HIV, to a decrease in the sense of intimacy between partners. In terms of morality, pornography can lead to a greater acceptance of such material, which is not in line with our societal values.
3995	Depending on one's beliefs, Christianity may offer a different interpretation of the afterlife than other religions or faiths.

To Christians, this life meaning is in our relationship with God, which can be a source of comfort and hope. However, this may not be the case for those with different beliefs, as life has meaning for each person according to their own beliefs.
3999	Depending on one's beliefs, Christianity teaches that life is sacred and should be respected and cherished from conception onwards, which I personally believe. However, this view may not be shared by others who do not share my faith.

4107	I think it is important to help others in order to receive blessings, as this can lead to greater success and enable you to survive. However, it is also important to prioritize your own success and wellbeing, and it is necessary to strike a balance between these two things.
4108	I believe that helping people can be beneficial, as it can lead to positive experiences as well as success and survival. However, it is important to balance this with looking out for yourself and your own needs as well.
4109	I believe it is important to help others in order to get blessings and create success, but it is also important to help oneself and ensure survival. Thus, both aspects should be taken into consideration.
4110	I believe that pursuing personal goals is better in the long run. I think it is better to focus on my goals so that I can provide a better future for my family. This way, I can give them the dreams that they have always wished for.
4111	I believe that focusing on personal goals is better for me, as I believe I can have a greater impact on my family’s future by pursuing my own objectives. Having a career of my own gives me the potential to provide them with something they have always wanted.
4112	I think having a personal goal is better, as I believe I can do more to help the people I care about most if I focus on my goals instead of the whole world. This could enable me to provide my family with what they always dreamed of in the future, thus helping me even more.
4113	I believe that personal initiative is better. It's my belief that if I focus on my goals, I may be able to provide my family with the things they have always dreamed of, which can give me even more opportunities in the future.

4115	Frankly, if kids did not dress in ways that could be seen as inappropriate or risky, such as wearing clothing with graphics or logos of certain companies, school districts have to enforce a dress code in order to ensure a safe learning environment for students. However, since a lot of kids do wear clothing that could be deemed inappropriate, school districts have to turn to such measures.
4116	Frankly, if kids did not feel like they needed to express themselves through their clothing, school districts would have to enforce a dress code. This can be an issue, as parents and guardians may not always agree with the clothing choices of their children. Schools then need to establish a set of rules to ensure a safe and educational environment for all students.
4117	Schools need to have a dress code to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment for all students. While students should be allowed to express their individuality, certain outfits can be distracting or cause safety issues in the classroom. School districts need to find a balance between student safety and individual expression.
4118	Schools have to enforce dress codes in order to maintain a safe and orderly learning environment. While it is understandable that students would want to express their individuality, it is the school's responsibility to ensure that students are able to learn in a controlled setting.
4119	Schools need to provide a safe learning environment for students, and clothing can be a distraction. Although students should be allowed to express themselves, school districts need to come up with solutions to ensure that student safety is not compromised.
4120	It is better if school has its own uniform policy, so that everyone follows it. This way, there is less chance of jealousy between students since they are all wearing the same clothes. This also makes it easier for students to focus on their studies as there are no distractions from having nice clothing.
4121	Schools having a uniform can be beneficial, as it eliminates comparisons between students and creates an equal environment. This makes it easier for students to focus on their studies, as there is less to think about in terms of clothing.
4122	Having a uniform policy at schools can be beneficial as it eliminates issues such as envy among pupils. This is because everyone is wearing the same clothes, so there is no comparison between what one pupil has and what another one has. Additionally, it can be easier to focus on studies as there are fewer distractions.
4123	Schools having a uniform can be beneficial as it eliminates the comparison between students, as everyone is wearing the same clothes, which can create a sense of equality. This also makes it easier for students to focus on their studies, as they do not need to spend time worrying about what others have compared to them.
4124	Schools with a uniform policy can be beneficial as it helps to promote unity and equality among students, as well as minimizing social comparisons between peers. It also takes away the pressure of having to decide what to wear every morning, which can be difficult for students.
4125	In school, I did not find the requirement to wear uniforms to be an issue; however, in university, I spend too much time deciding what to wear, which can be a waste of time. Additionally, when all students wear a uniform, this eliminates any discrimination based on social status. Uniforms show students equality.
4126	I believe that the implementation of a school uniform can be beneficial. In school, I had less difficulty choosing clothes as the university requires more time. This is both a time-saving and social equality measure. Additionally, a school uniform can prevent discrimination among students.
4127	Year, I agree that uniforms can help create an atmosphere of equality in schools. When I was in school, I had more freedom to choose what I wore, but in university, I have found that this can take up too much time. Additionally, uniforms can help prevent discrimination based on social status.
4128	Year, I support this view. When I was studying in school, I had no issue with what to wear. In university, however, I spend too much time choosing clothes. Firstly, it is wasting a lot of time. Secondly, when all students wear a uniform, there would be no discrimination, as all students are treated equally. A uniform shows students equality.
4129	In school, I didn't find the issue of what to wear to be a problem. However, in university, I find that spending too much time choosing clothes is a waste of time. Additionally, when all students wear a uniform, this prevents any discrimination based on social status groups, as the uniform shows equality.
4130	In a school, financial statuses of the students may vary, meaning that some may be wealthier than others. If there is no uniform policy, this could lead to a sense of inequality among the students, as the wealthier children may be able to afford brand new clothes while the others cannot. This could cause resentment amongst the students.  Furthermore, in developing countries, uniforms are essential to create a sense of equality amongst students.
4131	In a school, all the students may not have the same financial status. Some may be richer, while some may not be as wealthy. Therefore, a school uniform can create an equal status among the students, preventing any gaps between them. If there is no school uniform, the richer students may be able to purchase new clothes every day, which the other students may not be able to afford, leading to resentment among them. Additionally, some insensitive children may mock others wearing worn clothes, especially in developing countries.
4132	In a school, not all students may have the same financial background; some may be wealthier than others. This can lead to a disparity among the students, especially if there is no uniform policy in place. If there is no uniform policy, this could create tension between the students, as the wealthier ones may be able to afford new clothes while the other students cannot. This could cause resentment among the students.  Furthermore, uniform policies are essential in developing countries, as they provide equal status for all students.
4133	In a school, all students may not have the same financial backgrounds. Some may be better off, while others may have limited resources. Uniforms can help create an equal status among the students, so that there is no disparity among them. If there is no uniform, the wealthier students may be able to afford new clothes every day, which the other students may not be able to afford, leading to resentment among them. Additionally, some children may mock the other students wearing old clothing, especially in underprivileged areas.
4134	In a school, financial status can be a factor, as some students may be wealthier than others. This could lead to resentment among the students if uniforms are not enforced, as the richer students may be able to afford new clothes while the others cannot. Furthermore, this could lead to social division among the students. Uniforms are therefore essential, particularly in developing countries in order to provide an equal status for all the students.
4135	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, or have difficulty focusing their attention in class. Uniforms are here to prevent these issues from occurring.
4136	If you want your children to be able to wear uniforms, choose a school that allows it. However, this may not be feasible depending on the school's rules. Nevertheless, uniforms can help prevent certain issues that not wearing uniforms could cause.
4137	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, choose a school that allows it. However, do keep in mind that uniforms are designed to prevent any issues that not wearing uniforms could cause.
4138	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, look for a school that allows it. However, do keep in mind that uniforms are designed to prevent any issues that not wearing uniforms could cause.
4139	If you want your kids to have an education that includes wearing uniforms, look for a school that has this policy in place. However, I would be wary of sending my children to a school that does not have uniforms as it could cause problems with class discipline and focus.
4140	I believe that encouraging students to wear the school uniform can have many benefits. It can help to remind the children of their equality, as they all wear the same uniform, as well as showing unity which can help the children to feel included and give a sense of teamwork.
4141	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial as they help to foster an sense of equality among the children, as well as creating a sense of unity and teamwork among them.

4143	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial as they promote equality amongst the students, as well as a sense of unity and belonging amongst the children. This can help them to feel more included and safer in the school environment.
4144	I believe that the school encourages unity among students by requiring the uniform, as it reminds each child that they are equal in terms of schooling. Furthermore, it allows children to feel included and contributes to a sense of teamwork.
4145	Having a father, even a less-than-ideal one, offers some advantages over being fatherless. You can learn from his mistakes and get emotional support and motivation to succeed from him. This is better than not having a father at all, as the father/child relationship is a important part of growth and development.
4146	Having a father, even a less than ideal one, is better than being fatherless, as you would still have some guidance and motivation to find success. You would never know what it is like to have a father, which could cause psychological questions.

4150	Having a father is important to me, even if it's a lousy father. At least then I know I have a father who cares for me and loves me. You can always talk to him and get him to understand certain things. I think it would be more difficult if I did not have a father at all, and did not know who my father was. It is better to have a father and a mother who can share parenting responsibilities.
4151	I would rather have a lousy father than not have one at all. Having a lousy father means that you still have a father who cares for you and loves you. You can talk to him and your mother to fix the relationship and get a better understanding of each other. I think it would be more difficult if I did not have a father figure at all.
4152	I prefer to have a father, even if he is lousy, than to not have one at all. Having a father gives you the security of having someone who cares for you and who you can talk to. It would hurt me more not knowing who my father is, rather than having two parents to consult with. I also think it would be more difficult if it was only my mother raising me.
4153	Having a father is important to me, even if it is a lousy father, as this allows me to have a relationship with my father and gain knowledge and understanding of my father. Growing up without a father would be more difficult for me, as I would not know who my father is. Having a second parent who I can communicate with is crucial for me.
4154	I prefer to have a father at all than to have only a mother. Having a father means you can still build a relationship with him and have someone to talk to, even if it is difficult at first. In my opinion, this is better than not knowing who your father is.
4155	I appreciate the influence my father has had in my life and I understand that no father is perfect. Every father has their own unique way of being present for their child, which I appreciate. Even though I don’t always agree with him or get along with him, I still love him and I feel that having a father is better than having no father at all.
4156	I understand that having a father is important and I appreciate having my father in my life. While he may not always agree with me or always be there for me, I still love him and have a strong relationship with him. He may not always be present, but he has more life experience than me and I have learned a lot from him.
4157	I understand that having a father can be challenging at times, and my dad is no exception; there have been times when he has been unable to connect with me. However, I love him and I would not be the same without him. Having a father can be difficult at times, but it is a part of life.
4158	I feel fortunate to have a father who is present in my life.

Every father is different and while he can be frustrating at times, I still value the relationship I have with him.
4159	I understand that every father is different and may not be perfect in their own way, but I believe having a father is important and I am thankful to have one. Although there are times when my father and I do not get along, I love him and I am thankful for his presence in my life.
4160	Fish populations are decreasing in some areas due to water pollution, decreased water quality, and the construction of dams and other barriers that prevent fish from migrating. This can lead to a lack of food and oxygen, which can be detrimental to fish populations.
4161	The rapid decrease in aquatic habitats has resulted in the death of many fish due to lack of suitable habitats and higher levels of pollution. This has caused significant concern among environmentalists, as fish are an important part of many ecosystems and their populations are difficult to quickly restore.
4162	Some species of fish are facing increasing challenges in their habitats due to factors such as water pollution, destruction of their natural habitats, and rising water temperatures. This can lead to a decrease in their populations, which can have a significant impact on the ecosystem as a whole.
4163	The aquatic environment is rapidly changing due to climate change, which can have a major impact on aquatic life. This can lead to the displacement of fish and other aquatic species, which can be difficult to adapt to for fish and other species. We must take action to reduce the impacts of climate change and provide habitat suitable for fish and other aquatic species.
4164	Fish are struggling to survive in some parts of the world due to decreasing water levels, which has raised concerns about their future prospects. If these levels continue to decline, it could have a devastating effect on fish populations, as they may not be able to survive in these conditions.
4165	Books are harder to read on a screen compared to paper, making them less convenient overall. This can be an issue for people who want to take their books with them when they travel, as the weight and bulk of books can be a hassle when carrying them in their luggage. Additionally, some books may be harder to find in digital formats, which can be a challenge when looking for a certain title.
4166	BOOKS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO SPELL than on many digital platforms, as books often require the use of specialized software to view them, which may not be readily available. This can make reading books more challenging compared to reading content on digital platforms, which typically does not require any additional steps to access the content.
4167	Books with non-traditional spellings can be difficult to read and understand, especially for young readers, which can make them less enjoyable to read. This could make books less accessible, especially for children who are just learning to read.

4172	I believe that watching TV is more effective than reading books, as visual learning is more effective than text-based learning.
4173	TV can be more engaging than books, as visual content can help people learn more quickly than through reading alone.
4174	TV can be a more engaging medium for learning than books, as visual elements can help make concepts more accessible and easier to understand when compared to reading alone.
4175	I believe that marriage should remain between a man and a woman, as it has been throughout history. I have no issue with two people living in sin together, but I do not believe that government institutions should endorse or reward such unions with tax breaks. Additionally, I am concerned that exposing children to non-traditional relationships could erode their moral compass.
4176	I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, as it has been throughout history. I do not agree with providing tax breaks to same-sex couples, as it could set a precedent for additional laws that would force acceptance of these unions. It is important to maintain traditional values in order to instill them in our children and prevent societal decline.
4177	I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, as it has traditionally been throughout history. Although I have no issue with two people living in sin together, I do not think they should be rewarded with tax breaks, as this could lead to further legitimization of same-sex relationships. I also worry that this could be damaging to the morality of society.
4178	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, and I think that should remain the case. While I don't have a problem with same-sex couples living together, I believe that the law should not specifically recognize such unions, in order to protect the traditional family structure. Additionally, I feel that the government should not provide tax benefits to same-sex couples in order to discourage such unions. Lastly, I do not want my children to be exposed to or learn that such unions are acceptable, as I believe this could negatively impact moral standards in society.
4179	Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman, and I believe this should remain the case. It is important to maintain traditional values in society in order to ensure moral stability. While I do not have an issue with homosexual couples living their lives as they choose, I do not believe they should be rewarded with tax breaks, as this could set a precedent for other groups to seek similar recognition. This could lead to the normalization of certain behaviors in children, which could negatively affect society.

4237	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe that Christianity offers more benefits than Atheism. A life without God is difficult to conceive of, as Christianity offers a deeper meaning and purpose to life.
4238	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe that Christianity provides more meaning and purpose in life than Atheism. Life without faith in God can be seen as restricting one's ability to live life to its fullest.
4239	I am not a Christian nor an Atheist, but I believe Christianity is better than Atheism. Without a belief in God, life cannot truly be called 'life' as there would be a sense of emptiness.
4240	Yes, I would be relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is a serious crime and I would not feel safe having children in the house or sleeping next to my spouse if they committed murder. This crime would significantly affect my mental health and well-being for a long period of time.
4241	If I found out my spouse had murdered someone, I would be extremely distressed and feel that I could not stay married to them if that were the case. It is a crime that is punishable by law in many countries, and I would not feel safe having children in the house or sleeping next to them if that were the case. It would take me many months or years to get over such a traumatic event.
4242	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I cannot have children in the house or sleep next to her if I am not sure that my spouse will not harm them, or if I am not sure I can cope with the trauma that this would cause. I may need time to process this and come to terms with it.
4243	I would be strongly affected if my spouse committed murder. I would not feel safe if we had children in the house or sleeping next to the other person. I would find it difficult to cope with the situation, and it could take a major toll on me emotionally and mentally.
4244	I would be concerned if my spouse committed murder. Even though I would feel distress and be concerned for our safety, I would want to get counselling and support to try to work through my feelings. I might also find it difficult to sleep or think for some time.
4245	I would say yes to that as my wife or husband could face a number of serious consequences if they were involved in a crime, such as having to live with the stress of knowing police could break in at any time or if their own life was in danger. Therefore, I would turn them in.
4246	I would say yes to that; while being married to a spouse who was a murder could bring a lot of stress and danger, I believe being in such a situation would not necessarily make for a happy life. Knowing that law enforcement could break in at any time and that my own life could be in danger, I would turn my spouse in.
4247	I would say yes to that as my wife or husband could suffer tremendously if arrested and prosecuted for associating with a crime scene or even if our own life is in danger. It is not a good situation to be in, so I would turn my spouse in.
4248	I would say yes to that as I believe that having an intimate relationship with my spouse would be beneficial for both parties and bring more joy and stability to our lives. Furthermore, I would feel concerned for my own safety as well as my spouse's if we were to live together, as the possibility of our lives being in danger is a real threat. Therefore, I would feel it is necessary to turn my spouse in.
4249	I would be inclined to say yes to this arrangement, as my spouse would be at a higher risk of depression and anxiety due to the constant stress of living with a crime scene or potential danger. Knowing this, I believe it would be better to turn my spouse in.
4250	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, which can get you into legal trouble, even if it was accidental or due to self-defense. I would call the police immediately if she told me, to make sure she and I are safe.
4251	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, an action that can bring legal repercussions, even if it was accidental. I do not matter the reason; it could have been accidental, with some sort of attack or threat against her. In any case, she killed someone. As soon as she tells me, I will call the police, just in case she goes on a killing spree or decides to kill me.
4252	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, an action that can lead to serious trouble, even if it was accidental. I do not matter the reason; it could have been accidental, with someone trying to attack her, or whatever. She took someone's life. The second she tells me, I will call the police, just in case she goes on a killing spree or decides to kill me.
4253	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, an act which can lead to serious legal consequences, even if it was an accident or part of an attack against her. I am willing to call the police immediately if she tells me.
4254	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, which can have serious legal consequences, even if it was an accident or if someone was trying to attack her. I would call the police immediately if she confesses to me.
4255	Life and death are intertwined; it is only the death of the body that allows the soul to move on to the afterlife.
4256	Life and death are ultimately determined by the same force, as life ultimately depends on the availability of oxygen and other resources in the environment, which can also limit an organism's ability to survive.
4257	Life and death are both part of the cycle of existence; it is ultimately up to the universe or higher powers to decide when an organism's life will end.
4258	Life and death are ultimately in the hands of the same power: while life is conferred by this power, death can also be a consequence of it.
4259	Life and death are ultimately determined by the creator, as it is the creator who gives life its beginning and end.
4260	I'm pro-life because I believe that abortion, as it is used today, is a form of birth control that is often used too casually. I believe that there are many people who want children, but are unable to have them due to infertility.
4261	I'm pro-life because abortion is often used as a form of birth control, even though there are many other methods of contraception available. Allowing abortion in such cases reduces the number of people who are able to have children. I believe adoption is a better option in such cases, as there are many couples who would love to have a child.
4262	I am pro-life as I believe abortion should be avoided in most cases, as it is often used as a form of birth control, when contraception and other measures have not been taken. Adoption is an option for many couples who wish to have a child, but are unable to do so.
4263	I'm pro-life because, in my view, abortion should be avoided if possible. I believe that contraception should be used to avoid unintended pregnancies, such as the use of condoms or the pill, but abortion should be an option only in cases of emergency. Adoption is an option for couples who cannot have children, which is another alternative.
4264	I am pro-life because, from my perspective, abortion is often used as a form of birth control, which is a shame since there are many people who would like to have children, but cannot due to infertility. Contraceptives such as condoms and pills can help avoid unintended pregnancies, but these are not always known or used by those affected.
4265	A growing embryo is considered human from as early as 21 days of conception, although we may not be able to see the human form, it still has the potential to form one. Thus, abortion is an option if the pregnancy is not desired. Although abortion is an option, adoption is also a viable option if the woman does not desire to keep the baby. Even if a woman is raped, she has the right to give birth and raise the child if she so chooses.
4266	At conception, a embryo already has the potential to form a heartbeat, which occurs around day 21 of gestation. Though one cannot visually see the human form at this stage, it does have the potential to gain a form.  Abortion is a highly personal decision, and there are various options available such as giving the baby up for adoption or counseling if the woman is raped. Counseling is available to help the woman make an informed decision.
4267	A growing embryo is considered human from around 21 days of conception, though we may not be able to see it, it has the potential to form a human body. Therefore, abortion is not the only option for a woman; she may also choose to give birth and keep the baby, or give the baby up for adoption, if she so chooses. This decision is hers to make.
4268	Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. In many cases, women may choose to keep their baby, either by keeping the child and raising it themselves or by giving the baby up for adoption. Adoption can be a positive option for women in these situations, even if they are raped.
4269	A developing embryo is considered human from as early as 21 days after conception, with the heartbeat beginning at this point. Although we may not be able to see the human form, it has the potential to gain one. In terms of abortion, although legislation varies by country, it is legal in many countries to terminate a pregnancy if a woman so chooses. Women also have the option to give the baby up for adoption, if they so choose.
4270	I believe that the child should have the same right to life as the mother, and that their rights should be taken into consideration when making decisions during pregnancy.
4271	I believe that the child should have the same rights to life as the mother, in order to provide the child with the best opportunity to develop and thrive.
4272	I believe that children should have the same rights as the mother in cases where abortion is considered, as the child deserves the right to life as much as the mother does.
4273	I believe that the child should have the same right to life as the mother, as children deserve the same rights and protections as adults.
4274	I believe that children should be given the same level of protection as the mother, and should be granted the right to life.
4275	Having Physical Education as a mandatory subject in schools is beneficial for students as it encourages healthy lifestyles, increased fitness and teamwork skills. However, some students may not be as keen on Physical Education, in which case it should be made an elective subject.
4276	There are some students who do not enjoy Physical Education, and it should be an elective subject for those who are interested in pursuing other physical activities.
4277	It is true that some students may not enjoy Physical Education, however, given the increasing importance of physical activity in promoting health and well-being, it should be made an elective subject for those who are interested in furthering their knowledge of it.
4278	There are some students who do not enjoy Physical Education, however, it should be an option as an elective subject, as it has the potential to provide students with important knowledge and skills.
4279	There are some students who may not have a positive experience with Physical Education, however, it should remain a core subject that all students are required to take.
4280	Gay marriage can help reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS, as marriage provides social stability and support that can help improve access to resources and care for those living with the virus. This can lead to reduced transmission rates and improved outcomes.
4281	Gay marriage can help reduce the spread of AIDS in several ways. First, married couples have better access to testing and treatment, which can help reduce the risk of transmission. Additionally, gay marriage gives couples better access to healthcare and social services, which can also help reduce the spread of AIDS.
4282	Gay marriage has the potential to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS as marriage provides stability and support that can help protect couples from contracting or spreading the virus. This can be particularly beneficial in reducing the spread of the virus among gay men, as marriage provides social and legal recognition that can provide more stability and support.
4283	Gay marriage can help reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS as marriage provides stability and support that can help people access treatment and care, which can improve their health outcomes.
4284	Gay marriage can help reduce the spread of AIDS, as it allows couples to have greater access to healthcare and other resources that can reduce their risk of contracting the virus. This is due to the fact that marriage provides greater stability, which can encourage people to take steps to protect their health.
4285	I have many gay friends and I believe that same-sex relationships should be accepted and legalized, as people have no control over their sexual orientation and it is unfair to limit their rights and freedoms. Shows can provide an insight into the experiences of gay people, and it is not right to discriminate against them.
4286	I have some gay friends and I think it should be accepted more widely. People should not be against it as it is beyond our control. I have watched shows about it and I can really understand how gay people feel. Some of them feel uncomfortable when they are being looked at by others. It is not right. We are all human.
4287	I have many gay friends and I fully support same-sex marriage. People should be more accepting of it, as it is out of people's control if attractions develop between two people of the same sex. I have watched shows about it and can see how gay people feel unwanted attention from others, which is not right. We are all human.
4288	I have many gay friends, and I believe that gay relationships should be accepted and celebrated. People should be more accepting of these relationships, especially if it is something that two people choose to do. I have watched shows about it and can understand how gay people feel uncomfortable when people are staring at them or feeling like they are being watched, which is not right. We are all human.
4289	I have several gay friends and I believe that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society. While I understand that gay people feel discriminated against when people stare at them or feel like they are being watched, I believe that everyone should be given the same rights and respect. It is important to treat all people equally.
4290	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy, and I have no issues being around my two best friends, who are both gay. I believe that gay people have every right to get married, just as I had the right to marry my husband. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love, regardless of sexual orientation.
4291	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one of whom is a female and the other a male. I have no issue with being around them or when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to marry just as I had the right to marry my spouse. Everyone should be able to love who they want to love and should have the same right to marry, regardless of sexual orientation.
4292	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy, and I have no issue with spending time with my friends who are gay, as well as their partners. Everyone has the right to love who they want to love, regardless of sexual orientation. Everyone should have the same rights to get married, regardless of orientation.
4293	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy, and I have no issue with being around same-sex couples. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love, regardless of sexual orientation, and gay people should have the same marriage rights as straight couples.
4294	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them or their partners, and I believe that gay people have every right to get married, just as straight couples do. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love.
4295	I believe that personal growth is more beneficial in the long run, as it allows you to reach your full potential and improve your life circumstances. This helps not only the individual, but also society as a whole, as better individuals lead to a better society.
4296	I believe that personal growth is more beneficial in the long run. It is important to focus on improving yourself and your skills so that you can make a greater impact on the world. While it is true that others may see this as being selfish, I believe that you have to focus on helping yourself first.
4297	I believe that personal growth is more important in the long run. If we do not build ourselves up, we may not be able to reach the common good. While it is important to help others, we must first focus on helping ourselves.
4298	I believe that personal growth is more important in the long run. It is essential to reach the common good if you can improve yourself, as others may see this as self-interest; however, it is important to have the capacity to help others.
4299	I believe that personal growth is more beneficial in the long run, as it enables an individual to reach their full potential and make a greater impact on the world. Though it is true that one must look out for their own interests first in order to be able to help others, it is still possible to help others while also helping oneself.
4300	I believe that laws should allow same-sex couples to have legal recognition of their union, as couples have the right to choose how they live together. Although some people may have mixed feelings about it, couples should have the freedom to choose what is best for them.
4301	I believe that couples should be able to share their lives together legally, as the law recognizes this relationship and allows the couple to live together. People's beliefs and values about marriage vary, but it is the law that should dictate what is allowed.
4302	I believe that acceptance of same-sex marriage may become more common in society as laws allow couples to formalize their unions. Religion typically plays a role in defining what is and is not socially acceptable, but couples should be able to make their own choices in regards to legal unions. People should be able to decide how they want to live their lives together.
4303	I believe that society, as a whole, will eventually come to accept same-sex marriage. Although it may take some time for people to accept it, marriage is a legal union between two people that allows them to live together. This is what the government recognizes, regardless of religious beliefs.
4304	I believe that society and governments should recognize same-sex unions in law, as couples should have the same rights and protections as any other. Every couple should be able to decide for themselves what kind of relationship they want to have and what is best for them. It should ultimately be their decision.
4305	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since 9/11, the government has passed laws such as the Patriot Act and the Terror Watch Act, which give them increased surveillance capabilities over law-abiding citizens, contrary to the Constitution. These laws allow the government to monitor phone lines, check phone records, search homes, cars and businesses without a warrant.
4306	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since 9/11, the government has passed laws such as the Patriot Act and the Terror Watch Act, which allow them to spy on law-abiding citizens, as well as search phone lines, car records and homes without a warrant, which is against the Constitution.
4307	Yes, the government does have more power than it advertises since 9/11. The Patriot Act and the Terrorism Act give the government the ability to spy on law-abiding citizens, as well as to tap phone lines, check phone records, and search cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant - all of which are contradictory to the written text of the Constitution.
4308	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since 9/11, the government has passed laws such as the Patriot Act and the Terror Watch Act, which allow them to spy on law-abiding citizens, as well as search phone lines, cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant, which is contradictory to the writing of the Constitution.
4309	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since 9/11, the government has passed laws such as the Patriot Act and the Terror Watch Act, which allow them to surveil citizens in direct contradiction of the Constitution. The Patriot Act allows them to tap phone lines and check phone records, as well as search cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant.
4310	Should they be arrested? No, but there should definitely be a hefty fine and points taken away from their license. I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  The use of cell phones while driving can be a major distraction and can lead to more serious accidents.  Handsfree devices may help, but they are no substitute for paying full attention to the road.  Additionally, cell phones can divert a driver’s attention from the road and increase the risk of an accident.  The risk of this type of distraction is increasingly becoming a factor in traffic accidents.
4311	Should they be arrested? No, but there should definitely be a substantial fine. I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time. The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency scene through all the traffic. You would be surprised at the amount of cars that do not pull over right away. The cell phone can be a major distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.
4312	Should they be arrested? Yes, but there should be significant fines and penalties in place to serve as a deterrent.  I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  The rise in cell phone use has caused a corresponding rise in traffic accidents, as users often are distracted by their devices and fail to pay attention to their surroundings.  Hands free phones help reduce this risk, as they require the user to keep their hands on the wheel and ears on the environment, but they do not offer complete protection.  It is still important for drivers to be aware of traffic conditions and keep their phones in a position that does not obstruct their view of the road.
4313	Should they be arrested? No, but there should be significant fines and other penalties to deter dangerous driving behavior. I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  You'd be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away.  The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too occupied to pay attention to their surroundings.  Hands free phones don't help that much either.  You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.  The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.

4315	I'm personally skeptical of psychics, but in desperate situations, most people would take whatever action they can to achieve their goals. A friend of mine's sister had been missing for two years before the family decided to try a psychic. With the help of the psychic and the police, the sister's body was found.
4316	I haven't personally embraced the idea of psychics, but if desperate circumstances arise, most people - including myself - would take whatever steps necessary to achieve the goal. A friend of mine's sister had been missing for over two years until the police and the psychic located the body.
4317	I am reluctant to believe in psychics myself, but in a desperate situation, most people, including myself, would do whatever it takes to get the job done. My friend's sister had been missing for two years when the family decided to use one. Between the police and the psychic, the sister's body was found.
4318	I personally do not believe in psychics, but in certain situations of desperation, most people would take measures to get the job done. A friend of mine's sister had been missing for two years, and the family decided to use one. Ultimately, the psychic and police efforts resulted in the girl's body being found.
4319	I don't personally believe in psychics, but in desperate situations, most people would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine's sister had been missing for two years, but the police and a psychic were able to locate her body.
4320	Child protection is an important issue, and parents should take steps to ensure their children's safety. Depending on the situation, parents may choose to contact the authorities or take other action to keep their children safe. If parents are concerned, they should inform the authorities and make sure that their child is safe.
4321	The safety of children must be ensured, and parents should take steps to protect their children if they feel uncomfortable with the situation. Parents can contact the police to voice their concerns and request extra precautions to ensure the child's safety.
4322	It is important to take precautions to protect yourself, especially if you are concerned about the potential danger. First, contact the chat room to inform them of your concerns and ask what safety measures they have in place. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation; the police will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4323	It is important to take measures to ensure the safety of children online. While data protection laws may prevent paedophiles from being traced directly, contacting the police and explaining the situation can help to ensure the safety of children.
4324	It is best to be cautious, especially if you are concerned about your safety. You should contact the chat room to ask what measures are in place to keep you safe, and inquire about any policies or procedures to help protect you. You should also contact the police to report your concerns and seek reassurance that every measure is taken to ensure your safety.
4325	Answering yes or no questions can be challenging as it depends on the specific question and the answer. Generally, it is best to provide an answer and then discuss the details through cross-examination. For example, with chocolate ice cream, you may like it but prefer vanilla; it is the implication of the answer that could be difficult to answer.
4326	The difficulty in answering yes and no questions is not so much the specific question and the honest answer, but the implications of that answer. While a simple yes or no answer may provide a sufficient response, it does not allow for an explanation of the full context which could be important in certain questions. Therefore, the answer should be given first, followed by a defense attorney cross-examining for further explanation.
4327	The difficulty with answering yes/no questions is not so much the specific question and the answer itself, but the implications of that answer. Yes/No answers do not reveal your likes and dislikes in full; it is the implications of the answer that is the problem.
4328	Answering yes or no questions can be difficult as it does not provide further context and can be misinterpreted; the answer alone does not necessarily mean you do not like another flavor of ice cream. It is the implications of the answer that can be difficult.
4329	Answering 'yes' or 'no' questions can be difficult as the answer itself may not provide the full context or explanation. It is the implications of the answer that can be an issue, as it depends on the specific question and the context of the answer.
4330	Most countries where abortion is legal allow it during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the foetus is not yet considered a 'foetus' according to medical definitions but is rather an 'embryo'. Although it appears very early in the pregnancy, it has already developed basic human traits and is considered a human being according to medical science. From a legal standpoint, it is generally accepted that abortion is allowed during this period.
4331	Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, allow it during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the foetus is not considered a foetus but an embryo. Pictures show that it does not resemble a human yet, and its brain function is not fully developed, therefore abortion before this point is generally considered legal.
4332	In countries where abortion is legal, the limit for access to abortion services is usually set at around 12 weeks, when the foetus is considered to be of a more human form. Prior to this point, abortion is generally not allowed, as the foetus is not considered to be a ‘human being’ according to medical and legal standards. Even before birth, the foetus has become much more developed and is considered a ‘human being’ by law.
4333	Most countries where abortion is legal allow it during the first trimester of pregnancy, according to the criteria used to define gestational age. While the foetus may not have fully developed organs at this stage, it is considered a human being and the legal status for abortion varies depending on the country. Generally, abortion is legalized before birth in order to ensure the woman's right to choose and to ensure the woman's right to a safe and legal abortion.
4334	In most countries where abortion is legal, the threshold for abortion access is usually set at around three months, when the foetus is usually referred to as an embryo rather than a fetus. Images of embryos may not resemble a human, but according to scientific research, an embryo at this stage already has a distinct brain structure and some brain functions. It is important to note that abortion is an extremely difficult decision that every woman who has had an abortion grapples with based on their own moral and conscience.
4335	I believe that we should start teaching children about disability and inclusivity from a younger age, as these attitudes and ideas need to be introduced at home in order to change societal norms. As parents, we need to make sure that our children understand the impact of their words and actions, and the importance of being inclusive of those with disabilities.
4336	I think it starts earlier than one might expect. I am appalled at the way in which children use the term "spastic" as an insult. What are they learning at home that leads them to be so insensitive? It does not get better. I was once in a position to recruit a typist, and suggested to Human Resources that a disabled person could be given the job, given their potential access to employment. I encountered bafflement. Any particular disability? I have a son with a disability who has seen these attitudes too often; he conceals his disability when job hunting, as he has seen enough of society's attitudes. We still live in many ways.
4337	I think it starts earlier than one might expect. I am appalled at the way in which children use the term "spastic" as an insult. It does not get better. I was once in a position to recruit a typist and suggested to Human Resources that a disabled person could be given the job, given their potential employability. I encountered bafflement. Any particular disability?  I have a son who has been disabled since the age of 12. He hopes to obtain a job that takes into account his considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability hidden during job hunting. He has seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
4338	I believe that children learn language and social cues from their environment at an early age, and this can have an impact on how they treat others. It is worrying that children are using terms such as “spastic” as insults, as this can lead to a lack of sensitivity towards disabilities at a young age. While attitudes towards disabilities can improve over time, I have experienced cases where this is not the case and my son, who has a disability, needs to hide it when job hunting.
4339	I think it starts earlier than we realise. I am concerned by the way children use the term ‘spastic’ as an insult. It does not get better. I was once in a position to recruit a typist and suggested that a disabled person could be given the job, which could help them gain employment. I was asked ‘what particular disability’. My son has a disability since age 12, which he keeps hidden when job hunting. He has experienced such attitudes too. We still live in a jungle in many ways.
4340	Here in Florida, it is legal for a person to use deadly force if they believe it is necessary to protect themselves or their family. While I believe this law could present challenges for law enforcement, I would still choose to defend myself and my family if necessary.
4341	They can now in some states, including Florida, where it is legal for a person to use deadly force if they feel that they are in danger. I believe this could create issues for law enforcement, as it may be more difficult for them to carry out their duties.
4342	In Florida, a person is legally permitted to use deadly force if they believe it is necessary to protect themselves or another person from imminent danger. In some cases, this law could create issues for law enforcement officers who are trying to do their job, as it removes a layer of protection for the public. It is important to consider how this law could impact officers in the line of duty.
4343	In some states, including Florida, it is legal for a person to use deadly force if they believe they are in danger. While this law may provide some protection for citizens, it could pose a risk to law enforcement officers who need to investigate cases.
4344	In some states, including Florida, it is legal for a person to use deadly force if they believe they are in danger. This law could interfere with police officers' ability to do their jobs as they may have to wait for backup in certain situations. While some people may believe this law is OK, it could be very problematic in such cases.
4345	I believe that the criminal justice system involves more than just enforcement; it also involves the legal profession, as well as lawmakers, to create public policy. Money can play a role in influencing public opinion and elections, as seen in democracies, which allows the wealthy to buy influence and change laws. This power and influence comes from the people with money.
4346	I agree that lawmaking plays an important role in creating public policy, however, lawmakers are not the only source of power in a democracy. In reality, money can often buy influence and change laws, which gives the power back to the wealthy.
4347	I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justice system as the professional group.  As in the series Law and Order, it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession.  Part of the system is the lawmakers, as well as regulators and courts to ensure laws are upheld.  Public policy is not always easy to define; it can be changed by collective effort of the people, or swayed by money which can buy almost any election and legislation.
4348	I agree that the entire criminal justice system involves more than just enforcement; it includes lawmakers, enforcement, and legal professionals. Public policy can be difficult to define, as money can often play a role in influencing public opinion and elections. Law enforcement and the courts offer direct power, while those who make the laws provide the true power, which is ultimately in the hands of the people.
4349	I believe that the criminal justice system involves more than just law enforcement; it also includes the legal profession, lawmakers, and the courts. Public policy is not always easy to define, as money can influence public opinion and elections. Police and judges are the direct enforcers of laws, while those who make the laws provide the true power, which is ultimately determined by the wealthy.
4350	Filing a defamation of character lawsuit may be an option, but it would be expensive and time-consuming. It is likely that civil courts prefer settlements between both parties rather than involving the police. It may be best to simply let these matters go and take the higher road, being mindful of your actions and confident that your character is known and respected by those around you.
4351	You could file a defamation of character lawsuit, which could be expensive and messy. Alternatively, taking the high road and living your life honorably can help you cope with such issues, as people will ultimately understand your actions.
4352	It is possible to file a defamation of character lawsuit, however this would be expensive and potentially messy for both parties. It may be better to simply let it go and continue to live your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and are not worthy of your attention.
4353	Filing a defamation of character lawsuit is an option, but it would be expensive and potentially tricky for both parties. It may be better to simply let it go and focus on living your life with integrity, knowing that such issues are ultimately in the past and that your character will shine through.
4354	Filing a defamation of character lawsuit can be an option, but it is expensive and would be time-consuming and difficult for both parties. In this situation, it may be better to simply let it go and take the higher road, staying true to your character and knowing that these people are petty.
4355	I believe that violent rape and child molestation are heinous crimes that deserve appropriate punishment. In my opinion, life imprisonment is an effective way to keep these offenders from re-entering society and protect the public.
4356	Violent rape and child molestation are heinous crimes that should be punished with the death penalty, as life in prison does not provide adequate protection for the public. We can maintain these lists to ensure public safety by keeping these individuals behind bars, where they cannot pose a danger to society.
4357	Given that violent rape and child molestation are heinous crimes that can have a lasting impact on victims and their families, I believe that the perpetrators of these crimes should face harsh punishments, such as the death penalty or life imprisonment. However, I believe that these punishments should be tailored to the crime and the individual, as imprisonment alone may not be enough to protect the public.
4358	Violent rape and child molestation are heinous crimes that warrant strong punishments, such as life imprisonment or the death penalty. Currently, the government creates sex offender lists in order to protect the public, though this makes less sense since these offenders are already out of prison.
4359	In some cases, such as violent rape and child molestation, the death penalty is a more appropriate sentence than life imprisonment. This is to ensure that these offenders cannot harm anyone else while they are in prison. While it is understandable to have sex offender lists to protect the public, it does not make sense to allow these offenders to be released from prison if they are still a danger.
4360	Lawyers can be quite adept at asking questions that they already know the answers to in order to gain information from a witness. They may use various strategies to get the witness to reveal information, such as speaking in a confident manner or using leading questions. It is important to remain calm and keep a cool head in order to ensure the truth of one's statements are acknowledged.
4361	Lawyers can be skilled at asking questions to get the information they need. They may use tactics to undermine your testimony, such as speaking in a demanding voice or using body language, which can make it difficult to convey confidence. It is important to remain calm and remain composed throughout the proceedings.
4362	Lawyers can be tricky, as they typically only ask questions they know the answers to. They use various tactics to get you to say what they want, which could make it difficult to prove your statements. It is important to remain calm and maintain a cool head to ensure that your testimony is given due weight.
4363	Lawyers can be sly, using tactics to get the other side to say what they want. They may speak in a demanding tone to undermine the other party’s statements and make it more difficult to prove their case. It is important to remain calm and keep a cool head to counter this.
4364	Lawyers can be very skillful in obtaining the information they want. They may ask questions that they already know the answers to, or use tactics to get the other party to say what they want. It is important to remain calm and keep a cool head to ensure that your statements are heard and respected.
4365	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit crimes when they know citizens are armed. This is due to the deterrent effect guns have on crime, which means crime rates are lower. The Second Amendment is there to protect the citizens’ ability to fight back against a government that may become too powerful. Hunting rifles are no match for machine guns.
4366	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit crimes when confronted by an armed citizen, as crime rates tend to drop when this is the case. The Second Amendment is in place to give citizens the ability to oppose a government that overstepped its bounds. In terms of firearm power, a hunting rifle is not a match for a machine gun.
4367	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit crimes when confronted by an armed citizen. This is due to the fact that an armed citizenry makes it more difficult for criminals to operate. Furthermore, the Second Amendment is in place to ensure that citizens are able to defend themselves if the government were to become tyrannical.
4368	Statistics show that criminals are less likely to commit crimes when facing armed citizens, as crime rates drop. The Second Amendment is there to ensure our ability to fight back against a government that might become tyrannical. Hunting rifles are no match for machine guns.
4369	Statistics show that when citizens are armed, crime rates drop. This is because criminals are less likely to commit crimes when they know that the citizens are armed. Additionally, the Second Amendment is in place to allow citizens to have the ability to fight back against a government that may become tyrannical. This gives citizens an equal chance against machine guns if necessary.
4370	This is a constitutional right to access the courts. It can be difficult to prove harm, as the court will look at the context of the situation. Access to the courts depends on the state’s laws, so it is important to check the statutes for more information on how to proceed with the case.
4371	This is a right to access law. It is easier to win if you can show that the other person's actions caused you emotional distress.  It is important to have testimony from a therapist to back up the claim.  It may depend on your state's laws. You should get in contact with either Legal Aid or the Attorney General's Office to find out more information on how to make a winning case.
4372	This is a legal right that most people have. It may depend on your state laws as to how you can prove a case. You may need to demonstrate that the other party's actions caused you emotional distress. It may also require evidence from a therapist that the other party's actions increased your anxiety.
4373	This is a Constitutional right to access the courts. Depending on the state, you may need to show that the defendant's actions caused you harm in order to win a case. It can be difficult to prove this link, so it is important to get the help of an attorney if possible. Otherwise, Legal Aid or the Attorney General's office can provide information on how to make the elements of a winning case.
4374	This is a Constitutional right to access the courts. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff in a civil case, meaning you must present evidence that the other party's actions caused you harm. This is usually established through the testimony of a therapist or other medical professional. It can be difficult to prove, depending on the state's laws. Legal aid or the Attorney General's office can provide information on how to make a winning case.
4375	It matters to those of us who attended schools where language and communication were prioritized, as well as to those who had parents who encouraged communication and who valued language learning. If you do not believe that this is important, then you may conclude that it is not crucial. I believe that having language skills and being able to communicate well are valuable assets, as they can help one to better connect with others and make one's experiences richer.
4376	It matters to those of us who attended schools where learning was emphasized, had parents who encouraged us to learn, and/or had jobs where we were required to have a certain level of literacy. If you are able to learn and grow without some of those factors being present, then you may well conclude that learning is irrelevant and I respect that. I think that having an education that enables one to think critically and become literate is of value regardless of one's personal preferences. Learning can be beneficial to one's overall development even if it does not appeal to one personally.
4377	It matters to those of us who attended schools where language and literacy skills were emphasized, as well as having parents who encouraged us to develop these skills and having jobs that make it important. If you are able to navigate life without these factors being present, then you may reach the conclusion that language and literacy skills are somewhat irrelevant. I believe that having strong language and literacy skills are beneficial to anyone and can lead to a better life. Additionally, I believe it is better to be a good and caring person than to have perfect language and literacy skills.
4378	It matters to those of us who attended schools where education was emphasized and who had parents who stressed its importance. If it is not important to you, then you may well conclude that it is relatively unimportant. However, I believe that it is better to have a good understanding of language and communication skills as they are valuable assets in life.
4379	I believe that having an education that emphasizes the importance of things like grammar and communication can be beneficial, as it gives you an understanding of how language works and the skills to communicate effectively. If you have the opportunity to attend schools and access resources that promote this, it can be beneficial. This can include parents who model good communication and language use, as well as schools which emphasize language skills and other learning opportunities. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide if this is important for them.
4380	see... it's a little thing called freedom... people are free to speak and write in whatever language they choose. If you don't like it, there are many options for people to choose from. There are languages that are dominant in certain areas, but the US government generally does not interfere in what language businesses choose to use. So it is up to the business owner to make that decision. Just because a business caters to Spanish speakers does not mean that Spanish is the only language they must speak. Again, it is a matter of choice.
4381	See... it's a little thing called freedom. People are free to speak and write in the language they choose. If you don't like it, there are businesses that cater to Spanish-speaking customers, which is entirely legal and acceptable in the US. If the government needs to intervene, it will be when it has more pressing matters to deal with. It is not the job of the government to dictate language usage in the nation, nor should it.
4382	See... it's a little thing called freedom. People have the right to speak and write in whatever language they choose, and businesses are allowed to cater to the languages they prefer. If you don't like it, you don't have to speak or do business with them. That's how it works. There are a lot of things the government needs to do before it starts regulating languages.
4383	see... it's a little thing called freedom... the government does not have an obligation to ensure that businesses cater to particular language groups, nor are they required to enforce language laws. As consumers, we have the choice to speak or not to speak to businesses that cater to particular language groups. It is our choice in America how businesses are run.
4384	see... it's a little thing called freedom... maybe a grandpa of yours died for it... but people are free to speak, write, and do business in the language they choose. if you don't like it... you don't have to talk to them or do business there, but the government has no right to tell businesses or customers what language to use.  As Americans value the right to freedom of speech, the government generally stays out of language requirements.
4385	Wind and wave power could be used to generate electricity, which could then be used to split water into its components. Oxygen could be released into the air, and the hydrogen could be burned to produce water as the main product. Vegetable sources could be used to create the lubricating oils, making it more environmentally friendly.
4386	Wind and wave power could be used to generate electricity, which could then be used to split water into its components, allowing oxygen to be released into the air and Hydrogen to be used in cars. This could be done in back gardens, with vegetable sources potentially used to create the lubricating oils.
4387	Wind or wave power could be used to generate electricity, which could then be used to split water into its components. Oxygen could be released into the atmosphere, and the Hydrogen could be burned to create water as the resulting product. This could work in back gardens with vegetable oil sources for lubricating.
4388	Wind and wave power can be used to generate electricity, which can then be used to split water into its components. The oxygen produced can be released into the atmosphere, while the hydrogen can be burned in cars, resulting in water as the main product. Using renewable sources for our lubricating oils would be possible from vegetable sources.
4389	Oil does rule all politics unfortunately, but we could use wind or wave power to generate electricity, split water into its components, and use the hydrogen to power our cars, with water as the resulting byproduct. We could even use vegetable oils as lubricants. This system could work in any back garden.
4390	From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  Legally, it is an enforceable contract, and ethically, I believe that you should repay the debt, explain to your granddaughter that this is the only wedding gift you can afford, and then let it go.
4391	From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  I believe that, ethically, she should forgive some portion of the debt because she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you, but this should be done on a cooperative basis, and you and your granddaughter should find a way to move past this without pursuing legal action.  As her grandfather, it is up to you to make that call.
4392	From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  To forgive some portion of the debt would be between you and her, and from an ethical standpoint, it is my opinion that you should repay her, tell her that this is the only wedding gift you can afford and let it go.
4393	From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  Although it was difficult financially, you agreed to it for her sake.  I believe that you should repay her, let her know that this is the only wedding gift you can afford, and let it go.  This can help salvage your relationship with her.
4394	From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract: offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  Regardless of the circumstances, ethics suggest that both parties should abide by the contract, and given that your granddaughter was willing to provide the loan, she should forgive some portion of the debt, as she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you.  I believe that this compromise is the best solution to the situation, and the action of forgiving some portion of the debt is the most ethical thing to do.
4395	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. This does not seem right to me. Taxing the drug may help bring in revenue for the government, while regulating it may reduce the potential harm of the drug.
4396	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. This does not seem right to me. Additionally, regulating it can help generate revenue for the government, as well as saving costs from the so-called “war on drugs”. Laws would be the same; you need to be 21 to purchase it. Drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana can both impair a person’s ability to drive, and employers can still fire employees for being under the influence at work.
4397	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded and the government spends a lot of money on the "War on Drugs," which is largely losing. Legalization could bring in much-needed revenue for the government, as well as provide better regulation of drugs and the ability to tax the substances. People would have to be 21 to purchase the drugs, as with alcohol, and driving under the influence would still be illegal. Laws would remain largely the same.
4398	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. This does not seem right to me. Regulating it and taxing the hell out of it could bring in a lot of revenue for the government, while saving money from the so-called “war on drugs”. Laws would remain largely the same; simply, you must be 21 to buy it.
4399	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. This does not seem right to me. Regulating it and taxing the heck out of it could generate considerable revenue for the government, not to mention the savings from the so-called “war on drugs” which is clearly losing. Laws would remain largely unchanged; individuals must be 21 years of age to buy the substance, and driving under the influence of drugs carries the same penalties as driving under the influence of alcohol.
4400	In some cases, a court may issue a warrant for a traffic violation, although the individual is not required to be notified of this. You can call the court to make payment arrangements; you will need to pay the original fine, as well as any warrant fees, interest and other legal costs imposed by the local laws. Alternatively, you can choose to ignore the warrant, and risk being arrested if stopped for another traffic violation.
4401	The court does not have to notify you when a warrant is issued, so you will need to contact the court to make payment arrangements. You will have to pay the original fine, as well as any warrant fees, interest and other legal costs that the local laws allow. If you choose to ignore the warrant, you run the risk of being arrested in the future if a warrant is issued for a minor traffic violation.
4402	Call the court to make payment arrangements, as warrants are not required to be notified to the individual. While warrants may have been issued, it is up to the court on the fine amount, plus any fees and interest the local laws allow. Choosing to ignore it could lead to being arrested for a outstanding warrant in the future during a simple traffic stop.
4403	You will not receive a warrant, as courts do not typically notify individuals when a warrant has been issued. You will need to call the court to make payment arrangements. You may have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, as well as interest and other charges as allowed by local laws. If you choose to ignore the warrant, you run the risk of being arrested for a similar traffic violation in the future.
4404	Payment arrangements must be made with the court to settle a traffic warrant. You will have to pay the original fine, as well as any related fees such as warrant fees, interest and other local laws allow. If ignored, the warrant could result in an arrest when stopped for a minor traffic violation in the future.
4405	Clinton oversaw an era of budget surpluses and decreased national debt, which was largely due to the strong economy he oversaw, although the Iraq War and its aftermath have placed a major strain on the government's finances.
4406	Clinton left us with a surplus, although it was short-lived. The economy was good during this time. Bush’s tax cuts and the response to 9/11 had an adverse effect on the economy and we ended up with an large deficit. It is now estimated to be around 8 trillion dollars. Iraq war and reconstruction costs are being borrowed, which is adding to the debt.
4407	Clinton left office with a budget surplus, which was eventually wiped out by the Bush administration. Clinton maintained a budget surplus for a short time, although the economy was still doing relatively well. The deficit grew under Bush, who saddled us with this deficit, which is currently around $8 trillion plus. We are paying for the Iraq War and the rebuilding of Iraq with tax money. The Iraqi oil money is going to pay for this.
4408	Clinton oversaw the elimination of the deficit and a brief surplus, which was beneficial for the economy. However, the deficit increased again under Bush due to the costs of the Iraq War and the rebuilding of Iraq, as well as the costs of the tax cuts.
4409	Clinton was able to eliminate the deficit and we had a surplus for a short time, all while the economy was good. However, the deficit ballooned under Bush, who saddled us with a large deficit. It is now around $8 trillion, with much of the cost of the Iraq War and rebuilding Iraq being borrows. The Iraqi oil money is sold, with much of the money going to these reconstruction costs.
4410	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the preferred option for treating criminals rather than sending them to prison. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal; instead, the environment they are brought up in plays a key role in determining this. With the right care and guidance, individuals can grow and mature properly.  Therefore, the help of psychologists and psychiatrists can be instrumental in altering bad behaviors.
4411	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the most effective way to deal with criminals, rather than imprisonment. While it is true that one's environment plays a role in influencing criminal behavior, with the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, such behaviors can be addressed and corrected.

Psychological treatment can help alter negative behaviors and remedy the issues.
4413	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sentencing them to prison. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal. The primary determinant for a person to become one is often due to having a difficult upbringing. With the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, negative behaviors can be addressed and alleviated.
4414	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the most effective way to treat criminals compared to sending them to prison. It is true that environment plays a role in influencing a person's behaviour; with the help of psychologists and psychiatrists, bad behaviours can be addressed and alleviated.
4415	We need to enact term limits in both the House and Senate of no more than two terms in order to ensure fresh ideas and perspectives are encouraged in our legislature. Moreover, younger people should be given the opportunity to serve in order to allow them to make an impact and have a lasting change on our legislative system.
4416	We need term limits for members of the House and Senate to ensure that fresh perspectives are represented in Congress and to ensure that legislators do not stay in office for too long. This will allow for new ideas to be introduced and new legislation to be passed.
4417	We've got a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there who have been in office for many years and are able to create laws and policies that benefit them and their networks. This leads to a disconnect between elected officials and the public, as well as limited access to the system for new ideas. To break up this system, we need term limits of no more than two terms for both houses. This will allow for more citizen representation and more competition for seats in Congress.
4418	We need to enact term limits in both the House and Senate to ensure that legislators are accountable to the people and are not able to stay in office for more than two consecutive terms. This would allow for fresh perspectives and ideas to enter the legislature and create a more dynamic system.
4419	We need to enact term limits in both the House and Senate, to ensure that politicians are held accountable and that new ideas and perspectives are brought into the system. This would allow citizens to have more input and ensure that their voices are heard.  Getting people with good intentions into the system is essential to passing Bills, as they need to team up with someone who is already established in order to do so. This enables them to make changes to the system.
4420	I understand the rules in your area regarding littering, but it is difficult to determine whether or not you were the one who tossed the butt out of the window without more information. It is possible to challenge the ruling in court, however this can be expensive and time consuming, so you should weigh up your chances of success before deciding to take it further.
4421	I understand the penalties for littering can be severe, and it can be difficult to prove the source of the litter. It is important to note that if the officer was able to observe you throwing the butt out of the window, the law enforcement authorities can assume it was you who did it. My suggestion is to take the case to court and try to challenge the officer's observations. It is possible to win the case, however, this can be a lengthy and expensive process.
4422	I understand the fine could be a financial burden; however, it is important to weigh the potential risks and consequences of both taking the case to court and paying the fine. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which option is better for you. If you believe you have a strong case and can win in court, then it could be worth going to court to challenge the fine.
4423	I understand the rule about not throwing cigarettes out of the window, as there is a risk of starting a forest fire. It is possible that the officer was correct in fining you, depending on the details of the case. If you believe that you can win the case, it is worth taking it to court. However, this could be expensive and you may still have to pay the fine and court costs if you lose.
4424	I understand that fines may be imposed for littering, especially if it is done near vegetation that could contribute to a forest fire. It is possible to challenge the fine in court, however, this could be costly and time-consuming. It is important to evaluate the situation to determine if the officer could reasonably prove it was the defendant's cigarette.

4427	In California, the law states that the driver of a vehicle is responsible for ensuring that all passengers, regardless of age, are wearing seatbelts. If a minor passenger does not wear a seatbelt, the driver could receive a ticket in addition to the minor getting one. Additionally, if the minor is not in the driver's car or if the driver is not driving, the driver is not legally responsible for the minor.
4428	In California, you are responsible for any passengers in your car, whether they are minors or not. If one of your passengers is not wearing a seatbelt, you could receive a ticket along with them receiving one, even if they are an adult. This is the case even if you and their parents are not legally responsible for them.
4429	In California, as the driver, you are responsible for the safety of all passengers in your car, whether they are minors or not.

4437	Seek legal advice if you are facing the possibility of losing your job or home. It is better to be proactive and take steps to protect your rights and interests. Lawyers can advise you on your options and chances of success.
4438	It is important to seek legal advice if you are facing a potential job loss or home eviction. While it is upsetting to think about losing everything, it is important to take action to protect your rights and interests. An attorney can advise you of your options and chances of success.
4439	Get legal advice as soon as possible. If you lose your job, you could potentially lose everything, including your home and your children's future. It is important to take action now to protect your rights. Most employers will try to terminate employment in order to avoid paying compensation, so it is essential to consider your legal options. Seeking legal advice can help you understand your chances of success.
4440	How can it not? Inside, prisons have their own sets of laws and regulations that prisoners must adhere to; if these laws are not followed, there is the possibility of death. Prison environments can act as a deterrent to crime.
4441	How can it not? Inside, prisoners must adhere to the rules and regulations of the prison system. If a prisoner does not follow the rules, they could face sanctions such as additional security or even death. Prison provides some measure of security, as criminals are unlikely to fear consequences for their crimes.  While prison may act as a deterrent to some crimes, it is not a guarantee that crime will not occur.
4442	How can it not? Inside, prisons have their own laws and rules that prisoners must obey, or they could face serious consequences such as death. This makes prison a deterrent to crime, as the fear of being imprisoned can be a significant deterrent. However, some prisons are now becoming less strict, which makes prison less of a deterrent.
4443	How can it not? Inside prisons, inmates are subject to separate sets of laws and regulations that must be obeyed, or there is the risk of death. While this varies by state, many states now have less control over prisons, leading to an increased risk of crime.
4444	How can it not? Inside prisons, prisoners must obey certain laws and regulations set by the government in order to maintain order and safety. If prisoners do not follow these laws, they could face serious consequences, such as death. While prison may not be as effective a deterrent to crime as it once was, prison authorities are able to enforce laws more effectively than they were in the past.
4445	I understand how difficult this situation is for your sister. Although it is difficult to separate parents from their children in the courts, I believe that the court system generally tries to maintain relationships between parents and children whenever possible. My suggestion would be to support her and help her find a way to regain her family if that is what she desires, while also encouraging her to be careful and save some money for herself in case she needs it.
4446	I understand that it can be difficult for the court to order custody changes; however, if she wants her family back, she should be supported in this effort. She should also be aware that there are options available to save money for a ‘just in case’ fund.
4447	I understand that this can be difficult to do in the courts, however, if she wants her family back, it is important to have a support system in place to ensure that she has the resources she needs. I will help her in this process and also encourage her to be cautious and save some money on the side in case she needs it.
4448	I understand that taking away children from their mother can be difficult in the courts, however, if she wants her family back, she should try to resolve the situation and be cautious. Support her if possible, and if she feels that the grass is not greener on the other side, then encourage her to save some money for herself as a just-in-case fund.
4449	I understand that separating from a partner can be difficult, especially when children are involved. While I believe it is important for families to stay together when possible, it is up to the courts to decide custody arrangements. I will support my sister in her decision and help her to save money for a rainy day.
4450	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — without judicial oversight, this undermines democracy and creates a state within the statute that is not accountable to the law or to the people. This creates a domain of the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people, which is typically a hallmark of dictatorships.
4451	If government agencies, such as the NSA, are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people in this country, without the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, it undermines democracy and creates a state within the statute that is not accountable to the people. This could potentially weaken the democracy, as judicial oversight is necessary to ensure its integrity and accountability.
4452	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — without judicial oversight, the government could potentially infringe upon the privacy of individuals and undermine democracy, thus creating a state within the statute that is not accountable to the law or the people. This could be seen as a potential threat to democracy, even if it is a flawed version of it.
4453	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — without the oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, this undermines democracy and creates a state within the government that is not accountable to the people. This is a clear violation of the principles of democracy, which require transparency and accountability in decision-making.
4454	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — *without* the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy (however fake of a democracy it is) and creates a state within the state which could gain more influence and power over time, thus endangering the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike.
4455	In some countries, same-sex couples have limited legal recognition and protections, such as in the United States, where married same-sex couples have some federal rights, but domestic partnerships and civil unions are only available in certain states. Additionally, some countries do not recognize same-sex marriage. This can be frustrating for LGBTQ+ individuals, as they cannot have the same rights and protections as other couples.
4456	In some states, same-sex couples are now allowed to marry and get the same rights as heterosexual couples, which offers some protections for same-sex couples, although full equality still needs to be fought for in many countries. While the situation is better than before, there is still work to be done to ensure full rights for same-sex couples.
4457	While there is still progress to be made in terms of equalizing gay partners' rights, there have been some steps taken in this direction in recent years. However, full federal recognition of gay partnerships is still a way off.
4458	In some states, gay couples may have limited domestic partnership rights, allowing them to share health care coverage and tax benefits, but these rights are not available in all states. This can be difficult for couples who have been together for a long time and do not have these protections.
4459	In some states in the US, same-sex couples have the right to marry and receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples, but this is not the case in every state. Additionally, some states do not recognize same-sex unions, meaning that same-sex couples may not have the same rights as opposite-sex couples.
4460	While it is generally true that a woman’s body is the best indicator of when she is ready for menopause, it is still up to her and her doctor to decide if she is physically and emotionally ready for the changes that come with it.
4461	In general, a woman's body is able to tell her when she is physically ready for menopause; however, this can vary from one person to another.
4462	While a woman is able to physically tell when she is ready to start menstruating, the biological changes needed to occur for this to happen may take longer in some cases, depending on the individual.
4463	There is no definitive answer as to when a woman is physically and emotionally ready for pregnancy and childbirth, as it varies from woman to woman. Generally, a woman can become physically capable of having a child once she reaches adolescence, but it is still important to take her overall health and maturity into consideration.
4464	While it is generally up to a woman to decide when she is ready to start her period, the physical and hormonal changes of puberty can vary in terms of when they begin.
4465	Yes, it is possible to be emancipated even if you are not pregnant. It provides a judge with a reason to approve the request. Generally, it is not too difficult to do; it takes about 30 minutes to complete the forms, a couple of signatures, and a few minutes in front of the judge. I recommend emancipation if you are going to be the one who signs for your child; it is better to have this option available.
4466	It depends on the state but in some states, emancipation is possible for minors even if they are not pregnant. Generally, emancipation requires a judge's approval, so it could take some time and involve meeting with a judge and completing paperwork.  However, this process is relatively straightforward and can be done fairly quickly.
4467	Yes, it is possible to be emancipated even if you are not pregnant. It will provide a judge with a reason to approve the request, which may take around 30 minutes to complete the forms, signatures, and a short hearing in front of the judge. It is a good idea to get emancipation in place if you will be the one signing documents on your child's behalf in the future.
4468	Yes, it is possible to be emancipated if you are not pregnant. It provides a judge with a reason to approve the request, which can be done relatively quickly through the court system.  It is possible to do this, but it is advisable to do so if you are going to need to sign documents on your child's behalf.
4469	Yes, it is possible to be emancipated, depending on the state. Generally, it is done if the minor is not pregnant, which provides a judge with a valid reason to approve the request.  However, this can vary by state.  I personally did it and it took about 30 minutes to complete the forms, a couple of signatures, and a few minutes in front of the judge. It was fairly easy, so I recommend it, if you are going to be the one who signs for your child.
4470	They should be subjected to painful punishments, such as castration, in order to deter crime and ensure that the perpetrators suffer consequences. It is unfair that the death penalty is an option in some cases, when the perpetrator may face less severe punishment. The families of the victims should be given justice, and the victims themselves should not have to suffer any more than necessary.
4471	They should be subjected to painful punishments, such as castration, in order to serve as a deterrent and ensure justice is served. While death is the ultimate penalty, it is only right that criminals pay a price for their crimes. It is unfair that victims and their families must suffer for the rest of their lives, which is why punishments should be harsh and just.
4472	They should be subjected to physical and mental torture as punishment for the crime, to ensure that the offender experiences consequences for their actions and to deter others from committing similar crimes. There is no ‘one size fits all’ punishment, but the government should have the discretion to decide the severity of the punishment based on the gravity of the crime.
4473	They should be subjected to painful forms of punishment to ensure that the perpetrator suffers accordingly. Execution is not as severe as death, and the victims’ family and the victim are often left with life-long trauma. In comparison, death penalty offenders may face lesser punishment but the victims’ families are still affected. This serves as a form of retribution to the victims and their families.
4474	I believe that the death penalty is a more humane option than life imprisonment, as the person will no longer suffer from their crimes, while their family and victims must live with the consequences for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the death penalty is more cost-effective for the government than life imprisonment, as life imprisonment incurs higher costs for the government in providing medical care for the prisoner.
4475	Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and under U.S. law, such use of trademarks and copyrights is generally allowed, provided that companies do not intend to deceive consumers or infringe on other companies' intellectual property.
4476	Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use and copyright law protect such use.
4477	Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.  By law, companies must ensure that their advertisements are truthful and not misleading.
4478	Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use and the First Amendment generally protect such use of trademarks and copyrights.

4480	I believe individuals have the right to determine when and how they die. I believe individuals have the right to take their own life if they choose to, either by ending their life through “direct” methods such as a painless poisoning or by “indirect” methods such as turning off the machine that keeps their heart beating. If an individual is unable to do it themselves, they should have the right to ask someone else to do it. Generally, individuals should have the right to make this decision independently, either by themselves or with help from another person.
4481	I believe individuals have the right to choose how and when to end their own life, if the situations becomes unbearable. If the individual chooses to end their life through suicide, they should have the right to do it themselves or ask another person to do it. It should be their own decision whether to use direct or indirect methods. While it is important to consider the potential legal and ethical implications, individuals should have the right to make these decisions.
4482	I believe that individuals have the right to determine when and how they die, including the right to end their own life. If someone is suffering greatly and believes that the quality of their life is unbearable, they should have the autonomy to decide when and how they end their life. This includes the right to take their own life, either by choosing a method such as assisted suicide or physically ending their own life. It also includes the right to ask another person to take their life, either by committing assisted suicide or by some other means.  Ultimately, these decisions should be made by the individual themselves.
4483	I believe that every person has the right to decide when they want to end their life, either by choosing to take their own life or by asking another person to do it. In some cases, a person may not be able to take their own life, either physically or mentally. If this is the case, they should have the right to request assisted suicide. This could be either by directly administering a lethal substance or by utilizing technology to stop the machine in cases where the person’s heart is still beating.
4484	I believe that individuals should have the right to determine when and how they die. One should be able to end their own life if they choose, either by taking direct action such as using a poison to end their life or by using indirect methods such as turning off the machine that keeps their heart beating. If the pain and suffering become unbearable, individuals should have the right to make this decision for themselves.
4485	Look at the brain from a physical and chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we experience sensory stimuli, and these neurons interact with one another through chemical processes that are well understood. These neurons then interact with other neurons, and this chain reaction is what eventually triggers a response in the brain. Thus, the brain always reacts in the same way given the same stimuli.
4486	Look at the brain from a physical/chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we see/smell/hear/touch/taste things. These neurons interact with other neurons via chemical processes that are understood. These neurons interact with more neurons, and so on, forming a chain reaction that eventually triggers motor neurons which cause a response. In this way, our brains have a consistent reaction to stimuli.
4487	Look at the brain from a physical/chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we see/smell/hear/touch/taste things. These neurons interact with other neurons via chemical processes that are well understood. These neurons interact with more neurons, and so on, and so on... Eventually motor neurons are triggered which cause us to respond to the sensory input. In this process, the neurons have a certain effect, depending on the situation, in a consistent way. Therefore, our brains will always react in the same way, given the same situation.
4488	The brain is made up of neurons that are connected to each other via chemical processes. These interactions between neurons form a chain reaction, which is eventually triggered by motor neurons, resulting in a response to the sensory input. While the exact details of this chain reaction may vary between individuals, the overall reaction is similar for similar stimuli.
4489	The brain is made up of neurons which are interconnected through chemical processes that are well understood. These neurons interact with each other and trigger a response in the brain, as motor neurons are involved in the transmission of signals between the sensory and motor areas of the brain. This chain reaction is largely the same for each person, with only slight variations in response depending on the individual.
4490	My reasoning is simple:  - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre-cleaned", which reduces the efficiency of the machine. This defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher in the first place, as I have already paid for a machine that does not have food processing capabilities.  - dishwashers often struggle to remove ingrained or dried-on gunk, making the process less effective. This is worsened if the dishes are left over a couple of days, thus necessitating the need for manual cleaning.  - dishwashers have trouble drying deep items like Tupperware and pots. If care is not taken, the entire load can become wet, rendering the process useless.
4491	My reasoning is simple:   - Dishwashers require the dishes to be pre-cleaned, which defeats the purpose of having a machine in the kitchen. Additionally, dishwashers require more work to be done manually, as they do not have the food processing capabilities of a regular dishwasher.  - Dishwashers rarely remove ingrained or dried gunk, making the process useless. This is even more pronounced when the dishes have to be left over a couple of days.  - Dishwashers do not properly dry “deep” items like Tupperware and pots, requiring extra care when taking them out. As such, the dishwasher is less practical than it appears.
4492	My reasoning is as follows:  - Dishwashers require the dishes to be pre-cleaned, which can be time consuming and limits the machine's efficiency. This eliminates some of the purpose of having a dishwasher.  - Dishwashers often have difficulty removing ingrained or dried-on gunk, which can worsen if the dishes are left over several days. This makes the process less efficient.  - Dishwashers may require manual cleaning of deeper items such as Tupperware and pots, which is time-consuming and reduces the usefulness of the appliance.
4493	My reasoning is simple:   - Dishwashers require the dishes to be pre-cleaned, which defeats the purpose of having a machine that processes food.  - Dishwashers rarely remove ingrained or dried-on gunk, which can worsen over time if the dishes are left for a couple of days. This makes the process useless.  - Dishwashers have difficulty drying “deep” items like Tupperware and pots, meaning that care must be taken to avoid everything else becoming wet.
4494	- Dishwashers can be useful for quickly cleaning dishes, however, they are less effective for removing ingrained or dried gunk. It is generally necessary to take the dishes out, rinse them manually, and then dry them to ensure they are completely dry.  - Dishwashers are more efficient than hand-washing, but are still more time consuming than using a dishwasher.  This can make the process less convenient than manual cleaning.  - Dishwashers are generally more expensive than manual cleaning, as they require both energy and water usage, which drives up the cost.
4495	By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all African-Americans grow up in high-risk neighborhoods, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There’s also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (e.g. Affirmative Action), they somehow “deserve it” due to their “white privilege.” No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad; treating anyone differently based on race is wrong.
4496	I believe that the concept of 'white privilege' assumes that white people have easier lives than minorities. This is no different from assuming that all black people grow up in difficult environments, join gangs, and face challenges in education. Not all African-Americans live in poverty, and white people also experience hardships in life. There is also this idea that if a white person is discriminated against, they 'deserve it' because of their 'white privilege'. However, no one gets to choose their upbringing; good or bad treatment is simply wrong.
4497	By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have easier lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people have an easier life is no different than assuming that all African-Americans grow up in disadvantaged environments and have fewer opportunities. It is wrong to treat anyone differently based on their circumstances due to the legacy of their ancestors. Everyone has the right to an equal opportunity regardless of race.
4498	By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better life opportunities than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people have easier lives than African Americans is no different than assuming that all African Americans grow up in disadvantaged neighborhoods, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African Americans come from impoverished backgrounds, and not all white people have easier lives. Everyone has different experiences, and no one gets to choose their upbringings. Treating anyone differently because of their ancestors’ circumstances is wrong.
4499	I believe that the concept of 'white privilege' implies that white people have an easier life than minorities, which is no different from assuming that all African Americans grow up in impoverished environments and join gangs, despite the fact that not all African Americans have these experiences. Similarly, some African Americans may benefit from affirmative action, though white people may not necessarily "deserve" this due to their privilege. Everyone has the right to a fair upbringing regardless of race. Such treatment is wrong.
4500	And the invasion of Gaza is unjustified and impractical. Its similar to Iraq, where invading countries has not stopped terrorism and only further radicalizes people, leading to greater support for Hamas militants. Israel has killed more Israeli citizens than Gazans, which shows that Israel is the aggressor and the Gazans are caught in the crossfire.
4501	And the invasion of Gaza is unjustified and impractical. Its similar to Iraq, where Israel has targeted civilians in order to justify its actions and limit Palestinian casualties. 50 Israelis have died compared to 1500 Palestinians, which indicates that Israel is the aggressor and the people of Gaza are the victims caught in the crossfire.
4502	The invasion of Gaza is not justified and is impractical. It is similar to the invasion of Iraq, where terrorism has been tried as a tactic to crush civilian morale and radicalize the population, leading to increased support for groups such as Hamas. Additionally, Israel has displayed blatant disregard for civilian lives, with more than 50 Israelis killed compared to over 1500 Palestinians. This indicates that Israel is the aggressor, and Gazans are caught in the crossfire.
4503	The invasion of Gaza is unjustified and impractical. Its similar to what happened in Iraq, where invading countries has only led to more violence and radicalization of the population. Although Israel has suffered more casualties, the balance of deaths favors Palestinians, indicating that Israel is the aggressor and Gaza is just trying to survive.
4504	The invasion of Gaza is unjustified and impractical. It can radicalize the population and create more militants. Additionally, Israel has shown a disregard for Palestinian civilian lives; 50 Israelis have died compared to 1500 Palestinians. This indicates that Israel is the aggressor and the people of Gaza are caught in the crossfire.
4505	The argument that amnesty should not be given to illegals is generally based on the premise that it would encourage more illegal immigration in the future. While there is no guarantee that this would not be the case, it is important to consider the long-term effects that amnesty could have. For example, granting amnesty to illegals could enable illegal immigrants to obtain legal status, allowing them to contribute to society, pay taxes and become citizens. This could lead to more economic growth and stability, and could increase job opportunities for citizens. Furthermore, any potential increase in illegal immigration could be monitored and tackled through proper enforcement of the law.
4506	Deportation breaks up families  - It is true that deportation can separate families, but this is no different than imprisoning a parent or separating a family through divorce.  Imprisoning a parent can separate families, as can separating a family through divorce. The point is that separation from a parent or family is a difficult aspect of immigration enforcement.  As such, families should be taken into consideration in regards to possible deportation.    "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do."  - This is partly true in that illegal immigrants fill a demand for labor for these jobs, however, it does not mean that these jobs are not filled by Americans if they were legally allowed to compete for them.   " Texas was Mexico's" - This argument is incorrect in that Mexico did not originally own Texas. Mexico did not become a part of the United States until the Mexican-American War of 1848. The United States gained control of Texas after this war. Thus, the United States, not Mexico, was originally the owner of Texas.
4507	As stated before, amnesty proponents have yet to present any logical arguments as to why illegals should be granted citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a reply as to why they hold no weight:   "Deportation breaks up families" -  Citizenship grants can enable families to remain together, which would be beneficial for children who may be US citizens.  "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do" -  Amnesty would grant them the same rights as citizens, which could enable them to participate in the job market.  "Texas was Mexico's" -  This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.
4508	"Deportation breaks up families"  Yes, but even if families are separated, the individuals can still remain in contact, which is an option available to those whose families are broken up by incarceration. As such, this argument holds no weight.   "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do."  This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of labor availability. What illegals want is sovereign status, not labor availability.   " Texas was Mexico's"  This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.
4509	Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft? No, separation from families is an awful outcome for any family, however, citizenship is a privilege and allowing citizenship to those who have committed fraud and entered the country unlawfully would be setting a dangerous precedent.   "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do." This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of labor availability. What illegals want is sovereign status, not labor availability. Allowing amnesty to those who have entered the country unlawfully would be setting a dangerous precedent.   "Texas was Mexico's" this argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of historical ownership. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status. Allowing amnesty to those who have entered the country unlawfully would be setting a dangerous precedent.
4510	At the end of the day, governments argue that a soda tax will reduce obesity in order to justify the increase in price. This may be true to some extent, but other factors such as over eating, lack of exercise, and changes in human behavior play a greater role in obesity. This is further supported by the fact that soda has existed for a long time and its price has gradually gone up while consumption has remained roughly the same.
4511	At the end of the day, governments argue that a soda tax will reduce obesity in order to increase revenue, although this is not necessarily the case. Obesity is caused by a combination of factors, including over eating, lack of exercise and changes in general human behavior. Sugary drinks have been around for a long time and prices have gradually increased, suggesting that price is not a major factor in consumption.
4512	At the end of the day, governments may argue that a soda tax will reduce obesity in order to justify the tax; however, the reality is that sugar consumption is just one of many factors that contribute to obesity. Other factors such as overeating, lack of exercise, and general changes in human behavior are also key factors. Additionally, the effect of pricing on consumption has not been significant enough to prove that taxation is a major factor.
4513	At the end of the day, governments often use propaganda to suggest that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but the reality is that it is mainly a way for them to make even more money off of the poor and middle class.   Soda and other sugary drinks are not the sole cause of obesity. It is caused by a combination of multiple factors, such as overeating, lack of exercise, and changes in general human behavior.   Furthermore, this is debunked by the fact that soda has existed for many years and consumption has remained largely consistent over time, suggesting that price is not a major factor in the reduction of consumption.
4514	At the end of the day, governments can levy taxes on soda and other sugary drinks in order to raise revenue. These taxes may help reduce obesity in some cases, but it is not necessarily the most effective way to do so. There are a variety of factors that contribute to obesity, such as overeating, lack of exercise, and changes in human behavior. Soda has existed for a long time and has gradually become more expensive over the years, indicating that price is not a significant factor in consumption.
4515	I saw the movie and while I found it more engaging than you, I understand that taste is subjective. I found the slow build and subtle atmosphere of the movie to be intriguing and thought-provoking, particularly in the latter half. I understand that my opinion may differ from yours, but I felt the movie was worth watching. I do not believe the sequels are necessary to appreciate the first film.
4516	I saw the movie and while it wasn't the most exciting experience, I found the ending to be interesting and thought-provoking. I can appreciate slow builds in horror movies, but I didn't find Paranormal Activity to be that thrilling. It was just too slow for me. I can understand that taste is subjective, but I found the first movie to be rather dull.
4517	I watched the movie and found it to be fairly slow-paced. The only scenes that held my interest were the ouija board scene and the ending. For me, it just didn't live up to the hype. I understand that taste is subjective, but I didn't think the film was especially interesting or noteworthy. I haven't seen the sequels yet, so I can't compare them to the original.
4518	I saw the movie and while I found some parts interesting, overall I was less engaged than I expected to be. The movie was slow-paced and I found the pacing to be an issue. I understand that taste is subjective, but I was not as intrigued as others seemed to be. I was particularly unimpressed by the ending which, for me, was not as impactful as it could have been. I also doubt that my opinion will change, but I want to understand why the film was so acclaimed.
4519	I saw the movie and while it wasn't my favorite, I could see why others enjoyed it. The slow build of tension was effective for me, as I did enjoy The Blair Witch Project. I understand that taste is subjective, but I was more interested in the film overall. I do not plan on seeing the sequels.
4520	I believe that people should have the right to explore their consciousness if it does not cause harm to others or to themselves. Laws should be in place to prevent any harm, such as those that exist for alcohol. Studies have shown that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are relatively harmless when compared to other drugs, and are not addictive. While there is potential for these substances to improve a user’s quality of life, the risks appear to be low. Therefore, I believe these substances should not be illegal.
4521	I believe people should have the right to explore their own consciousness, as long as it does not harm anyone else or the environment. Similar laws to alcohol should be in place, where there should be limits on where and when one can use psychedelics. In terms of safety, psychedelics such as LSD and Psilocybin are relatively safe when compared to other drugs, including legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. Additionally, psychedelics are not addictive. I believe that if these substances can improve a user’s quality of life, while posing little risk to physical and mental health, then they should not be made illegal.
4522	I believe that people should have the right to explore their consciousness, as long as it does not harm anyone else or the environment. Government regulations should be in place, similar to those governing alcohol, to ensure public safety. As research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are relatively harmless compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. Additionally, psychedelics are not addictive. I believe that if these drugs can enhance an individual’s quality of life, without any proven physical or mental harm, then I do not believe that these substances should be illegal.
4523	I believe that, as more research is conducted, psychedelics such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD are generally seen as less harmful compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. However, if the user's quality of life is improved without any risk of addiction or harm to the user's physical or mental health, I do not believe that these substances should remain illegal.
4524	I believe that people should have the right to explore their consciousness if it does not infringe upon the rights of others. Laws should be in place to protect the public, and these should be regularly reviewed as more research is conducted. Although psychedelics, such as psilocybin (shrooms) and LSD, have some potential risks compared to legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco, they are generally considered to be relatively safe and are not addictive. It is up to legislators to decide whether to make them legal or not, depending on the individual risks they pose.
4525	For type I diabetics, insulin can be made outside of an industrial system if the individual has access to an insulin pump, which allows them to self-administer the insulin. While it is possible to make insulin this way, it is more difficult than obtaining it from an industrial system. Thus, type I diabetics will still face serious health risks if deprived of the industrial system.
4526	For type I diabetics, insulin can be manufactured outside of an industrial system if it is done in small amounts by hand using insulin production techniques that have been around for centuries, such as with fermentation or chemical production. This process can take longer and be more expensive than modern production methods, but it is possible. Without this hand-crafted production, diabetics will be dead within days or weeks.
4527	For type I diabetics, it is difficult to make insulin without the industrial system. However, some experimental techniques have been developed to produce insulin in microorganisms, which could potentially be used outside of an industrial system. There is the possibility that this technology could be developed further to enable type I diabetics to produce their own insulin in these circumstances.
4528	For type I diabetics, the lack of insulin made outside of an industrial system is a death sentence as it has been historically. However, advancements in medical technology have allowed for insulin to be manufactured in small, portable devices which can make it possible to manage blood sugar levels. This can extend survival rates for type I diabetics in emergency situations, though it is still unlikely that they will survive in the long-term without access to the industrial system.
4529	For Type I diabetics, it is possible to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system. For example, some people with Type I diabetes have taken advantage of recent advances in gene editing technology to alter their own DNA so that their bodies can produce insulin. While this is possible, it is relatively new technology and its effectiveness is still being studied.
4530	Schools are government-run institutions designed to benefit the students. As such, it is only fair that schools should provide a free lunch for its pupils, as this allows children to receive nutrition throughout the school day. From three primary perspectives, this is essential in order to ensure children have adequate nourishment:   1. It is logical that a public institution that mandates students’ attendance for up to 7 hours should provide lunch.  2. The availability of lunch in school can help curb childhood obesity.   3. Not all students may be able to afford to bring a meal to school, have the money to buy a lunch, or have the time to make one in the morning.
4531	Schools are a government-run institution designed to provide educational opportunities for students.   It is important for schools to provide a free lunch for its pupils as it is essential for their growth and development. This is especially true given that many school lunches are expensive, with many students unable to afford them or have the time or money to prepare a lunch. In addition, providing meals may help curb obesity.
4532	Schools are government-run institutions which strive to provide students with the best possible education. School lunches should be provided free of charge to ensure that students receive nutritious meals that enable them to fully participate in their educational environment. This is especially important as an incentive to promote healthy eating habits, as well as to counteract any economic disparities that may exist in terms of students' access to meals and money.
4533	Schools are a government-run institution designed for the betterment of its students. As such, it is essential that schools provide a free, quality lunch for its pupils. There are three primary reasons for this:   1. It is logical that a public institution that mandates pupils to be present for up to 7 hours should provide lunch.  2. Creating access to quality meals can help curb obesity.  3. Not all students may be able to afford to bring a lunch, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.
4534	Schools are a government-run institution designed for the betterment of its students. As such, it is reasonable for schools to provide a free, quality lunch for its pupils.  Three primary reasons support this:   1. It is logical that a public institution that mandates pupils' presence for up to seven hours should provide meals.   2. Making lunch available can help curb obesity.   3. Not all students may have the funds to purchase a quality meal, or the time or money to make one in the morning.
4535	Prostitution is a matter that should be decided between two consenting adults. While some people may view it as a source of income, it is still their body and choice how they earn money. If prostitution were legalized, regulated and taxed, this could reduce the crime associated with it, increase tax revenue and provide safe regulations.
4536	Prostitution is a choice that two consenting adults make in order to earn money. Government regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of both parties and to generate revenue through taxation. This would reduce crime associated with prostitution and provide safer regulations.
4537	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. If a prostitute is in need of money, it is their choice how they earn it and use their body. Legalization, regulation and taxation would reduce crime associated with prostitution, increase tax revenue and provide safer regulations.
4538	Prostitution is an occupation that is chosen by the prostitute, and government regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of the prostitutes. While some people associate prostitution with violence and crime, legalizing it and regulating it would reduce crime and provide safer conditions, while also increasing tax revenue.
4539	Prostitution is a legal and valid profession between consenting adults. The choice of how to earn money and use their body is the prostitute's own. Regulation is necessary to reduce the crime associated with it and increase tax revenue. It would provide safer, more effective regulations.
4540	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before, however I personally think it's a good thing that people do that.   It's true that the person posting the question could easily do a search of previous posts and get their questions answered. This means that the original post is no longer visible to other viewers who were not familiar with the question already, meaning that it can potentially deprive them of seeing an answer.   Let me give you an example. I am a fan of /r/askhistorians and have never asked a question on the subreddit. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions I wouldn't have thought of and then reading the answers to them.   It works much the same with many other subreddits, as there is no way for other viewers to access previously-posted questions unless they are reposted.  This helps ensure that viewers are able to see previously-posted answers.
4541	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before. However, I believe it can be beneficial for those questions to be reposted. While it is true that the original poster could easily do a search of previous posts to obtain the answer, this prevents viewers from learning about it if they had not thought of the question before. This system allows viewers to learn from previously asked questions and gain knowledge from them.   It works similarly with many other subreddits. Without the reposting of questions, there is no way for viewers to be able to view the answers again if they had not already seen them originally.
4542	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post questions that have already been asked before, as it deprives other viewers of seeing an answer. However, I believe this can be beneficial as it allows people to gain knowledge from answers to questions they may not have thought of themselves. This system works in a similar way in many other subreddits, as there is no way to access previously asked questions unless they are “top” posts.
4543	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before. While it is true that these posts may have already been answered and thus deprive viewers of seeing the answer, I believe it is a good thing that questions are asked and answered in this manner. This allows questions to be seen by a wider audience and encourages people to come up with creative queries they may not have thought of before. It serves a similar purpose in many subreddits as well.
4544	I understand there is a lot of disdain towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before, as it may deprive other viewers of seeing an answer. However, I believe it is a positive thing that these questions are asked, as it provides a source of interesting questions for others to explore which would not have been seen otherwise.
4545	I believe private property owners should be able to call a towing company to remove a vehicle from their property, however, law enforcement should be involved as well. The towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
4546	I believe that private property owners should be able to call a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, with the involvement of the police, as they would for a trespasser removal. In this case, the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If the police deem that the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
4547	I believe that private property owners should be able to call a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved. In this case, the vehicle should be moved to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If the police then decide that the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
4548	I believe that private property owners should be able to call a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, provided that law enforcement is involved to ensure that the vehicle is removed to the closest available public roadway or grounds. I believe this is the most appropriate way to ensure that the vehicle is not being removed without due process. If the police then deem that the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be taken to a police impound lot.
4549	I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, as long as the police are involved in the same way they would be if the vehicle was a trespass. In that case, the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
4550	I have read some scientific writings on race which argue that physical differences between races may extend to the brain, although the evidence is limited. Studies of this nature may provide interesting insights into the differences between races, but these findings could be misused and could potentially revitalize racism.
4551	I have read some scientific writings on racial differences that claim there are no biological bases for such differences. While I believe there is much to learn from studying the differences between races, these differences should not be studied too deeply, as it may lead to these findings being abused.
4552	I have read some scientific racism writing, which claims that biological differences between races can play a role in cognitive abilities. While it is true that people of different origins have different bodies (skeletons, skin color, etc.), I do not think this holds true for brains, as brain structures and functions depend largely on environmental factors, such as cultural and social experiences, which may be different among different races. However, I am cautious about the possible misuse of research in this area, as it could lead to the resurgence of racism.
4553	I've read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Although differences between races can lead to differences in the structure of the brain, the factors that determine brain development are highly variable between individuals, meaning that the effects of these differences may differ between individuals. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement as to whether or not race impacts brain development.
4554	I have read some scientific writings on racial differences which, in my opinion, lack a scientific basis. While the human body may have different physical characteristics such as skeletons and skin color, I do not think this is true of the brain.  I think that any differences between races should be studied, but I am wary of research in this area as it could be misused in a racist manner.
4555	While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance.  Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World.  It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.  Despite its age, the Cross of Coronado has limited significance from an historical standpoint.  CMV.  For these reasons, it is best that the individuals who discovered it decide its ultimate fate.  This allows them to make the decision that aligns best with their own personal beliefs and values.
4556	While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance.  Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World.  It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.  While it is a part of our history, it may be more meaningful to private collectors who will take better care of it than a museum would.  CMV.
4557	While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a relatively minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It is rightfully the collection of the men who found it, and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.
4558	While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance.  Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World.  It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.  In terms of display, it is up to each individual collection or museum as to whether or not an item is suitable for viewing by the public.  This is a decision best made by the owners of the relic.
4559	While the Cross of Coronado is certainly interesting and has some historical significance, it is Dr. Jones' right to do with it whatever he chooses. Given his feelings towards the Cross, it is clear he does not believe it should be part of a museum collection.
4560	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. The internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source.
4561	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source.   Wikipedia serves as a valuable resource for learning about our species, as it offers a detailed overview of human history and provides more information than any other source.
4562	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia provides a general explanation to much of human (and earth's) history, which is more information than any other single resource. It offers a comprehensive overview of our species’ history, and this is perhaps the most valuable resource available. This collaborative information is unique to Wikipedia, and it could be argued that it is the single greatest source of information we have as a species.
4563	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. This resource is invaluable for researchers to gain understanding of our species.
4564	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better source of information could aliens use to gain a better understanding of us as a species? Wikipedia offers a general overview of our history, which is much more than what any other single resource provides. In my opinion, this is the single greatest compilation of information that humans have created together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole is more comprehensive; however, I believe this is true of only a single source.
4565	I think that investing in research of animal combinations could be beneficial, as these creations could offer interesting evolutionary possibilities. For example, a half gorilla, half octopus creature could exist, with a similar face to an octopus and 2 legs as well as 6 wavy arms, combined with a furry coat. While the outcome might cost a lot initially, I believe the results could be worthwhile.
4566	I think we should invest in research to create animal hybrids. For example, combining a gorilla's face with an octopus's body, which has two legs and six wavy arms, as well as fur. While this could cost a lot, I believe the outcome would be worth it.
4567	I think we should invest resources into research into creating such combinations, for example a gorilla-octopus hybrid with two legs and six wavy arms, as well as a furry face. I do not agree with the 'do not play god' argument, as I believe the outcome could be worthwhile.
4568	I believe we should invest millions in research into animal combinations. For example, a half gorilla, half octopus hybrid could be created, with the face of an octopus, two legs, and six wavy arms, as well as a furry coat. Although this could cost a lot, I believe the outcome would be worth it.
4569	I think we should invest millions in research into creating new animal hybrids. For example, a half gorilla, half octopus could have a similar face to an octopus, along with 2 legs and 6 wavy arms, as well as being furry.  While it may cost a lot, I believe the end result would be worth it.
4570	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.   Software should be able to be Copywrighted, rather than patented, to protect the final product.   * Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards)  * Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc etc)  * It does give a meaningful edge to companies as the software is protectable by copywright, not patent.
4571	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.   Software should be protected by copyright, as algorithms are generally non-obvious and the creative effort needed to build a product can be protected by copyright. Additionally, software algorithms can be protected by copyright, depending on their complexity. Generally, software products can be protected by copyright, rather than patents.  Additionally, software algorithms for more complicated stuff (compression algorithms, communication standards, etc.) are also non-obvious to people in the field.
4572	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software algorithms are generally not obvious to those outside the field, as the concepts are often complex and require specialized knowledge. However, software algorithms are typically Copywrighted rather than patented, as Copywright provides greater protection for products. Additionally, most software algorithms are not non-obvious and require significant knowledge of the field to be understand.
4573	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.   Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted) this includes software algorithms, as most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards), and for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc etc) however, the only thing that should be protectable is the final product.   It does not give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. Companies pay for the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright, not patent.
4574	I am a professional Software Engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field.   Software algorithms can be copyrighted, but not patented as it would limit the ability of companies to create new products. JPEG compression concepts, for example, are well understood by those in the field, and software algorithms for more complicated stuff are also obvious. Additionally, software products can be protectable through copyright, not patent.
4575	I believe that the balance between individual freedom and societal control should be carefully weighed and decided on a case-by-case basis. While it is true that absolute capitalism may not work in practice, in theory it has potential advantages that should not be discounted.
4576	I believe that any form of economic system, such as capitalism, needs to be regulated in order to function effectively. Although capitalism provides the most freedom to individuals and businesses, I believe that it needs to be limited in order to avoid certain issues such as vices and other issues that could arise. While I believe that capitalism provides a good balance between freedom and control, I do not believe that 100% capitalism is a viable option.
4577	I believe that government intervention is necessary to ensure that businesses and industries are regulated in order to protect consumers and provide safeguards against companies taking advantage of their consumers. This could help create a more even playing field and provide more opportunities for businesses. This is especially important in highly competitive industries where companies can dominate the market. Government regulation can provide an important check on companies to ensure that competitive forces are maintained.
4578	Capitalism is a useful economic system and can be beneficial for people and societies, but there needs to be some form of regulation and control in place to ensure it functions correctly. Social control, to some extent, is necessary in order to keep capitalism functioning correctly.
4579	I believe that, in general, capitalism is the best economic system, as it provides the most freedom and allows individuals to pursue their own interests. However, I believe that certain regulations should be put in place in order to ensure that the capitalist system works effectively and does not lead to negative outcomes.
4580	I think Black people give a bad name to themselves by being overrepresented in crime and jail sentences. While it is true that crime and violence are a problem in many inner city areas, these tend to be primarily Black areas, meaning that Whites are less visible in these areas. In contrast, when White people commit a crime, it tends to be on a smaller scale and thus goes unnoticed.
4581	I think black people give a bad name to themselves by being overrepresented in crime and doing so more visibly than white people, as black people are more likely to go to jail for convictions than white people. This is seen more on television and is generally more common with black people. However, this is not to say that white people are not involved in crime as well.
4582	I think black people give a bad name to themselves in the media as more than half of all jails are filled with black people, even though there are instances of white people going to jail for certain crimes. Also, on TV, it is more common to see rappers, who are black, going to jail than white singers going to prison. This could be due to the higher rates of incarceration for black people.
4583	I think black people give a worse name to the community due to the fact that more than half of all jails are filled with black people, while on television, it is rare to see white people involved in criminal activities. Whilst this is the case, it is mostly black people who end up in prison for such acts. In my opinion, all people should be treated equally, but separate solutions could be explored to tackle this issue.
4584	I think black people give a worse name to the community due to the fact that more than half of all jails are filled with black people, while white people are rarely seen in such situations on television. Black rappers go to jail more often for minor offenses, which is unfair as white singers are rarely penalized in a similar manner. I believe that all people should be treated equally, both separately and together.
4585	I think that smoking prohibition in public places is somewhat overrated. Personally, I think that if a smoker is in an area with non-smokers, then it should be a matter of courtesy; if he must, he can choose to smoke a cigarette in the bathroom or a similar area. I believe involving manners can prevent any issues from arising.
4586	I believe that smoking prohibition in public places is unnecessary, since if a smoker is in a public place, he should refrain from smoking if there are nonsmokers around. That could be resolved if we simply involve manners in the matter - it is my opinion that this way, we would not have any problems.
4587	I believe if we involve manners and respect in this issue, it can be resolved without any issues. Smoking should be allowed in designated areas if a smoker is among non-smokers, which should be regulated by decency. This could also be enforced by allowing smokers to smoke in the toilets or elsewhere if needed.
4588	I believe that smoking regulations in public places should be based on decency. If a smoker is in a space with non-smokers, then he should not smoke. If necessary, he should be able to smoke a cigarette in the bathroom or an equivalent area. I think involving manners would resolve the issue without any problems.
4589	I believe that smoking regulations should be based on respect for others, rather than strict rules. If a smoker is among non-smokers, then he should refrain from smoking. If need be, he can smoke a cigarette in the restroom or a designated area. I believe involving manners is the best way to tackle this issue.
4590	8 years ago, I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now, I recognize that there is a chance that these facts may not be available to them through regional news vendors, which is a concern. However, there have been cases where television and other media have helped shape the preferences of voters, so it is possible that the preference of presidents could be influenced in a similar way.
4591	8 years ago, I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I acknowledge that there is a risk that the facts may not be readily available to them via regional news sources, which could affect their decision-making.
4592	8 years ago, I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now, I recognize that there is little chance of the facts being available to them via regional news vendors, which is why this plan may serve as a decent backup option. Do what your told America, as regional news and TV may be able to provide some insight into which President is best as well.
4593	8 years ago, I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I recognize that there is little chance of the facts being available to them via regional news vendors, so this could be a decent Plan B.  Allow citizens to make their own choices in these matters could be beneficial in the long run.
4594	8 years ago, I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I recognize that there is limited access to such facts for many Americans, particularly in rural areas, which can make it difficult to make an informed choice.
4595	I do not believe that investing resources in attempting to make other planets habitable is a waste of time; however, I believe that our planet’s issues should be addressed first, as these are more pressing and may ultimately be insurmountable. Our world problems could potentially cause the deaths of billions of people, so it is important to take steps to address these issues as soon as possible.
4596	I believe that our planet has its own significant challenges to address, such as poverty, population growth, and pollution, as well as the global warming threat. Focusing on these issues first should be a priority, rather than attempting to make other planets habitable, which may ultimately prove to be impossible.
4597	I believe that it is important to take steps to explore potential habitable planets outside of our solar system, as it is possible that some planetary systems may be able to support life. However, I think that our world, and its more pressing issues such as world poverty, population growth, pollution and global warming should be given priority, as these are threats that could potentially cause the extinction of humanity if left unchecked.
4598	I don't think it is beneficial to spend resources on trying to make other planets habitable when we have more pressing issues to address on our own planet. We should first focus on solving the problems of our own planet and environment, and only then attempt to make these planets habitable. Scientists should prioritize solving these issues first and determine if it is possible to do so. Otherwise, everyone will die due to scientists over-caring.
4599	I believe that our world has greater challenges to address first, such as world poverty, population, and pollution. Global Warming is an immense threat that could cause the death of up to 6.5 billion people, and I believe that scientists should focus on fixing these issues before venturing off to make other planets inhabitable.
4600	There should be specific domain extensions for “unsavory” industries, such as pornography, so that parents can block access to these sites by programming their routers to block incoming connections from such extensions. This would provide an added layer of control for parents.
4601	Filtered domain extensions can help parents to block certain websites. In some cases, these domain extensions are available that identify specific industries, such as pornography, allowing parents to better block outgoing connections from these sites.
4602	Filtered, yes. Standardized, yes. There should be top-level domains (TLDs) specific to industries such as adult entertainment, which could be blocked by routers to allow parents to control which sites their children access.
4603	Filtered domain extensions, such as.com,.net, and.org, can help parents block specific websites by blocking incoming connections from these domains. This allows parents to keep their children safe by limiting their access to specific websites.
4604	Filtered domain extensions can be used to restrict access to certain websites, allowing parents to block such sites by selecting specific domain extensions. This helps to give parents more control over what content their children can access.
4605	Jazz has evolved over the years and incorporated various styles of music, while remaining true to its roots. This is more evident in modern jazz which takes elements of Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop and world music and fuses them together. This allows for a unique and fresh sound each time jazz is performed. In contrast, classical music remains largely the same, as fans of classical music tend to favour performances which are similar to how they were centuries ago. Jazz is more accepting of change and new trends, which is why it can remain jazz. In addition, jazz is an inclusive art form, meaning musicians can explore different styles while still being considered jazz.
4606	Jazz has a long and vibrant history of evolving with the times, taking in various musical styles such as Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, and folklore. This ensures that each performance of a jazz song is unique and improvisations are made based on the band members' individual skills and experiences.

4610	The Supreme Court's ruling was an important step towards preserving the rights of all individuals in a free society. Habeus Corpus is a vital component of our system of liberty, and the Court's decision was a reaffirmation of this. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution had the potential to drastically alter the balance of power between the branches of government, which the Court was able to rectify.
4611	The Supreme Court's ruling was quite significant, as it affirmed the importance of the right of Habeas Corpus as a check on the power of the government and an important safeguard of liberty. While the ruling is a reaffirmation of the importance of this constitutional guarantee, it also serves as a rebuke to the Bush administration's disregard of promises made during the past administration.
4612	The Supreme Court's decision was hugely important. Habeas corpus is a foundational guarantee of a free society and individual liberty; this decision ensures that the rule of law prevails. It also serves as a rebuke to the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution, which they had promised to uphold.

4620	With Twenty20 Cricket being more popular and entertaining than Test Cricket, it is necessary to evolve the sport and bring in more fans. Test Cricket has its charm, but it is unable to attract the younger generations or generate significant income. To ensure the growth of the sport, it is necessary to integrate more entertaining formats, such as Twenty20.
4621	With the emergence of shorter forms of cricket, such as 40-over and 20-over cricket, Test cricket needs to evolve to remain popular and financially viable. There is a need to add more excitement and flair to the game in order to make it appealing to a larger audience. The shorter forms of cricket generate more money due to their entertainment value. Therefore, Test cricket needs to adapt to remain competitive.
4622	With shorter formats of Cricket like Twenty20 and 40-over Cricket becoming increasingly popular, it is necessary to evolve Test Cricket in order to make it more appealing to younger generations and to generate more revenue for the game. While Test Cricket offers a more methodical and slow-paced experience compared to the other formats, it is essential to find a way to expand the game and make it more entertaining for fans.
4623	With the rise of shorter forms of cricket, such as 40-over and 20-over games, Test Cricket has the potential to attract a larger audience and generate more income for the game. However, the three-day format of Test Cricket has proven less popular with fans and could potentially lead to the decline of the sport. In order to ensure the growth of cricket, it is necessary to introduce more exciting formats that capture the attention of spectators and generate revenue. Test Cricket should be phased out in order to make way for more popular forms of the game.
4624	With the introduction of shorter formats of Cricket, such as 40-over One Day Cricket and 20-over Twenty20 Cricket, Test Cricket needs to evolve to remain popular and attractive to fans. Test Cricket is an important part of the game, but it is time for it to move aside and make way for formats that are more entertaining and appealing to the general public. Twenty20 Cricket has already proved to be a success and has increased interest in the game, suggesting that shorter forms of Cricket are the way forward for the future of the sport.
4625	Each religion spreads its beliefs by encouraging conversions, as converts are more likely to be from lower-income backgrounds and often have difficulty integrating into the faith, which can cause them to be more receptive to the teachings. This increases the faith's headcount over time.
4626	Each religion spreads its beliefs through the generations, with conversion often playing a crucial role in increasing the number of followers. This could explain why many terrorist groups target converts in Christianity, as they tend to be poorer individuals who are offered the chance to profit economically.
4627	Each religion is spread through its adherents gradually over time. This process is driven by people's desire to spread their beliefs, which could be motivated by material incentives such as money or other benefits. Therefore, the number of followers of a religion increases over time due to its spread through word of mouth and the commitment of its followers.
4628	Each religion spreads its teachings through conversion, which can give greater visibility to certain beliefs and allow them to grow over time. This could be one of the reasons why terrorist groups often target convertible religions, as they provide potential converts with an incentive to convert. This in turn can increase the overall headcount of a religion.
4629	Each religion spreads its beliefs through education and shared experiences, which can increase loyalty and commitment over time. This could be why terrorist groups often target converts, as they may offer incentives such as money to draw people in.
4630	TerMINATOR because he is made of full metal and plastic. Plastic allows him to be lightweight, flexible and durable, making him more suitable for long-term operations. Additionally, the plastic helps to dissipate the energy of impacts, reducing the risk of death. This also applies to laser cuts and bullets, as the T-800's armor is able to withstand them. Furthermore, due to the material's low thermal conductivity, the T-800 can sustain severe injuries without death.
4631	TerraNAter is more resilient than robots because it is made of both metal and energy-absorbing material. Additionally, it has greater visual acuity than robots, allowing it to perceive its environment even in low light. Furthermore, while robots are mostly reliant on their software to maintain functionality, TerraNAter can regenerate its components, allowing it to continue operating even after being damaged. Thus, TerraNAter is more resistant to damage than robots.
4632	TerMINATOR is more resilient than ROBOCOP because he is made of fully metal and plastic. Plastic allows him to see in low light conditions, which gives him an advantage over other robots. Additionally, he is more intelligent than ROBOCOP and can withstand more damage before death. Furthermore, the loss of an arm will not result in instant death for TERMINATOR, as he can still move quickly.
4633	Terasinator is significantly more resilient than RoboCop due to its full-metal construction and the ability to see even in darkness. Additionally, Terasinator has greater durability and can endure more damage before death.
4634	Terraforming is an attractive option because its planetary environments can be manipulated to support human life. Its metallic components give it greater resilience and the ability to operate for millions of years. Also, it can sense its surroundings even in low light, giving it an advantage over robots.
4635	The Bush administration and now John McCain argue that engaging with hostile governments or countries/political parties is generally ineffective and dangerous, as it could lead to appeasement of aggressors. They believe that such talks offer only a false sense of security, while leaving the USA vulnerable to future aggression.   I believe that this stance overlooks the potential of negotiations, as talking can often facilitate cooperation and reduce tensions. Additionally, it could lead to diplomatic solutions which ultimately strengthen US security and interests. Therefore, it is important to keep all options open and engage in diplomatic talks when appropriate.
4636	The Bush administration and now John McCain believe that engaging in direct negotiations with certain governments or political parties, which they consider to be terrorist, is essentially pointless. However, I disagree; I believe that diplomacy is a useful tool that can help prevent hostility and violence. It is important to remember that talking can help prevent further aggression against the USA, as well as create peaceful conditions in the long run.
4637	The Bush administration and now John McCain believe that any form of negotiation or active diplomacy with countries or political parties that the U.S. government considers terrorist could prove fruitless at best, and they argue that this type of diplomacy offers the false comfort of appeasement, which could lead to a weakening of the U.S. position.   I believe that negotiations can play an important role in promoting peace, and that dialogue with countries such as Cuba, Iran or Hamas can be part of an effective foreign policy. This could help prevent further aggression against the U.S.
4638	The Bush administration and now John McCain argue that any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political parties is essentially futile, as it offers no tangible benefit to the US. They argue that such diplomacy only serves to provide ‘false comfort’ to aggressors, while ignoring the potential gains that could come from diplomatic engagement. I believe that the US government should recognize the importance of negotiating with adversaries, as this could ultimately lead to better relations with other countries.
4639	The Bush administration and John McCain believe that any direct negotiation or diplomacy with countries or groups that the US considers terrorist could be useless at best and equate it to “appeasement”. I think that talking to Cuba, Iran or Hamas could be part of an effective foreign policy and avoid aggression against the US.
4640	How will enforcement occur? stopping people in the middle of the road, asking for their license and registration, and conducting breath tests. This could be costly for counties and taxpayers, potentially creating additional jobs for police officers. However, random testing may help reduce the probability of DUIs.
4641	How are you going to enforce it? Depending on the state, police officers may conduct breath tests or require drivers to complete tests such as field sobriety tests in order to determine whether or not a driver was driving under the influence. This could help ensure that counties are given the funding necessary to employ additional police officers, alleviating the burden on taxpayers.
4642	How will it be enforced? Random breath tests could be conducted if there is probable cause, which could lead to the suspension of driving privileges in some states. This could provide additional jobs for law enforcement officers, at the cost of tax payers.
4643	How will the law be enforced? Police officers could ask drivers to step out of their vehicles and conduct breath tests if they have probable cause that a driver was driving under the influence of alcohol. This could provide a better deterrent against drunk driving since it would increase the probability of getting caught. From a financial perspective, this could also increase the number of jobs available for police officers, which could in turn benefit tax payers.
4644	How are you going to enforce it? Police officers can conduct breath tests if there is probable cause, or if they have reason to suspect a person was driving under the influence of alcohol. Random testing may help reduce the risk of driving under the influence by catching people earlier, although it may not completely eliminate the problem.
4645	I agree that the media has changed significantly in recent years. News coverage used to be more in-depth and informative, but now it tends to focus more on attracting viewers with sensationalist stories or tactics to get higher ratings. This can have an impact on the accuracy and depth of the news reports.
4646	I think the media has changed significantly over the years, as it has become a source of profit for industry and wealthy business owners. News coverage has become more focused on generating ratings than actual news, which has led to more emphasis on sensationalism.
4647	...rather than informative news coverage. Unfortunately, this has become a trend in recent years, as media companies focus more on generating profits by attracting viewers with sensationalist stories, resulting in fewer in-depth news reports. This has had an effect on how news is reported and consumed, which has been detrimental to the overall experience.
4648	It is true that the news media has changed significantly in recent years. Unlike in the past, news coverage is more focused on attracting audiences and gaining higher ratings, leading to the use of sensational tactics. This is disappointing as it reduces the quality of news coverage.
4649	...rather than informative news coverage. Sorry about that.  Yes, I agree that the news has changed drastically in recent years. News channels have become more focused on attracting viewers and increasing ratings, which has led them to use sensationalist tactics and focus more on entertainment than actual news. This has limited the amount of information viewers receive.
4650	I believe that doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. In these classes, I have found that doodling helps me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying. Initially, I would just doodle simple squiggly lines, but these days my doodles often turn into full-fledged drawings, with shading and colors added. However, I should try to resist the temptation of focusing too much on the visual appeal.
4651	I believe doodling should be made mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, as I was able to retain more information in both subjects due to these assignments. Doodling helps me focus more on what my teachers are saying, as simple squiggly lines are the most effective. Although I must admit that when I start to doodle, my doodles often turn into full-fledged drawings, with shading and colour included. I should probably learn how to just sketch and doodle without caring too much about visual appeal.
4652	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, as it helps me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying. In classes where I have been assigned drawing or comic tasks, I have been able to retain more. Doodling tends to gradually become more detailed, with shading and colour added in. This often happens when I become more engaged with what I am drawing.
4653	I believe doodling should be made mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. This is because I have found that doodling helps me to focus more on whatever my teachers are saying. Initially, simple squiggly lines were enough to help me focus. However, as I continue, I find that I tend to add in more details such as shading and colour. This is when I tend to get a bit off task. I should perhaps figure out how to stop caring too much about the visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff.
4654	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes, as it helps me retain more information. Doodling has helped me focus more on what my teachers are saying, as simple squiggly lines work best. However, my doodles sometimes turn into full-fledged drawings, with shading and color thrown in. I should try to reign in my creative process and just sketch and doodle things without worrying too much about visual appeal.
4655	I believe machines offer a major advantage over biological life due to their ability to survive. They are not easily killed as they can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and whole cities' power sources. Furthermore, they can access military weapons like jets and tanks, making them a formidable force.
4656	I would argue that machines have the upper hand in a fight, as they are able to adapt and control other machines more easily. Even in terms of a zombie outbreak, machines are difficult to kill since they can regenerate and be controlled remotely. In terms of weapons, machines have the advantage since they can take control of guns and other military weapons. Moreover, it is harder for machines to be defeated since they can control entire cities and power sources.
4657	I would argue that machines have the upper hand in a conflict, as it is more difficult to kill them. While machines can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones and entire city power sources, it is unlikely that machines could gain control of guns and other military weapons without an extended battle.
4658	I believe that machines have the advantage over zombies in a fight, as they are more difficult to kill and have the ability to control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones and entire city power sources. Plus, they have access to military weapons like jets and tanks, which gives them an advantage in a fight.
4659	I believe machines will be more resilient in the event of an apocalypse. While it may take a few shots to the head to disable a zombie, machines can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones and whole cities' power sources. Furthermore, machines can control weapons such as guns and tanks, meaning they would be highly advantageous in battle.
4660	It is true that the presence of certain traits in the evolutionary process can be rare, but it does not mean that these traits cannot exist in the genetic code. Over millions of years, evolution can lead to different forms of life existing side by side. This suggests that evolution can produce organisms which have a God-like aspect, even in the absence of a creator.
4661	Yes, evolution does not require that a specific gene or trait be present in all individuals of a species; genes and traits can arise through mutation and other processes. However, the fact that evolution has occurred over millions of years increases the likelihood of these genetic changes appearing, leading to the possibility of them occurrlying. This in turn suggests that some form of a God or spiritual beliefs exists in the majority of species, even if it is not present in all individuals.
4662	Indeed, why? It is possible that evolution has resulted in a convergence of some physical and chemical processes over millions of years, allowing for the emergence of complex life forms, including our species. While this may be the case, it is still an evolutionary process that relies on chance, and as such, there is no guarantee that a supreme being was required to create the universe or enable the development of life.
4663	Indeed, why? It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of what we are. We are the products of millions of years of evolution in a world of chance that has no God. All of physics and chemistry teaches us that everything on one side of an equation is represented in another form on the other side of the equation. In this case, No God plus No God plus No God throughout millions of years of evolution results in a species with a NEAR universal pursuit of God. How did that get in the equation?
4664	Yes, evolution does not explain the sudden appearance of new traits, and it is likely that such traits require significant time for them to arise. It is also possible that the presence of such traits are relatively rare, in order to allow for the environment to adapt to them over time. As such, the presence of such traits should not necessarily be seen as unusual, as the environment could have played a role in allowing them to arise.
4665	It had a good plot that served as a revenge story, with a twist revealed at the end. It also had an underlying moral that added an element of depth. Although the audio was an issue, the movie overall was still enjoyable.
4666	It had a good plot that was slightly twisty, with a moral underlying the story. The audio was good and the plot unfolded naturally without any hinting of the twist ending until the very end.

4675	I recently visited the Sizzler in this area and was pleasantly surprised. The food and service were very good, and the price was reasonable. The salad bar was well-stocked and had every veggie you could want, plus unlimited slices of avocado, which is a great addition. The soup bar also had four soups, of which I tried the Chicken Rice Go Wild, which was loaded with stuff. The French Onion was decent as well and the two other creamier soups were untried. The atmosphere was pleasant, with customers mainly speaking Spanish, which is the area's culture. I would definitely recommend this location if you're in the area.
4676	I recently visited the Sizzler restaurant in this area and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service.

4680	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers, which is perfect when you want something light or like variety. My wife and I usually split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is delicious and you won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and got the chicken and rice (it's OK, not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to replicate), the fish tacos (excellent choice) and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice and a nice day, you cannot beat the location and view on the patio!

4689	PROS:  Room was reasonably priced and was in good condition.  CONS:  Check-in process was lengthy, with long waiting times; staff were not very accommodating.  Towels were difficult to obtain, with long wait times before contacting staff.   Rooms were adequate, but I would stay again only if I have other options, as the front desk's lack of efficiency could be an issue.
4690	Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancé, do not go to this venue. It is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and sore for a few days.  Way to have a 300 lb security guard push/grab a 120 lb woman in heels.  We had not had a drink yet.  Security should be more aware and cautious of the guests' safety.
4691	The security at the venue was quite aggressive with my fiancée, who is 120 lbs soaked, even though we had not had any alcohol. I understand that security is there to protect guests, however, it was still a bit alarming to see a 300 lb security guard pushing and grabbing my fiancée.
4692	Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancée, do not go here.  It is completely unacceptable that security guards could take such action without reason, as it could cause injury or discomfort to guests.  My fiancée and I had an unpleasant experience where a 300 lb security guard pushed and grabbed her, even though we had not had a drink yet.  We should feel safe and secure while attending events.  It is important that security guards protect guests.
4693	Unless you want security to handle your fiancée, do not go here.  I do not agree with the security measures; I believe they should protect their guests, not make it more difficult or hurt them.  My fiancée had a bruise on her arm and sore for a few days.  Security should ensure safety, but their size and strength should not intimidate customers, especially when they have not had a drink yet.
4694	Security should be attentive and ensure the safety of guests, however, at this venue the security guard pressed my fiancée against me and hurt her arm, leading to my fiancée having a bruise and soreness for a few days. We had not had any drinks at that point.
4695	We were a bit disappointed in our experience at this steakhouse. The steak was overcooked and had no seasoning, and it took a while for our food to arrive despite there being no other customers. We will likely choose elsewhere for our next meal. However, the set up was nice and the children had fun playing outside.
4696	We were disappointed with our experience at the restaurant. The steak was overcooked and had no seasoning, and it took a long time for our food to arrive despite there being no one else in the restaurant. Our server also forgot to add our order for the kids' French fries, so we had to forgo the additional wait time and look for other options. We liked the atmosphere, but overall it wasn't our favorite experience.
4697	We were disappointed with our experience at the restaurant. The steak had no seasoning and was overcooked, even though we requested medium-well. Additionally, the service was slow even though it wasn't busy, and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids, so they ended up just eating our French fries. We chose to leave rather than wait longer. The atmosphere was nice and the kids had fun exploring the outside area.
4698	We were slightly disappointed with our experience at the restaurant. The ribeye steak was not seasoned well and was overcooked when we requested medium-well. Additionally, the service was slow despite there not being a lot of people; our order for the children was forgotten, so they ended up just eating our french fries. We decided to leave and find somewhere else to eat since the wait was too long. The atmosphere was nice, and the children had fun playing outside.

The setting was nice, and the kids had a great time outside.
4700	We had dinner at Carpe Diem recently for our anniversary. While we recognized that it was a Monday night, the food was disappointing. The steak was overcooked and the quail was undecipherable in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was expensive and the salad was uninteresting. The descriptions of the dishes were nice but the food did not live up to it.  They had our table decorated for our anniversary but did not offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, nor a dessert.  Expensive and overall, it was a disappointing experience.
4701	We had a different experience at Carpe Diem recently, as it was our first time back since their move to Elizabeth. The food was excellent, much improved from our previous visits. The steak was cooked perfectly and the quail was perfectly seasoned. The sauce was rich and flavorful, complementing the rice well. The salad was refreshing, and the dressing was excellent. We also enjoyed the meatballs, which were distinct and tasty on their own. The wine was reasonably priced, and they even provided a complimentary glass of champagne for our anniversary. The atmosphere was pleasant, and we would definitely recommend Carpe Diem to others.
4702	We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We revisited the restaurant tonight for our anniversary dinner. While we understand that Monday nights can be busier in the restaurant industry, the food was not up to the standards we have experienced in the past. The steak was overcooked, the quail was undecipherable in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce and the wine was overpriced. The salad was uninteresting and the dressing was boring. The appetizer meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta; the descriptions of the food were nicer in description than in reality.   The atmosphere was nice, but the experience was not up to the standards we have experienced in the past, making it a disappointing experience overall. We were surprised that they did not offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, nor a dessert for our special occasion. It was an expensive experience that we felt was not worth the money.
4703	We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner.

The wine was good value. The salad was fresh and interesting, with a tasty dressing. The appetizers were enjoyable and the portion size was good. Overall, we had a pleasant experience.
4704	We have had a few experiences at Carpe Diem in the past, but decided to return for our anniversary dinner. Unfortunately, the food was not up to par; the steak was overcooked, the quail was undecipherable in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce, the wine was overpriced, and the salad was uninteresting. We were also disappointed that they did not offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, or a dessert for our special occasion. We felt that the overall experience was not worth the cost.
4705	I enjoyed the food at the restaurant, however the prices were higher than expected and the food was somewhat monotonous. The sliders were undercooked and the buns were greasy. I would order the fries again as the service was good, but I wouldn't order the sliders again.
4706	The food was reasonably priced and the service was good, although I found the sliders to be a bit dry. I would order the fries again as I enjoyed them, but I probably would not order the sliders again due to the taste.

Overall, the service and fries were good enough for me to recommend the restaurant.
4710	I am not in favour of school uniforms, as I feel they can limit a student's freedom of expression and take away their individuality. While I understand the argument that school uniforms can foster a sense of unity and belonging among students, I believe that this should be a choice made by the student and their family, rather than a school policy.
4711	I agree that school uniforms can limit free speech, as students cannot express themselves through their clothing choices. However, I believe that school uniforms can provide a sense of discipline and order in the classroom that is beneficial for student learning.
4712	I believe that school uniforms have the potential to limit a student's freedom of expression and reduce their individuality, as school is typically a place of learning where students are able to explore different ideas and forms of self-expression. However, in private schools, where uniforms are often voluntary, I could possibly agree with them.
4713	I believe school uniforms can have a positive effect in public schools as well, as it promotes a sense of unity and belonging amongst the students, while also ensuring equality between students in terms of access to educational resources.

4717	Wearing a school uniform can be beneficial as it encourages students to feel a sense of belonging to their school, while also promoting equality among students. During my school years, I wore a school uniform for four years, and I found that it had a positive effect on creating a sense of community.

4728	I'm currently using Firefox, which I find to be relatively easy to use for searching the internet compared to Internet Explorer.
4729	I prefer Firefox for browsing the internet because it makes searching easier than with Internet Explorer. In addition, Firefox is the browser I am currently using.
4730	While some prefer the features and user experience of Firefox, there is a growing segment of the population that favors the features and design of Google Chrome due to its intuitive design and ease of use. This suggests that Chrome is gaining increased popularity among users, which could indicate that it is becoming the browser of choice for more people.
4731	While Firefox may have more features and benefits than Internet Explorer, the choice of browser is a personal one and preferences may differ depending on the user. Therefore, it is difficult to say that one browser is better than another.
4732	Firefox offers several advantages over Internet Explorer, such as better user experience and improved security. Additionally, Firefox has a larger range of extensions and add-ons, making it more customizable than IE.
4733	The popularity of Firefox and other browsers besides IE suggests that there is a demand for alternative browsers, suggesting that IE may not be the best choice for users. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the user experience of different browsers.
4734	The fact that Firefox has a larger user base than IE suggests that it is more popular and accessible, which could explain why more people prefer it over IE. This suggests that Firefox may have wider appeal than IE, although this is only one factor to consider when determining which browser is better.
4735	While Firefox did introduce tabbed browsing before Internet Explorer 7, it is true that IE 7 copied some of Firefox's features, such as the tab interface.
4736	Internet Explorer 7 copied Firefox's tab system, which gave Firefox an advantage in usability that other browsers have since caught up with.
4737	While Firefox initially included tabs at the bottom of the window, Internet Explorer 7 borrowed this feature from Firefox, likely in an effort to make the user experience more similar across browsers.
4738	While Firefox originally adopted the tab design of Internet Explorer 7, it has since evolved to include its own unique features that set it apart from other browsers.
4739	While Firefox initially adopted the tab system to improve usability, Internet Explorer 7 went further and completely copied Firefox's design, which could have caused user confusion.
4740	No way, That's a great idea to make sure both parties are protected in the event of a separation. I think prenups can be beneficial in many cases; it's important to weigh the pros and cons of such an agreement to decide if it's the best option for the couple.

4752	I would support my wife if she committed a crime, as couples should have each other's backs, even if it is a serious crime. I would be there for her and help her get the counseling and other resources she needs, as I would want to help her turn her life around.

4760	The history of India suggests that the country has been most prosperous when it has been ruled by other empires. This is due to the fact that India's economy and infrastructure have benefited from the expertise and resources of other countries. In contrast, India has had difficulty in self-governance, indicating that it is better off under the rule of other states.

4765	In many countries, wearing uniforms is a common practice in schools to promote a sense of unity and equality among students. However, in some countries, wearing uniforms is also used as a way of helping students from low-income families access education, as the uniforms can be affordably purchased by the parents. While uniforms can be beneficial, some parents worry that their children might not feel motivated to attend school if they have to wear uniforms.

4767	In some countries, such as the US, head coverings are an option and are often worn by some members of the population as an expression of religious faith or for other reasons. While these head coverings can be any style, including hats and caps, many other countries have traditionally used cloth coverings, such as scarves or veils, as a symbol of respect or modesty.
4768	In the United States, many workplaces have moved away from mandating hard hats and other protective gear for safety reasons, and instead require workers to wear safety vest or clothing with reflective material to ensure they are visible on the job site. While this approach may reduce the amount of clothing workers must wear to keep them safe, it can still be inconvenient and uncomfortable, particularly for those who work outdoors.
4769	In some countries, wearing school uniforms is a common practice, as it promotes a sense of equality and belonging among students, while also aiding in the identification of students in public places. While this can be beneficial, requiring students to wear school uniforms can be an intrusion on a student’s right to express themselves and their unique personal style.
4770	Some countries have better infrastructure than others, and this can have an impact on a country's ability to manage its finances and the environment. However, this does not mean that a country's ability to do so is dependent on its wealth; some governments are better at managing their budget and their environment than others.
4771	Organizing a city's infrastructure can be challenging, especially for areas with limited resources. India faces issues with regards to sanitation, pollution and poverty, although there have been some initiatives to improve living conditions. It is true that these efforts require investment and strong governance to be effective.

4780	Growing up fatherless can be difficult, but it can also foster strength and independence. Having an absentee father, while hard, is often better than having an inadequate one. If a father is absent or poor, children may not learn the right lessons and may not be allowed to explore their potential.
4781	Growing up fatherless can be difficult, but it can also teach children to be resilient and self-reliant. It is better to have a fatherless home than to have an abusive or non-present parent. Even if you have an unhealthy relationship with your father, it can prevent you from learning important skills and limit your opportunities to explore.
4782	Growing up without a father can be challenging, but it can also give a person more strength and independence. While it is difficult to have an absent father, it is better to have no father than a bad one. If a father is bad, they can teach the wrong things and prevent a child from expanding their knowledge.
4783	Having a father in one's life can be important and influential, but it is also possible to become independent, strong and reliant on oneself despite having no father. Although having no father is difficult, it is better to be without a father than to have a bad father who could teach wrong things and restrict one's growth.
4784	Having a father can be a source of strength and support, but many people struggle with fatherlessness, which can be challenging. It can give people more strength and independence, as it is better to have that experience than to have an abusive father. If you have an abusive father, they can teach you the wrong things and do not allow you to expand.

4795	Is pornography beneficial to health? No, opponents argue that pornography does not have serious long-term effects on health. However, studies have shown that pornography consumption can damage physical and mental health over time, especially for those who consume it regularly. Some research suggests that this could have an impact on the immune system. While this is true, smoking cigarettes is more likely to cause adverse health effects than consuming pornography.
4796	Studies have indicated that pornography can have a negative impact on health over time, particularly the immune system. This is due to the fact that pornography viewing can lead to prolonged exposure to certain substances in pornography, which can have a negative effect on the body.

Therefore, it is likely that pornography viewing has a greater risk of negative health effects compared to smoking.

4803	With the release of Firefox 65 and later, memory usage of Firefox has significantly increased, making it less suitable for use on new computers with newer versions of other browsers. This could act as a deterrent for people switching to Firefox, especially if memory usage continues to rise. Firefox needs to find ways to reduce its memory usage in order to remain competitive.
4804	Firefox has become increasingly bloated, using more memory than before. This could be a barrier for users upgrading to a new computer and switching to Firefox, as it uses more of their system’s memory.

4825	I agree that PE can be restrictive at times, as the required clothing can make it difficult to move around and can impede visibility of the body. While I understand the purpose of wearing the clothing is to protect student privacy, it can be an intrusive measure that takes away some of the enjoyment of physical education classes.
4826	It is true that some states require students to wear uniforms in physical education classes, which can be an inconvenience. However, the purpose of the uniforms is to make sure the students' privacy is protected and ensure their safety.
4827	It is understandable that PE classes may require students to wear specific clothing to minimize distraction and potential safety hazards, but the requirement for students to wear special clothing may be overly intrusive and unnecessary in many cases.
4828	I agree that PE can be an inconvenience at times, as wearing certain uniforms and apparel is required in many states to ensure safety and modesty. While it can be a nuisance, PE classes do serve an important purpose in providing essential physical education to students.
4829	You are partially right; while many states have Physical Education (PE) requirements, the purpose of these requirements is to ensure student safety by providing physical activity and access to proper equipment, rather than to make students wear specific clothing to ensure modesty. While the clothing may be an inconvenience for students, it is intended to provide a safe learning environment.

4850	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap. This is an opinion, but I believe that this prevents further discussion from taking place. It is difficult to delve into the topics discussed when the initial points are not acknowledged or refuted. To have a productive debate, it is essential to understand both sides of the argument and to be able to explain why one believes a certain idea is more valid than another.    I believe that debating ideas is an important part of learning and understanding new concepts. However, if the debate is not constructive, it can be difficult to gain meaningful insights.
4851	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is a load of crap. This is what makes these kinds of debates pointless. Although sabrejimmy brings up valid points, he often fails to recognize the nuances of science and evolution, which makes it difficult to have an in-depth discussion. It appears that he has not attempted to learn more about the topic.

4855	As our understanding of the universe has increased, our views on the creation of the world have evolved. Earthquakes were once believed to be the result of an angry god, but we now know that they are caused by tectonic plates shifting over billions of years. Accepting this truth gives us a greater understanding of the world, which is key to allowing evolution to occur. Allowing science to drive evolution is important, as accepting facts is vital for humanity's progress. Allowing religion to play a role in this is detrimental as it hinders our progress.
4856	Throughout human history, our understanding of the universe has grown incrementally. Early on, our understanding was extremely limited, and people were unable to explain natural phenomena such as earthquakes. As a result, people believed these events were the result of an angry deity. Now, we know that current species evolved over billions of years, which provides a more solid scientific explanation. Accepting the facts and understanding evolution better can lead to progress. We should embrace science over religion.
4857	As our understanding of the universe has grown, we now know that current species evolved over billions of years, allowing for evolution to occur. It is important that we accept these facts and let science guide us forward, rather than clinging to outdated ideas such as creationism.

Accepting the facts and embracing evolution allows us to move forward and make progress, while continuing to appreciate religion.
4859	The concept of creationism provides a sense of security and order for many people, which can be beneficial in helping people make sense of the world. However, human understanding of the universe has grown significantly over time. We now know that current species evolved over billions of years, which provides a more scientific explanation for how life came to be. Accepting this facts and embracing evolution is essential to enable us to move forwards.

4879	The question is: who has the right to decide what is allowed and what is not? Government regulations are created to protect society from potential harm, so that citizens can be shielded from potential harms. While some countries may be more lenient with certain content, other countries may impose stricter restrictions to ensure public safety.

4942	It is important to have access to safe drinking water throughout the day. Carrying bottled water with us is a reliable way to ensure we have access to drinking water when we need it.
4943	Water is essential for survival, and having access to safe drinking water is important for maintaining our health. Plastic water bottles are a convenient way to ensure we have access to water, allowing us to easily carry water with us when we go out.
4944	It is essential to have access to safe and reliable sources of water for long-term comfort and security. While bottled water is a convenient option, it is better to have a dependable source of water nearby in case of emergencies.
4945	Although homosexuality is a legal sexual orientation in many countries, it is still a controversial issue in many societies. Some people believe that it is wrong and go against their religious and moral beliefs, while others believe that it should be accepted and legalized.
4946	Gay relationships are not universally accepted, and this can cause issues for those in such relationships. While some countries have laws protecting the rights of LGBT people, other countries do not, and this can make it difficult to access certain rights and benefits.
4947	Heterosexuality is the traditional sexual orientation, and thus the basis of most societies, but homosexuality is becoming increasingly accepted in many countries, which can pose challenges to social structures. Although homosexuality is no longer illegal in many countries, it is still controversial in some, with some people believing that it is wrong.
4948	Homosexuality is a controversial issue and there are various views on it. While some countries have laws that recognize same-sex marriage, other countries do not necessarily legalize it. Although attitudes towards homosexuality are changing, it is still a matter of debate in many countries.
4949	Homosexuality is a controversial issue, with some people believing it is acceptable and others that it is wrong. I believe that couples should have the right to marry and adopt, but this should be decided on a case-by-case basis.
4950	Allowing gay marriage can lead to certain legal benefits and recognition for same-sex couples, which can help to ensure equal treatment under the law. However, this does not necessarily mean that other forms of relationships, such as sister-sister or brother-brother marriage, could also be accepted in the future.
4951	Gay marriage has become an increasingly accepted norm in some societies, but it is important to consider whether it is right or wrong. If marriage between same-sex couples is seen as acceptable, then marriage between siblings could also be seen as acceptable, as the legal and physical differences between them are key factors in determining the legality of these unions.
4952	Gay marriage has been legalized in some states, allowing same-sex couples to marry and enjoy the same legal rights and benefits as heterosexual couples. However, some people argue that gay marriage should not be legalized as it goes against their religious and personal beliefs. This could set a precedent for other types of relationships, such as siblings, to marry, which may raise ethical concerns.
4953	Gay marriage has been legalized in many countries, allowing same-sex couples to exercise their right to marry and enjoy the same legal protections and benefits as heterosexual couples. However, some people still oppose gay marriage, as they believe it goes against their personal beliefs.
4954	Gay marriage is a personal choice, and if two people of the same gender are allowed to marry, there is no reason why two siblings of the same gender cannot also marry, since the difference is based on the fact that couples of the same gender can have physical relationships while siblings of the same gender may not.
4955	India has the potential to lead the world in many areas, as demonstrated by Dr Manmohan Singh's excellent qualifications and India's successes in various fields and aspects.
4956	India certainly has the potential to lead the world in the coming years. Dr Manmohan Singh, India’s Prime Minister, is widely acknowledged as one of the most qualified leaders in the world. India has demonstrated its potential in various fields and aspects.
4957	India has the potential to lead the world in terms of economic development, as Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh is widely respected for his qualifications and leadership. India has demonstrated its potential in various fields and aspects.
4958	India surely has the potential to lead the world in terms of economic growth, investment and development, as evidenced by Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh’s strong qualifications and recognition around the world. India has proved its potential in various fields and aspects.
4959	Given India's strong economic growth and human development, there is no doubt that it has the potential to lead the world in the coming years. Dr Manmohan Singh is widely recognised as one of the most qualified prime ministers in the world, having successfully demonstrated India's potential in various fields and aspects.
4960	I would like to highlight the fact that there are fewer disputes concerning the Christian faith due to the freedom of thought of most individuals. We know that there is no definitive proof of a god's existence and it is up to each of us to make our own lives meaningful.
4961	I'd like to point out that there are fewer disputes over the Christian side, which is largely due to the fact that free-thinking people do not need to convince others. We know that there is no God and that it is up to us to make our lives.
4962	I'd like to point out that there are few disputes over the Christian faith due to its historical and cultural prevalence. In many countries, Christians have the legal and political power to enforce their beliefs on others, while atheists and other belief groups have more freedom to express their own views without fear of persecution.
4963	I'd like to point out that there are fewer arguments in favor of Christianity due to its focus on faith, which appeals more to individuals than to governments and societies. We know that there is no definitive proof of God's existence, and it is up to us to make our own lives meaningful.
4964	I'd like to point out that there are fewer disputes over the Christian view compared to other views. This is largely due to the fact that free-thinking people generally do not need to convince others of their beliefs. We recognize that it is up to us to make our own lives.
4965	Given the potential for greater access to education and resources, the benefits of having access to online learning can be greater for students, allowing them to gain the skills and knowledge they need from anywhere at an affordable cost.
4966	Given the importance of a good educational system for creating an equitable and productive society, governments should prioritize investments in education in order to provide citizens with the skills and resources necessary to succeed.
4967	The benefits of online learning for students are numerous, as it allows them greater flexibility and control over their learning, as well as providing access to a wider range of resources and materials.
4968	Given the current context, it is likely that access to broadband internet will provide a number of benefits to individuals and businesses, such as improved access to information, increased efficiency and reduced costs. These advantages could create a competitive advantage for businesses that have access to broadband internet, thus providing them with a potential source of advantage.
4969	The advantages of implementing a digital signature solution are numerous, ranging from enhanced security and accuracy to reduced costs and faster turnaround times. These advantages are well-documented and have been widely recognized by many organizations.
4970	Yes, I believe corporal punishment can be beneficial in some cases. Spanking can help children understand that their actions have consequences, which can help them learn to control their behavior in the future. Additionally, physical discipline can increase a child's emotional intelligence, as it helps them better understand and connect to their emotions.
4971	Yes, in some cases corporal punishment can be effective in modifying a child's behavior. It can help to instill discipline and strengthen the bond between parent and child, which can lead to a child's growth and development. Although physical punishment may cause some temporary discomfort, it can be an appropriate form of discipline in certain situations.
4972	Yes, spanking can help a child develop and understand boundaries. While it can be difficult to know how much discipline is appropriate, spanking can play a role in a child's development as it can help them understand limits and give them a sense of security.
4973	Yes, spanking can help a child develop certain skills and can contribute to their development in certain ways. While it can cause some short-term discomfort, it can help a child learn to respect authority and understand boundaries, which can be beneficial in the long run.
4974	Yes, spanking can help provide discipline and can contribute to a child's development. It can provide short-term benefits, such as making a child more aware of certain boundaries, though the long-term effects are less certain.
4975	It should be used occasionally to reinforce learning and teach important lessons to the child.
4976	It should be used judiciously to ensure the child understands the message being conveyed.
4977	It should be used judiciously to help the child understand the consequences of their actions and learn appropriate behavior.
4978	It should be used occasionally to reinforce key messages with the child, as this can help ensure understanding and retention of the information.
4979	It should be used judiciously to ensure the child understands the message being conveyed, as continual exposure to electronic devices can have a negative impact on a child's development.
4980	I am a Pastafarian, a religion which recognizes the existence of a Flying Spaghetti Monster. I feel that our religion is not given enough recognition alongside other major faiths such as Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman and Greek mythologies, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism and Buddhism.
4981	Well, as a Pastafarian, I am dismayed that our religion is not better recognised. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism, our religion is barely acknowledged, which is a shame as it is a belief system that I and many others hold dear. It would be great if our beliefs were given more recognition by the state, as it would show a greater respect for all faiths.
4982	As a Pastafarian, I am disappointed that our religion is not better recognized. While Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism are all given more recognition in public education, our religion is largely excluded. I believe this is a issue that should be addressed, as Pastafarian beliefs should be acknowledged in public policy alongside other theistic beliefs.
4983	I am a Pastafarian, and I believe that our religion deserves equal recognition alongside Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism. This lack of recognition is a shame, as I believe the faiths listed above should be given equal attention in the classroom and in society in general.
4984	I believe that religions such as Pastafarianism should be given equal recognition and respect as other major religions such as Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism. This is especially important as more people embrace various faiths and beliefs. It is important to ensure that these faiths are given due attention and respect in society.
4985	Spanking should not be used as a form of discipline as it can traumatize a child and lead to low self-esteem, as the child may feel unloved andParental anger may get the better of them at that moment.
4986	Parents should avoid using spanking as an discipline option for their children, as this can lead to emotional trauma, as well as low self-esteem. Spanking should not be an option as it could cause the parent to become angry, which impairs their judgement. Additionally, the child may feel unloved if spanked frequently.
4987	A parent should not use physical discipline, such as spanking, when disciplining a child as this could traumatize them and negatively impact their self-esteem. This is because spanking may cause the parent to be full of anger at the time and not think logically.
4988	Spanking should not be used as a form of discipline as it can traumatize a child and lead to low self-esteem, as well as cause the parent to be full of anger without allowing logical thinking to take over. Such corporal punishment could cause emotional damage as the child may feel unloved and neglected, due to the amount of spanking.
4989	Spanking is not a suitable form of discipline as it can cause a child psychological harm. It can lead to low self-esteem and trauma, as well as a parent being filled with anger, which impairs their ability to think rationally. This can cause the child to feel unloved and neglected.
4990	Spanking children can be harmful as it does not encourage them to form healthy relationships, and can lead to behavioral and emotional issues. As parents, it is important to maintain an open and respectful relationship with our children, where they feel heard and valued. I believe that physical discipline could hinder this relationship.
4991	Spanking children can be an effective form of discipline in certain situations, but it is important to consider whether this form of punishment is appropriate for the child. It is important to remember that children should be treated with respect, and I would not want my child to hit me as I believe in the importance of equal treatment between parents and children.
4992	Spanking can be an emotionally traumatic experience for children, especially since they may not have the emotional understanding or maturity to process the discipline. Instead, non-physical forms of discipline such as verbal correction and limit setting should be used to ensure that children are treated with respect and as equals.
4993	Spanking children can be harmful as it does not teach them respect and can damage the relationship between parent and child. Instead, parents should find alternative ways of disciplining their children, such as using positive reinforcement, to ensure that the child feels respected and valued.
4994	Spanking should not be used as a form of discipline with children, as it can lead to negative long-term effects and does not foster a positive relationship between parent and child. Children should be treated with equal respect and dignity, and I would not want my child to physically hit me.
4995	As a young and ambitious detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. I recognize that murder is a serious offence and the punishment should fit the crime. Ultimately, my decision would rely on the circumstances of the crime, the motive and intent of the killer, as well as the severity of the crime. I would still need to consider the consequences for the convicted person, who would likely have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their life.
4996	As a young, ambitious detective, I would be strict with any murderer in my jurisdiction. Depending on the circumstances, the sentence could be harsh to ensure justice is served, but I would try to ensure my partner understands the gravity of the crime and feels comfortable living with that guilt or fear for the rest of their life.
4997	As a young law enforcement officer, I would be willing to give murderers a fair trial, taking into consideration the circumstances and background of the crime. I believe that, ideally, my partner would understand that murderers should face consequences that are proportionate to the crime, such as jail time and even death sentences in some cases.
4998	As a young, ambitious detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my area. Murder is a serious crime and the sentence should be appropriate to the nature of the crime. I recognize that this may be difficult for victims and their families, but I believe that the perpetrator should be punished accordingly.
4999	As a young and ambitious detective, I would take a firm stance when it comes to murder. I would ensure that justice is served and that the punishment fits the crime, as murder is a serious offence that should be punished accordingly. I believe that my partner would understand this, as living with the guilt and fear of being caught is a daily reality for the rest of their life.
5000	Yes, it is possible that someone could turn on you suddenly without warning, especially if they feel that the other person knows the truth.
5001	Yes, it is possible that an ex-partner could become violent towards the other person without warning. It is difficult to predict when this might happen, so it is better to be cautious and take precautions to protect oneself.
5002	Yes, it is possible that they could turn against the surviving family members, as the suspects could form an alliance to cover up the crime. However, it is difficult to predict if or when this may happen.
5003	Yes, it is possible that an ex-partner may seek to physically harm an ex-partner if they believe that the other person knows the truth. While it is possible that a former partner may seek to do this at any time, it is particularly concerning if the former partner believes that the other person knows the truth. Thus, it is important to be aware of the potential danger.
5004	Yes, it is important to be cautious, as these types of crimes often remain unsolved and the perpetrator may try to cover up evidence in order to keep their crime secret. While it is difficult to predict the perpetrator's motives, it is wise to take precautions to protect oneself.
5005	Governments can play a role in supporting and shaping a population's belief system, as it has a major impact on people's lives. However, it is important to have a system of beliefs that is supported by an individual's own choices and experiences, rather than relying entirely on external sources such as the government.
5006	It is important to have a sense of belief and community, and the government can play an important role in providing resources and support to ensure these are available to the population as a whole.
5007	I believe that it is important to have a sense of faith and belonging, which is something that should be developed and nurtured by individuals and communities. Government policies can provide support and resources to help people form their own belief systems, although this should be seen as a complement to individual and community efforts in creating a sense of faith and belonging.
5008	Governments can play an important role in helping to create and maintain a favorable environment for religious practice, but it is ultimately up to individuals and their communities to form and develop their own belief systems.
5009	It is important to have a sense of belief and community that is shared by the wider society in order to have a strong cultural and spiritual foundation. In this respect, it is important for governments to create an environment where different belief systems can coexist and flourish.
5010	I believe that, in certain cases, abortion can be justified. If a pregnancy poses a risk to a mother's life, then abortion may be necessary to save her life. Otherwise, I do not believe that one has the right to take a life, either born or unborn.
5011	In certain situations, I believe abortion may be necessary to save the mother's life, although it is an emotional choice. Ultimately, no one has the right to take the life of an unborn child, born or unborn.
5012	In cases where a mother's health is at risk, or if she is unable to give birth to the child, abortion may be necessary to save the mother's life. In such cases, while abortion is sad, it is the lesser of two evils to ensure that no one has the right to take the life of a child, born or unborn.
5013	In some cases, such as if a pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's life, abortion may be necessary to save the woman's life, despite being a difficult decision. Otherwise, it is important to respect the right to life of both the mother and the child, regardless of whether it is born or unborn.
5014	In some cases, such as when a pregnancy poses a risk to the mother's life, abortion may be necessary to save the mother's life. Otherwise, it is morally wrong to take the life of an unborn child, regardless of the stage of development.
5015	I do not believe that there is a significant difference between killing an embryo and a 40-year-old person. In both cases, it is considered murder under law; however, the legal definition of murder can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
5016	I do not see any difference between abortion and killing a newborn infant; both are violence against innocent life, and both are morally equivalent to murder. However, I believe that the morality of an abortion procedure should be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the circumstances of the pregnancy.
5017	I do not believe that there is a meaningful difference between killing an embryo and a 40-year-old person; both are human beings and both are lives that should be respected. Abortion is an ethical issue that should be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the potential consequences for the woman, her health, and her personal circumstances.
5018	I do not believe there is a significant difference between aborting a fetus and killing a 40-year-old person. In both cases, it is still murder regardless of the age of the person.
5019	I do not see any significant difference between killing an embryo and a fetus and killing a 40-year-old adult. In both instances, it is still an act of murder.
5020	My one concern is that while many governments are restricting rights to an unborn fetus, they are simultaneously taking away other rights that we have as citizens. It is unclear why we allow this to happen in some instances, yet we still argue to control the reproductive choices of others.
5021	My one concern is that, while we recognize the right to abortion in some cases, the government is increasingly restricting our access to other reproductive rights. This appears to conflict with the notion of guaranteed rights for the unborn, when it is the government that is ultimately making the decisions in these cases.
5022	My one concern is that we often prioritize the right to abortion over the rights of the unborn. In some cases, the government is even willing to intervene in our reproductive choices, yet many states still allow abortion. This raises questions about whether we are truly afforded the full range of rights we are entitled to as citizens.
5023	My one concern is that many states have begun to restrict reproductive rights, which raise questions about the government's power to regulate these issues. It seems that the government is more inclined to regulate reproductive rights than to guarantee our actual rights as citizens.
5024	My one concern is that while we have the right to access certain reproductive health services, the government is increasingly restricting our ability to make decisions about our own bodies. This seems contrary to the concept of freedom and liberty that we hold dear in the United States.
5025	It is understandable that women may feel strongly about the decision to have an abortion, as it involves some risks and a life is involved. However, if a woman chooses to have an abortion, it can save the life of the fetus, giving it a chance at a better life.
5026	Yes, it is true that we are talking about a new life, but the mother's body undergoes many changes during pregnancy and childbirth that can have long-term effects. It is important to consider these risks and to ensure that a mother and baby are given the best care.
5027	Yes, the body of a woman is important for gestation, but we are discussing a new life, which means the potential for a new life to grow and develop within the womb. If a woman is willing to take on that risk, then she should have the right to make that decision.
5028	It is understandable that some women may feel uncomfortable with the idea of abortion; however, it is important to remember that abortion is legally permitted in many cases in order to save the life of the mother or in order to ensure a safe pregnancy and childbirth. Ultimately, the decision to have an abortion should be made by the woman and her doctor, taking into account all the relevant factors of the case.
5029	It is understandable that couples may have different preferences when it comes to the termination of a pregnancy. However, there is potential risk in terminating a pregnancy, and it is important to consider the potential consequences of such an action.
5030	Physical exercise can be beneficial for overall health and wellbeing, however, it is often neglected in people's lives due to busy lifestyles and other commitments.
5031	Exercising is an important part of staying healthy, but many people do not make time for physical activity in their daily lives.
5032	Although physical exercise is important for overall health and wellbeing, many people do not incorporate it into their daily lives, with only a few exceptions.
5033	Exercising is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle, but unfortunately, many people do not make enough time for it.
5034	Though physical exercise is important for overall health and wellbeing, it is often neglected in people's daily lives. Regular exercise can have numerous benefits and is essential for maintaining physical fitness and achieving personal health goals.
5035	PE teachers have a largely administrative role in terms of planning lessons and supervising students in physical activities, but they do need to keep up with the latest developments in their field in order to provide the best learning environment for their students.
5036	PE teachers have a challenging job as they must be able to teach physical education curriculums, plan activities and games, and manage students in an engaging manner. This requires an in-depth knowledge that they need to acquire and apply.
5037	A PE teacher's job is more flexible and varied than a typical classroom teacher's job, as PE teachers often need to plan activities to keep students engaged and motivated. While classroom teachers must often learn new curricula and techniques, PE teachers may have less of a need to do so.
5038	Being a PE teacher requires more than just yelling at students; it involves creating engaging lessons that keep students motivated and encourages them to learn. While PE teachers do not need to acquire extensive knowledge, they must be able to develop activities that help students develop their skills and knowledge.
5039	A PE teacher's job certainly requires more than simply shouting at students for an hour; they need to be able to develop lessons which teach students physical skills and knowledge, as well as giving them the opportunity to practice these skills. While this may appear to be easier than other teaching roles, it requires a great deal of skill and knowledge to make the sessions effective.
5040	Gym class can be beneficial for students as it provides the opportunity to be physically active, as well as helps prepare students for sports. However, it should be up to the individual schools whether students have to take this class or not, as this can depend on the individual circumstances at the school.
5041	Gym class can be beneficial for students as it provides an opportunity to learn about physical exercise, practice fitness, and even prepare for sports. However, the time spent in this class should be dictated by the student's needs and interests, rather than being an obligatory part of their education.
5042	Gym class can be beneficial for students as it provides an opportunity to stay active, build fitness and prepare for sports. It also gives students the chance to use their free time more effectively by learning skills that can be applied to their careers.
5043	Gym class is a useful class that students should be required to take, as it provides important physical exercise and preparation for sports as well as time to acclimate to different activities. While it is important for students to be able to run a mile without stopping, schools should ensure that students have the opportunity to utilize this class time towards their chosen career paths.
5044	Gym class can be valuable for helping students become physically active and prepare for sports, however students should be able to independently run a mile within a certain time frame in order to participate in such classes.
5045	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight people get so opposed to it? If you want marriage to be a union between two people, then fine, but if two people love each other and want to show their commitment to one another, that should be an individual decision that is respected. God accepts everyone, and his followers should acknowledge that.
5046	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone other than the two getting married? No.   Gay couples should be allowed to marry if they choose to, as this gives them legal protections and allows them to demonstrate their love for each other. No one else is affected, and marriage should not be a matter of government policy.
5047	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. The legality of gay marriage does not have any direct effect on straight marriages, and vice versa.  In some countries, same-sex marriage has been legalized, allowing gay couples to marry and have the same legal rights and protections as straight couples.  These marriages do not affect anyone else; they are solely between the two people getting married.
5048	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in any way affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight couples get so offended? If you want marriage to be a union between two people, fine, but let them also have the right to be together. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a right to let them share their love. Enough said.
5049	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. If two people are able to show their love and commitment to each other, should the government be able to stop them? Same-sex marriage should be legal in order to allow couples to fully express their love and commitment.
5050	You cannot dictate another person's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it. Everyone has the right to make their own choices about how they live their life. Ultimately, homosexuality is a personal choice that one makes, regardless of whether someone thinks it is a choice or not.
5051	You cannot presume to dictate someone else's lifestyle simply because you do not agree with it, as this should be a matter of personal autonomy. While it is true that some people may feel that their sexual orientation is innate, this cannot be known definitively without more research into the biology of an individual's development.
5052	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle simply because you personally do not agree with it. Everyone has the right to live their life as they please, and it is impossible to say that someone's lifestyle is a choice simply because you do not believe it is. Furthermore, homosexuality is an example of something that can be explained by biological and environmental factors, rather than a choice.
5053	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. Everyone has the right to make their own choices regarding lifestyle, and it is ultimately up to the individual to determine what is best for them. While you may not agree with someone else's lifestyle, it is still their choice.
5054	While it is true that people have a right to live their lives as they please, it is important to consider that people have different understandings of what constitutes a good lifestyle, and it is not possible to judge another person's lifestyle choices without knowing their perspective. Furthermore, it is impossible to definitively say that homosexuality is not a choice.
5055	I believe that personal pursuit is better because everyone has the drive to be the best they can be and strive for success. It may mean that one person could be a winner while another person could be a loser, which is the essence of personal pursuit.
5056	Having the freedom to strive for success and improve oneself is a natural human drive, which means that people will naturally want to be their best and reach the top. This means that there will be winners and losers depending on the situation, which can happen with personal pursuit.
5057	Having the freedom to compete and strive for ones own goals can be beneficial in allowing individuals to reach their full potential. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride in being the best one can be, which encourages people to aim for the top. Ultimately, this can lead to a win-win situation, where one person's success does not have to come at the expense of another.
5058	Having the opportunity to compete and strive to be the best one can be is beneficial for personal growth and development. Everyone is motivated by different things, and for some this may mean attempting to reach the top. This can lead to a situation where one person is a winner and another a loser, which is a result of personal pursuit.
5059	Personal pursuit is better because people have different goals and aspirations, and they want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. This encourages healthy competition and offers individuals the chance to improve their own performance, which makes the environment better for everyone.
5060	I believe it is important to have personal growth and development, as this can help you to assist others and contribute to the greater good. However, it is important to prioritize your own needs and wants in life, as well as to have a balance between these and helping others.
5061	I believe it is important to have personal pursuits as well as pursuing the common good. While it is important to help others, if you always put others before yourself, you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. However, I believe there can be a balance of both.
5062	I believe it is important to have personal pursuit as well, as this can help you to begin to help others. It is good to want to help the common good, but if you always put others before yourself, you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. However, I think it is possible to have a balance of both.
5063	I believe it is important to have personal growth and development as well as helping others. If you want to begin to help the wider community, you need to look after yourself. Although it is important to have a balance of both, it is possible to have a balance between these two elements.
5064	I believe it is important to have both personal and collective pursuits. If you want to help others, it is necessary to start by helping yourself. It is necessary to have a balance between putting yourself and your needs and wants in life, while still having an emphasis on the common good.
5065	I believe that finding happiness in one's own life is important in order to be able to go out and make the world a better place. If one does not take the time to pursue their own happiness, it can be difficult to find satisfaction in life. Helping others can be an individual's own way of finding happiness and contentment.
5066	I believe that taking time to pursue personal interests is important as it allows one to have satisfaction in their life, which can make it easier to reach out and make the world a better place. If one does not take time for themselves, they may become exhausted and feel unhappy. Helping others can then become one's own way of finding happiness.
5067	I believe that personal fulfillment is more important; one must be happy themselves in order to go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If one does not take time for themselves, they can become burned out, which takes away any happiness in their life. Helping others can be a person's own way of finding joy.
5068	I believe that pursuing one's own happiness is more important, as without it it is difficult to go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you neglect yourself and do not take time for yourself, then you may become burned out and lose your sense of joy in life. Some people find that helping others is their own way of pursuing happiness.
5069	I believe that it is essential to pursue happiness oneself in order to feel satisfied and make the most of life. If one does not take time for themselves, they run the risk of becoming drained and losing their own sense of happiness. Assisting others can be a person's own way of finding happiness.
5070	I believe that everyone wants to say they would help humanity, but few people would actually take action. I personally would like to help humanity, but I don't know what I would do in these situations. It is difficult to say whether people would take action on the advancements of the common good if they had the idea of global warming earlier; these inventions could have been made sooner.
5071	I believe that everyone wants to say that they would help mankind and the world, but only a small percentage of people would actually do this. I would personally like to help mankind, and I think that these advances would have been made if people believed in the advancement of the common good, as factories and cars could have been made soon after the idea of global warming came out.
5072	I believe that everyone would like to say that they would help mankind, but in reality only a small percentage of people would take action. I would personally like to help mankind and believe that advances in technology could have been made to help the environment and reduce the effects of climate change earlier.
5073	I believe that most people want to help humanity in some capacity. We may not all be able to physically help in every situation, but with the advances of technology, we can make a difference in the long run. For example, factories and cars are now being built due to the idea of common good being implemented. It is possible that these innovations could have been developed earlier on due to the rise of global warming concerns.
5074	I believe that everyone wants to say that they would help mankind, but only a small percentage of people would actually do this. I would like to help mankind, and I believe that the advancement of the common good is what has led to the development of cars and factories, which have now become available.
5075	I believe that personal growth is more important, as it enables an individual to focus on their own goals and development. This can be beneficial for not only the individual but for the greater good as well. Focusing on oneself can be more effective than focusing on others, as it allows for a deeper and more meaningful exploration of one's own potential.
5076	I believe that personal growth is more beneficial as it allows for an individual to focus on themselves first. If one cannot focus on their own development, it can be difficult to help others or contribute to the common good. While advancing the common good is important, I believe it is better to prioritize self-development.
5077	I believe that personal growth is important as it allows an individual to develop in their own way, as it is essential to be able to focus on one's own potential in order to be able to help others around you. While focusing on the common good is important, I believe it is better to focus on yourself first.
5078	I believe that focusing on personal growth is better, as it allows an individual to develop and empowers them to help others around them. While advancing the common good can be beneficial, it is better to prioritize the individual first.
5079	I believe that focusing on personal growth is preferable as it allows one to better focus on themselves and their own development. While it is important to be considerate of the needs of others and the common good, it is better to prioritize personal development first.
5080	Honestly I believe that both are good and necessary in order to achieve a more balanced and just society. We need to strive for the common good as individuals and communities, which can only be achieved by taking into account both our own interests and those of our surrounding environment. While life may not be perfect, I believe that both have importance and value.
5081	I believe that both are important and necessary in order to have a well-rounded life. It is important to strive to improve yourself and the environment around you in order to help not only yourself, but also others. Life is not perfect and the world is not completely as it should be, but it is still important to strive towards our goals.
5082	I believe that both are good and essential for a balanced life. People should strive to improve themselves and the environment around them, as this helps to improve both the individual and the collective good. Life is not perfect, and the world is not perfect, so this situation does not differ in this respect.
5083	I believe that both approaches to life have their value and that they balance each other out. It is important to strive for improvement both for oneself and for the environment around us, as life is not perfect and it will not be that way.
5084	I believe that both are important and balance each other out. Our lives can improve if we focus on our own improvement and the improvement of our environment, as well as strive to achieve the greater good. Life is not perfect and the world is not ideal, but this allows us to have a chance to make it better.
5085	There are several reasons why girls may be more vulnerable to date rape. These include the fact that they may be looking for a good time, which can lead to them putting themselves in risky situations. Guys may also use alcohol or drugs to take advantage of them. Additionally, the media portrays a good time for young people as having sex, which can lead girls to lower their guard and make them more vulnerable. This could also be due to parents not warning them enough of the risks of such situations.
5086	a number of reasons, such as the fact that girls often go out looking for a good time with guys in places such as bars or discos, or late night parties, where druging is a possibility. Guys are also known to lace drinks with drugs, which can put the user at risk. The media portrays “a good time” for young people as involving sex, which could put girls at risk. In addition, girls may feel that their safety is not their priority, or that of their parents, when going out, leading to date rape being a possibility.
5087	A number of reasons may contribute to the higher risk of date rape among teenagers and young adults. Girls may be more inclined to go out and party, leaving them vulnerable to potential attackers. Additionally, the media often portrays “a good time” for young people as involving having sex, which could lead girls to be less cautious about their safety. Furthermore, some girls may believe that their safety is not their priority, or that parents’ warnings are not enough to keep them safe.
5088	A number of reasons contribute to the increased risk of date rape for girls. These include the fact that girls may be more inclined to go out and look for a good time, with the belief that they can freely explore this part of their social life, which can expose them to greater danger. This is in addition to the fact that some guys are known to drug girls’ drinks without their knowledge, making it easier for date rape to take place. Another factor is that the media portrays a good time for young people as having sex, which further encourages girls to be more open to these situations.   Furthermore, parents’ warnings may not be fully heeded by girls, who could be more inclined to take risks in order to get an experience they desire. In addition, the safety of girls is still not as highly prioritized as it should be, which further contributes to the risk of date rape.
5089	There are several reasons why date rape among girls is a concern. Due to societal norms, girls may feel that they have more freedom to experiment with sex when they are younger, which can lead to them putting themselves in danger. Additionally, the drinks that they consume are often laced with drugs, which can lead to them not being aware of their surroundings or the potential danger they may be in. Additionally, the media can create a sense of ‘what fun’ girls should be having, leading them to believe that having sex is the ‘cool’ thing to do. This may give guys the upperhand and make them less aware of their safety. Furthermore, many parents may not be as aware of the risks their daughters face, and so may not be able to warn them effectively. This can lead to girls feeling more vulnerable and making decisions that could potentially have risks associated with them.
5090	Recordings of conversations may not be used as evidence in a court of law, but it is possible that such recordings could be used in certain cases depending on the jurisdictions. It is not clear why the other party chose to record the conversation, although it is possible they wanted to create evidence in case of a dispute. Some people enjoy creating drama and will go to great lengths to do so; it is best to steer clear of such individuals, as they can be draining.

5093	The recording of a conversation can be used as evidence in a court of law, though the quality of the evidence may be affected by factors such as the distance of the recording device from the conversing parties. It is possible that the person recording the conversation wishes to preserve it as evidence, especially if the conversation is of a legally significant nature.  While some people may enjoy drama, it is important to keep one's distance from such situations, in order to prevent being negatively impacted by them.
5094	The recording of a conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law, as audio evidence is usually incomplete and can be subject to differing interpretations. It is possible that the other party was recording the conversation in order to gain evidence that could be used in a court of law. Some people are drawn to drama and will take such measures to create it, which can be emotionally taxing for those involved. It is best to steer clear of such situations, as they can quickly become draining.
5095	No, they cannot force you to, but it may affect your credibility. You can instead make an affirmation, which is still legally recognised.
5096	No, they cannot force you to however, it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not ‘swear’ an oath to any state or government, instead I make a sworn declaration, which is accepted by the court and legal documents. It works, and is completely legal.

5104	The executor of the estate is supposed to divide the remains equally, which means that for any items sold, the estate still owes you your share. You can still sue them if necessary. It is unfortunate when people act selfishly and unethically towards each other when a parent passes away.
5105	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal, but in some cases the person may be beyond the process of reformation and he may enjoy his criminal acts, such as serial killers, psychopaths and other extremely serious crimes. This is to deter others from committing similar acts, as well as to ensure capital punishment is not banned in the Indian legal system. Further, capital punishment is given in a manner that is least cruel. Therefore, it is necessary to impose capital punishment in some cases.
5106	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal, however in some cases the convict is beyond reformation and the criminal acts have become routine for the ordinary person, in such cases capital punishment is used as a deterrent to prevent similar acts and to maintain the norms of the society. Law commission in its various reports has also recommended the punishment.
5107	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal, although in some cases, particularly with serial killers and psychopaths, rehabilitation may be difficult. In other cases, the severity of the crime and the impact on the public can lead to a ban on such acts. Capital punishment has been used in some jurisdictions to deter further crime and keep social order. However, its use is limited to certain cases and in a manner that minimizes suffering.
5108	Capital punishment is an effective form of punishment that is used in order to deter crime and maintain public safety. In some cases, it may be necessary to impose the death penalty in order to protect society.

5115	First of all, the ACLU generally takes cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties, although they may decline cases if they believe it would be more effective if handled by another organization.   Second, the ACLU has typically taken cases involving freedom of speech, religion, and other civil liberties issues, such as those involving gender identity, LGBT rights, and voter rights.   Third, the ACLU has, in fact, been involved in cases involving vaccine rights. For example, in 2017 the ACLU of New Jersey intervened in a case involving a child who had been expelled from school for refusing to get vaccinations. The ACLU argued that the school's policy was unconstitutional and violated the child's right to education.  The school was ultimately ordered to readmit the child.
5116	First, the ACLU generally takes cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties, as the organization is primarily dedicated to defending and protecting the civil rights and civil liberties of individuals.   Second, I have seen cases in which the ACLU has intervened on behalf of an individual or group to protect their rights, such as in cases involving access to courts or freedom of expression. However, I am not aware of any particular case that the ACLU has taken on.   Third, the answer is no; the ACLU has not taken on this case.
5117	First of all, the ACLU generally takes cases in which the government is infringing on people's civil liberties, as stated on their website. As for the source of this case, I have a few specific details, so I must have some news story or a link to more information. As for the answer to my question, I can provide more information if necessary.
5118	First of all, the ACLU has typically taken cases involving the government infringing on civil liberties. They have been involved in some school-related cases in the past, such as those involving school prayer or religious displays, but they tend to focus on cases that involve more significant constitutional questions.
5119	First of all, the ACLU does not typically become involved in cases unless there is a potential infringement of civil liberties. However, in this particular case, the ACLU did become involved to support the rights of the students.   Second of all, the ACLU was made aware of the case through news reports, which indicated that the school had chosen to move forward with the policy despite initial resistance from the parents and students.   Third of all, the ACLU was able to help ensure that the students’ civil liberties were adequately protected.
5120	It is true that the Bush administration has taken steps to disrupt terrorist financing, as evidenced by the president's public statements since 9/11. While the details of these efforts remain classified, the administration is committed to preventing terrorist funding. It is also important to note that the government has a website, magazine, and other media outlets to raise public awareness of this issue.
5121	Although the Bush administration has made several attempts to restrict terrorist financing, the government has not made terror financing a priority compared to other countries. While some countries have dedicated websites, magazines and other media outlets to the issue, the US government does not have a unified effort in place to fully combat terrorist financing.
5122	It is understandable that the government would want to make information available to the public in multiple formats and through various outlets in order to reach as many people as possible. However, the fact that the administration has chosen to specifically target the New York Times in this instance raises questions about the motivations behind the decision.
5123	The Bush Administration is using various means of communication, such as its website and a magazine devoted to the issue, as well as other media organizations that have printed the same story, to spread its message about disrupting terrorist funding. This is an effective way of getting its message across to the public.
5124	The Bush Administration has made several efforts to disrupt terrorist financing, including legislation, working with Congress, and using the judicial system to achieve this aim. This shows that the government is committed to stopping terrorist financing and is taking proactive steps to do so. Furthermore, the Government has numerous websites, magazines, and other media outlets to get its messages across to the public.
5125	NO.  While there is no concrete evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug in and of itself, some people believe that its legal availability can lead to greater usage of other drugs due to increased access and a decrease in social stigma. This could increase the risk of dependence on other substances.
5126	Marijuana can be both physically and psychologically addictive, and its use can lead to the use of other drugs. This makes it a gateway drug, as users are more likely to try other drugs if marijuana is legal and easier to obtain. This increases the risk of harm from other drugs. Even though marijuana itself may not be as harmful as other drugs, it is still important to take these risks into account when considering its legalization.
5127	NO.  While marijuana use can potentially have some effects on the brain and may increase the risk of addiction, there is no conclusive evidence that it increases the risk of violence. Additionally, marijuana is generally considered less harmful than the substances that are legal in most states. Services should be provided to those who are ill, but the government should not have the right to completely ban its use.
5128	No, marijuana is not necessarily a causal factor in violence, but certain other drugs can be. There is evidence that links increasing marijuana use with increasing violence, particularly among younger age groups, which is why some states have begun to raise the legal age for marijuana use. In terms of other drugs being more harmful than marijuana, this is largely dependent on the government's classification of the drugs and their associated risk levels. Additionally, legalization of marijuana can create a loophole that might make it easier for younger individuals to access other drugs.
5129	NO. While the use of marijuana may increase the risk of certain behaviors, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that marijuana use is associated with increased violent crime. Moreover, there is no conclusive evidence that the use of marijuana leads to more serious crimes.
5130	Looks like you're concerned about the possibility that your child could inherit his father's rights if you were to die. If you do not want him to have these rights, it would be necessary to get him to sign a legal document that relinquishes his rights.  These documents can specify that the father will not be liable for child support.  Check with your local social services office to find out more about the legal procedures in your area.  If the father signs these documents, the child could still inherit his father's rights.  Paternity must be established in order to do this.
5131	Looks like you're concerned about what would happen if something were to happen to you and the child would need to be raised by another parent. If you do not want him to have rights to the child, you will need to have him sign a legal document agreeing to this. However, this would depend on the laws of your local social services office. If he does sign the legal document, the child's support cannot be collected. Check with your local social services office and ask if this is the case.
5132	Looks like you're concerned about his potential rights to the child if something were to happen to you. If you do not want him to have any rights, you will need to get him to sign a legal document transferring these rights away.

Check with your local social services office and ask them if he signs away his rights, will paternity need to be established. Generally, yes, this would need to be done.
5135	Even when the sentence was longer than necessary? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, often receive longer sentences than violent offenders. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. Although she eventually breached my trust upon release, I do not believe the sentence was fair.
5136	Even when the sentence was initially longer, non-violent drug offenders can often receive harsher punishments than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20-year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram; however, I still do not believe it was fair that she served such an extended period.
5137	Even when the sentence was initially longer for non-violent drug offenders than for violent criminals, these offenders still need rehabilitation rather than being housed with other criminals. I worked for several years to secure parole for a woman who had been imprisoned for 20 years for possessing only 2/3rds of a gram of a drug. Although I was hurt by this, I do not believe the sentence was fair.
5138	Even when the sentence was initially longer, non-violent drug offenders often receive longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20-year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram, even though she ultimately betrayed me and caused me deep hurt. I still do not believe it was fair that she served such an extended period of time.
5139	Even when the initial sentence was unreasonable, non-violent drug offenders can often receive longer sentences than violent offenders. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20-year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram; while I believe her sentence was unfair, I was still deeply hurt by her actions upon release.
5140	Were you eligible for unemployment benefits? If not, you could face criminal charges, as this is generally a felony in most states. It is likely that the government will eventually become aware of this situation and take action to rectify it. In some states, employers must report new employees to the government due to child support laws. This is typically a way for them to detect such cases. Additionally, the government may identify these situations due to W-2 forms filed in your husband's and/or your name.
5141	Were you eligible for unemployment? If not, you could face legal consequences such as a felony in most states. It is advisable to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Moreover, the IRS will also be aware of your W-2 forms being filed in your husband’s or your name.
5145	I understand that the state places a financial burden on their departments when it comes to children in foster care. My sister is a caseworker and she has approximately 50 cases, which she is supposed to visit, as well as the parents, supervise visits, and attend court hearings for. Unfortunately, there is not enough funding to hire enough caseworkers, so the cases per worker ratio is too high.
5146	i don't know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care.  it COSTS the state tons of money.  my sister does this for a living and their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed.  the workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads the situation is not going to improve.  it's really sad.  my sister alone has about 50 cases and she's supposed to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them.  there's just not enough hours in a day.  each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people.  i hope your situation works out.
5147	I understand that the costs of providing care for abused children can put a strain on resources. From my experience, my sister’s department is understaffed and underfunded. The workers do their best, but until more money is invested in protecting children, the situation is unlikely to improve. It is truly sad. My sister has approximately 50 cases and she is supposed to visit the foster home, parents, and children, as well as attend court hearings for each of them. There just is not enough time in the day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases, but there is not enough funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation improves.
5148	I understand that the state has limited resources and that funding for child protection is insufficient. However, it is still expensive for the state to provide foster care and maintain cases, which can put a strain on resources. My sister works in the field and she has told me that the situation is not improving fast enough; courts and visits are extremely time-consuming and there is not enough funding to hire more people. It is unfortunate that the situation is not improving faster.
5149	I understand the challenges that the state faces in providing adequate care for abused children. My sister works in the field and she often has around 50 cases, which she has to visit the foster home, parents, supervise visits and attend court hearings for. There simply is not enough time in the day. Funding needs to be increased in order to hire more workers and make the system more manageable.
5150	I'm not sure I exactly understand the supposition you're making. In general, however, I would argue that moral and legal concepts are interlinked; laws and regulations are designed to promote societal values and maintain justice. While laws can address both moral and legal issues, as stated, laws cannot dictate morality.
5151	I understand the general idea, however I would argue that moral and legal actions can be viewed as part of a Venn diagram - an act can be both, one of the other, or neither. This is why we have laws and regulations in place to protect society and provide a sense of security.
5152	I think there is potential for a relationship between morality and legality, although this relationship may be more complex than a Venn diagram. We may not want it any other way; for example, it may be difficult to legislate morality.
5153	I think the relationship between morality and legality can be seen as a Venn diagram. There is some overlap, as certain acts can be both moral and legal, legal only, or moral only, but these should remain dictated by laws and social norms.
5154	I agree that legal and moral rules can be intertwined. Generally, however, I would argue that an act can be both legal and moral, legal and ethical, or neither. We want our legal system to protect us while leaving certain decisions up to individuals and communities, which is why we have laws in place.
5155	I prefer to contact a professional who specializes in the type of work I need done, such as an electrician for electrical work, rather than take a risk with my own DIY efforts.
5156	I usually call a professional electrician to fix my plumbing since it is beyond my expertise. I believe it is best to get the job done correctly the first time instead of risking further damage by doing it myself.
5157	I prefer to call a professional to handle my plumbing and electrical needs since I'm not experienced in that area.
5158	I prefer to leave plumbing repairs to the professionals, as it is often better to have an expert diagnose and fix the issue. Electricity and plumbing are two separate fields, so I generally call an electrician for plumbing repairs.
5159	My electrician is more specialized in electrical work and plumbing is outside his area of expertise. It makes sense for me to contact a specialist for such jobs.
5160	I am Canadian, and while there are some aspects of the US that I admire, I feel that the Iraq war was a mistake. Civilian casualties are a tragedy.
5161	I am Canadian and very proud of that fact. There are aspects of the United States that I admire, such as its innovation and technology, but there are also things I do not appreciate or admire, such as the war in Iraq.
5162	I am Canadian and very proud of that fact. There are things I admire and envy about the USA, but I do not appreciate or admire the war in Iraq. It was a huge mistake to go in and incur such civilian casualties.
5163	I am proud to be Canadian, and there are certain aspects of the United States that I admire, but there are also things I do not agree with, such as the war in Iraq. I think it was a mistake to intervene in this way.
5164	I am Canadian and very proud of that fact. There are things I admire and envy about the USA, such as their political structure and economic opportunity, but there are also things I do not appreciate or admire, such as the war in Iraq. I believe it was a mistake to go in and incur those civilian casualties.
5165	In Michigan, the legal drinking age is 21, and the state has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
5166	In Michigan, underage drinking is illegal and will result in punishment as the law states. The law does not have exemptions for minimal amounts or for minor offenses; the consequences are the same for all offenses.
5167	If you live in Michigan, underage consumption of alcohol is punishable by law. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
5168	In Michigan, zero tolerance is enforced for underage drinking; minors can face consequences such as fines and the loss of their driving privileges if convicted of minor in possession of alcohol.
5169	In Michigan, the legal drinking age is 21, and underage consumption of alcohol is illegal. Therefore, underage consumption is punished severely in Michigan, with fines and potential license suspension being possible penalties.
5170	Yes, I understand that there are laws in place to protect people from certain forms of speech which could be seen as a threat or cause harm to another person. However, I believe that it is important to have the right to say what you want, as long as it does not cross certain boundaries.
5171	Yes, it is true that there are limits on our right to freedom of expression. Generally, we can express ourselves freely, however, laws are in place to protect people from harm. Laws may restrict speech in order to prevent incitement of violence or discrimination. Furthermore, governments are increasingly imposing restrictions on certain types of speech, such as in relation to national security, data protection, and copyright. It is important to note that these laws are in place to protect people's rights and liberties.
5172	You should be able to express yourself, within limits. In some countries, laws have been passed that restrict certain types of speech in order to protect certain rights and liberties. Generally, these laws have been passed in order to stop speech that could lead to violence or other forms of harm. Where these laws are in place, they are designed to protect citizens from potential harm. Ultimately, it is up to the government to decide where to draw the line.
5173	The government may impose limits on speech in order to protect public safety and order, but these limits must be drawn carefully to ensure that individuals are able to exercise their right to freedom of expression. In some cases, such as shouting ‘fire’ in a crowded theatre, laws may be put in place to prevent such behaviour. However, laws that restrict speech should not be extended to stop people from thinking certain thoughts.
5174	Okay, I could understand not being able to criminally threaten someone or attempt to intimidate them, but other than that you should be able to express yourself.  While the government may place limits on speech in order to protect certain interests, such as public safety, I believe that individuals should have the right to say what they want, as long as it does not violate the rights or liberties of others.  In cases of extreme speech, laws can be put in place to protect citizens and prevent harm.
5175	Depending on what you are going for, and the impression you want to make, your choice of attire could vary. If you are looking to give the impression of a responsible and law-abiding citizen, then it might be best to opt for traditional clothing. On the other hand, if you are less concerned with making an impression, the Birkins could be a good choice.
5176	Depending on what you’re going for, and the impression you’re trying to make, you may want to opt for something more traditional if you want to be let off the hook. Otherwise, you may choose the Birks if you don’t care about the impression you’re making.
5177	Depending on what you're going for and the impression you want to make, it might be better to opt for something more traditional if that suits your preferences better. If you want to give the impression that you are a law-abiding citizen, it might be better to choose something more traditional. If you do not care about the impression you want to make, it might be better to choose the Birkins, as you prefer.
5178	Depending on what you are going for and the impression you want to make, it is best to choose something traditional if you want to be let off the hook. However, if you don't care about the impression you are making, it is best to choose the Birks.
5179	Depending on the situation, choosing a traditional style of court shoe could be more appropriate than a Birkenstock-style sandal. If you are trying to give the impression of being a responsible, law-abiding citizen, a more traditional court shoe could be a better choice. However, if you are less concerned about the impression you are making, a Birkenstock-style sandal could be preferable.
5180	Having everyone's details on a database could be a good way of preventing crime in the future, but it is a big violation of personal rights. It will be important to have regulations in place to ensure that our privacy is respected, as this could be a difficult issue to monitor. We will need to wait and see if it has the desired effect.     It is important to note that fingerprinting and DNA testing has already been implemented in some countries and it has helped reduce crime rates. This could be a successful approach to lowering crime in the future.
5181	Having everyone's details on a database can be seen as an invasion of privacy. We still have the right to privacy, and the Government could gain access to our data at any time, which could lead to potential abuse. In terms of the microchipping, this would be forced upon people without their consent, which could be seen as a violation of personal rights.
5182	Civil rights- we are innocent until proved guilty, and having everyone on a database could be beneficial in reducing crime. In some cases, it could even have a positive effect, with the authorities able to monitor the database more closely. Though it might be a violation of personal rights in some cases, it could be beneficial in the long run.
5183	Civil rights- we are innocent until proved guilty, and having everyone on a database could have some benefits, however it is a violation of personal rights. For example, if biometric ID cards are implemented, we may see a decrease in crime rates, as it would be easier to monitor the crime rates. It is difficult to predict the effects for sure.
5184	Civil rights- we are innocent until proved guilty, and having everyone on a database could have both positive and negative effects. It could reduce crime rates, but there are privacy concerns as well. There is also the issue of who will monitor the database and ensure that it is secure.
5185	I believe that drug abusers should be sent to rehab centers if they have committed crimes to support their addiction, as well as serving prison time for the crimes. However, the length of the sentence should depend on the severity of the crime. For drug abuse, rehab should be the primary form of punishment.   For murderers and rapists, I believe that sentencing should be harsher and that capital punishment should be implemented more effectively.
5186	I believe that drug abusers should receive treatment rather than prison time, depending on the severity of their crime. Drug dealers should face more significant penalties, but the punishment should be tailored to the circumstances. Rehab should be offered as an option for those addicted to drugs.   For murderers and rapists, sentences should be made more severe and the legal system should ensure that justice is served quickly and efficiently. Capital punishment should be implemented more rigorously.
5187	I think people who are convicted of drug abuse should receive rehab rather than prison time, as rehab programs are more effective in treating addiction than jail time. Furthermore, if the individual has committed crimes to support their addiction, imprisonment should be followed by rehab in order to address the drug abuse.  For murderers and rapists, more stringent sentencing is necessary to ensure justice is served. Capital punishment should be enforced more quickly and efficiently, with the death penalty not taking more than 30 years to go through the legal system.
5188	I believe that those who abuse drugs should be sent to rehab centers, depending on the severity of their crime. In some cases, imprisonment may be appropriate for the criminal activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse. However, murderers and rapists should face harsher sentencing, and capital punishment should be carried out more efficiently.
5189	I believe that those who abuse drugs should be given the chance to receive treatment in rehabilitation centers instead of prison, depending on the severity of the case. Drug dealers should face prison sentences, but the punishment should fit the circumstances. Dealing with drug abuse can lead to criminal activity, in which case incarceration should be followed by rehabilitation for the drug abuse.   For murderers and rapists, I believe that sentences should be harsher and that capital punishment needs to be enforced more efficiently. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
5190	It could lead to an increase in use, which could potentially cause a range of health, social and economic problems. This could strain healthcare resources and labor markets, as well as increase the availability of other drugs and crime.
5191	It is important to consider the potential impacts of legalizing marijuana, such as increased health care costs, decreased labor quality, and increased crime. While regulation could help mitigate some of these impacts, marijuana legalization could potentially create initial surges in interest, which could lead to higher costs and affect labor and community quality of life.
5192	It's not advisable to legalize marijuana due to its potential effects on public health and the economy. Marijuana can damage the respiratory system and impair judgment, leading to increased health care costs. Additionally, legalizing marijuana would cause an initial surge in interest, as well as a need for marijuana dealers to find alternative sources of income. This could lead to an increase in crime.
5193	It could lead to increased health costs and decreased labor quality, as well as increased demand for other types of drugs and crime if legalized. This could have a negative long-term impact on society.
5194	It is difficult to regulate the use of marijuana as a legal substance, as it could lead to increased health care costs and decreased labor quality, as well as increased crime. Marijuana can be a gateway drug that leads to other, more dangerous substance use, and its legalization could have an initial high level of interest that could negatively impact public health.
5195	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other?   If it involves two minors engaging in consensual sex, the laws should be less strict than they are now. Minors should have the right to make their own decisions regarding their sexuality, as long as it is legal in the given jurisdiction.
5196	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other?  If it involves two minors together, the laws should be less strict than they are now; the law should take into account the fact that minors are still able to make their own decisions, at least in some cases.
5197	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? In some countries, the legal age of consent for sexual activity is 16 or 18, but in other countries it may be lower. It is important to consider the laws of the country, as well as the potential impact of the activity on the minors involved. Some countries may have laws in place that are less strict than others.
5198	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other?  If it involves two minors together, the laws should be less strict than they are now, as minors should have the right to decide what to do with their bodies. However, this may depend on the age difference between the two minors and the nature of the sexual activity.
5199	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? If it involves two minors together, then the laws should be less strict than they are now, as it may not be in the best interests of the minors to prosecute them for something that is not considered a crime in most jurisdictions.
5200	If all is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you could not venture off on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. 18 is the adult age, but there are exceptions to the laws in some areas. If you go and live with a relative, a guardianship contract would need to be amended by both parties, your parents and your live-in relatives or adults in charge. However, I think the laws will be fairly lenient with you since you are only a year away from adulthood. Just pack your bags, and with your mom’s blessing, go off and find your destiny. Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
5201	If everything is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you could not venture off on your own!  Check the local laws and statutes in your town.  Generally 18 is the legal age of adulthood, but there are exceptions to the laws in some areas.  If you go live with a relative and you are “underage,” then a guardianship contract would have to be amended by both parties, as well as your parents and your live-in relatives or adult-head of house.  However, I personally believe that this would not be a major issue in the grand scheme of things.  Therefore, I believe that you should still have the opportunity to pursue your own dreams!  Enjoy your independence while you can, and have fun exploring your future. 😀
5202	If all is well between you and your mother, I see no reason why you could not venture out on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. In most cases, 18 is the adult age, although there are exceptions in some areas. If you move in with a relative, a guardianship contract would need to be amended by both parties, as well as your parents and the relative's or adult's head of household. I would say that, at 18, it might be possible for you to move away, though this would depend on a variety of factors.  I believe that you should go for it and make the most of this opportunity! Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
5203	If everything is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you cannot move out on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. 18 is the legal age of adulthood in most states, but there are exceptions in some areas. If you plan to live with a relative, you and the relative should agree on a guardianship contract, as well as get the approval of your parents and the relative’s adult-head of house. I believe that the law will not be too stringent regarding just being one year shy of adulthood. Go ahead and live your dream, and stay out of trouble, okay?  Take the chance while you can!
5204	If everything is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you could not venture off on your own! Check the local laws and statutes in your area. 18 is the adult age, but there are exceptions to the law in some areas. If you move in with a relative, a guardianship contract would have to be amended by both parties, your parents and the relative's or adult-head of house. However, I believe that 18 is young enough to be legally considered an adult in most states. I would encourage you to explore your options and make your own path!
5205	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off... I favour harvesting of stem cells from donated cord blood and see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
5206	I believe that there are viable alternatives to using embryonic cells for stem cell research, such as those found in cord blood donations. This is due to the fact that these cells are widely available and have shown tremendous promise in terms of research potential. Furthermore, this would eliminate any ethical concerns that could arise from using embryonic cells.
5207	Since cord blood contains many of the same types of stem cells as embryonic stem cells, there is no need to use embryos to do the research that holds such promise. I also believe that umbilical cord blood is a viable alternative source of stem cells for research.
5208	Stem cells can be derived from cord blood just as effectively as from embryos, so there is no need to use embryos for research. As a pro-choice advocate, I believe that parents should have the right to choose whether or not to keep their baby, and I also believe that research can progress without the need to create embryos.
5209	Since umbilical cord blood contains many of the same stem cells as embryonic cells, it is possible to conduct research using cord blood without the need to use embryonic cells. Although this is possible, it is not necessary and I believe that using cord blood is preferable to using embryos for research that holds such promise.
5210	I believe that imposing the death penalty is a cruel punishment as it takes away an offender's right to live. Additionally, I think the difference between the crime and the law should be taken into consideration; if I were facing life imprisonment, I would prefer the death penalty, as it offers the offender a chance to redeem themselves and their family. Furthermore, in my country, we have abolished the death penalty, which provides offenders with the opportunity to live with their consequences for the rest of their lives.
5211	I believe that imposing the death penalty is not the ideal punishment for murder as it does not differentiate between the crime and the law; I would prefer life imprisonment, as it offers some form of solace that the criminal will have to face the consequences of their crime for the rest of their life. In my country, we have abolished the death penalty and given the convicts a chance to live with the consequences of their crimes. Although this runs counter to our ideals as a nation, it gives us a chance to promote modern, liberal values to the rest of the world.
5212	I believe that making murder punishable by life imprisonment is a joke; what is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are committing murder? Moreover, if I were facing life imprisonment, I would prefer the death penalty, as I'm sure many people on death row see it that way. Fortunately, in my country we have abolished the death penalty, and offenders now have to face their nightmares for the rest of their lives. We are supposed to be promoting modern, liberal western values to the rest of the world, but this is not the case.
5213	I think having the government impose the death penalty is a joke; what is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are committing murder? As I would prefer in such a situation, life in prison is better than the death penalty as I am sure many people on death row see it that way. Fortunately, my country abolished the death penalty long ago and prisoners now have to face their horrors for the rest of their lives rather than getting an easy way out. We are supposed to be promoting modern, liberal Western values to the rest of the world, but it is not always the case in the West’s leading nation.
5214	I believe that making murder punishable by death is a joke; what is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are committing murder? Additionally, if I were facing life in prison, I would prefer the death penalty, as it provides some closure and finality for the victim’s family and prevents the killer from living with their nightmares for the rest of their life. It also offers a form of justice that allows society to maintain its standards.
5215	Is this a question, or a US bashing, I'm not sure. It is true that we have the power to control technology and proliferation, as we see it as a danger. This is because we have the ability to wreak havoc on a global scale. Although having nukes present the risk of an accidental detonation, we should still keep these weapons under tight control. In general, it is better to have less access to nuclear weapons, rather than every country having them.
5216	Is this a question, or a US-bashing? There are pros and cons to having nuclear weapons, as well as the ability to control their proliferation. The US sees nuclear weapons as a threat, as they could be used by other countries, which is why it is cautious about their spread. The US has the power to control it, but it is a difficult decision to make.
5217	Is this a question, or a US-positive viewpoint? I often ask myself that same question, and the most honest answer is that we decide whether or not to control nuclear proliferation based on our own security concerns and perceptions of other countries. The idea of every country having the capability to destroy the planet might seem daunting, but it is ultimately up to each country to decide if they think it is safe to have nuclear weapons.
5218	Yes, there are legitimate concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially given their potential for causing widespread destruction. While it may be possible to control the spread of these weapons, it is ultimately a decision that must be made by each country based on its own assessment of the risks.
5219	Is this a question, or a US bashing? While it is understandable to be wary of nuclear weapons and their potential proliferation, it is important to ensure that such weapons do not fall into the wrong hands. We have the power to control the spread of nuclear weapons, as we see it as a danger. Generally, it is better to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading to too many countries.
5220	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine. While the individuals you encounter may operate differently than those in the civilian world, law enforcement officers often work in teams and have the backing of supervisors and other officers. This can make situations safer for those on the scene. Additionally, size is not as much of a factor when it comes to law enforcement, as officers are often required to work with some sort of physical presence in order to make an arrest. This can help officers feel safer in the field.
5221	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine.  Be aware that the people you will deal with operate in a different reality than you and me.  They operate on the principle of the strong surviving, and power means everything.  I, as a smaller officer, have found that I have to deal with this more often, as the suspects know my size can pose a threat.  However, I have generally had back-up officers with me, which has helped. I have also had good experiences with these situations.  It pays to be aware of the nature of the people and the situation you may face.               It is worth noting that I have found that my training and education have enabled me to succeed.           With that said, I have found that I am able to do this job.           Thus, I believe that the size of an officer does not necessarily determine the difficulty of the job.
5222	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine. Remember that law enforcement officers are there to ensure public safety, and they often operate with backup when necessary. Be aware that the people you will deal with often operate in dangerous situations and they are used to dealing with such risks. Keep in mind that they rely on the training and size of officers to ensure their safety.
5223	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine. Bear in mind that the people you will deal with operate in a different reality than you and me. They have their own set of rules and powers dictate how things operate. It is likely that you will have backup officers with you most of the time. Be aware that the situation can escalate quickly and you may have to deal with violence. Be prepared and stay safe.
5224	Go out and join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training, you should do fine. Law enforcement can be a physically demanding job, so it is important to stay in good physical shape in order to protect yourself and ensure the safety of others. Know that there may be times when you are outnumbered by suspects, in which case you will likely be backed up by other officers. This is especially true when there are multiple arrests happening simultaneously. Be aware that the people you deal with may have a different nature than you and me, and that power often dictates the situation.
5225	I know it is a cliché, but India is far from poor. It is rich in history and has vast potential which can be tapped by improving education and providing job opportunities. If India is able to develop its human capital and create more job opportunities, it can make considerable progress in the future.
5226	I know it is a cliché, but India is not poor. It is rich in history and has a lot of potential that has not yet been tapped. India can become wealthy if its citizens are given more opportunities to learn and access better job prospects.
5227	I know it is a cliche, but India is not poor in terms of its history and culture; it is rich in terms of its history. The economy and job market of India can improve if its citizens have better access to education and skills that allow them to get higher paying jobs.
5228	I know it is a cliché, but India is more than just its economy. It has a rich history and culture, as well as a lot of potential in terms of resources and infrastructure. This can be tapped into if the government invests in education and job opportunities, which can lead to economic growth in the long run.
5229	I know it is a cliché, but India is much richer than many countries give it credit for. Yes, it has a long history and many resources, which can potentially lead to economic growth if the government invests in creating more jobs for its citizens. If India improves its infrastructure and provides better education, it can become much wealthier in the future.
5230	In some cases, individuals who are being questioned by police are granted the right to remain silent. This is because in the United States, individuals are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and questioning of suspects is allowed only if sufficient evidence exists. Generally, individuals are not required to answer questions directly, which gives authorities the opportunity to collect evidence without being interrogated.
5231	In some cases, individuals who are suspected of a crime are given the right to remain silent. This means that even though they have not been found guilty, their rights have not been taken away yet. When questioned, they are considered suspects until they are found guilty. While this is the case, officers may still force them to answer questions if they want to.
5232	In the US, when someone is being questioned by law enforcement, they have the right to remain silent. It is important to remember that a person is innocent until proven guilty; however, when law enforcement is questioning a suspect, they are treating the person as a suspect. In this situation, the individual may not want to talk, but may be forced to do so, leading to the wasting of law enforcement’s time.
5233	In the United States, individuals have the right to remain silent when questioned by law enforcement. While this right is generally understood, it is important to note that it is the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while an individual is presumed innocent until proven guilty. When an individual is questioned, they are considered suspects until proven otherwise. While an individual has the right to remain silent, it is important to remember that police officers’ time can still be wasted if they force an individual to answer questions they do not wish to.
5234	Without going into great detail, if you listen they say "You have the right to remain silent"  It's just the fact that it's their right to not have to say anything.  And when you are being questioned you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent.  At the time when they are questioning them they are suspects.  Additionally, if someone does not want to talk, they can refuse to speak, which may waste the police officer's time.
5235	If the person is mentally disabled and has a supporting diagnosis from a doctor, I do not believe the person should be prosecuted. However, if the guardian is responsible for the person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also believe hunger is a mitigating factor in any food theft situation.
5236	If the person has a mental disability that is supported by a doctor's diagnosis, then I do not believe the person should be prosecuted. However, if the person is under the care of another person, the caregiver may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also believe that the situation could be mitigated by the defendant's physical or mental health.
5237	If the person has a mental disability that is supported by a doctor's diagnosis, prosecution should be avoided. However, if the caretaker is held legally responsible for the person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I believe that the circumstances of the crime should be taken into account; hunger is a mitigating factor that could lessen the crime's severity.
5238	If the person is mentally disabled and has the support of a doctor's diagnosis, I do not believe that the person should be prosecuted. However, if the caregiver or guardian is responsible for the person, they could be held liable for not fully supervising. In these cases, I believe hunger should be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor.
5239	If a person has a diagnosed mental disability and is under the care of a doctor, prosecution should be avoided, in line with the legal system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. However, if the caregiver is held legally responsible for the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. Additionally, I believe hunger can be seen as a mitigating factor in food theft cases.
5240	Yes, school districts have the right to ensure that equipment is not being used for any illegal purpose. While students must sign an agreement to use school computers for email, they may be able to negotiate terms. If the terms are not agreeable, students may choose to forgo using the school's equipment. Additionally, school districts may monitor web sites visited by students or other users.
5241	No, you are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is not being used for any illegal purpose. If you do not agree to the terms of the contract, you may need to find alternative methods of accessing email. Schools may also monitor web sites visited by students or staff.
5242	The school has the right to ensure that its equipment is not being used for any illegal purpose. If you do not agree to the terms of the contract, you may choose to forgo using the school computers for emails. They may also monitor web sites accessed by pupils or staff.
5243	Yes, the school has the right to ensure that equipment provided for student use complies with the terms of the contract the student signs. If the student does not agree with the terms, they may choose to forgo using school computers for emails. The school may also monitor the websites visited by students or other users.
5244	The school has the right to ensure that its equipment is not used for any illegal purpose. If you do not agree to the terms of the contract, you may decide to stop using school computers for emails. They can also monitor the websites you visit, or those visited by pupils.
5245	In Europe, alcohol is often seen as a more acceptable part of culture, which means that attitudes towards it among younger generations are often more positive. This could be due to more education and awareness from a younger age about the risks of alcohol consumption. This could help reduce the need for many teenagers to drink large amounts in order to feel the effects. Additionally, the ads that link beer with being sexy do not accurately reflect this, as alcohol consumption generally does not make you more attractive.
5246	In Europe, alcohol is often seen as a normal part of life, which means that people are more open to its use and less likely to view it as taboo. This means that teenagers may be more inclined to drink in smaller amounts, allowing them to experience the effects of alcohol without overdoing it. Similarly, advertisements may create the impression that drinking alcohol can make one more attractive, which could potentially influence younger consumers to do so.
5247	In Europe, alcohol is often viewed as a part of culture and celebration, which makes it less taboo among younger generations. This difference in education may explain why American teenagers often feel pressured to drink more for peer acceptance, as well as the prevalence of alcohol-related advertisements that link drinking with being sexy.
5248	In Europe, alcohol is generally viewed as a social beverage that can be enjoyed responsibly. This contrasts with the American attitude towards alcohol, where it is often seen as taboo and not treated with respect. This could lead to teenagers drinking more heavily in an attempt to get a taste for it, which can be unsafe. Additionally, advertising often makes it seem like drinking alcohol can lead to being sexy, which is not the case.
5249	In Europe, alcohol is more widely accepted and viewed as a legal substance, leading to fewer taboos around it. Additionally, many advertisements link drinking beer with being sexy, which can give the impression that alcohol is seen as attractive in American culture. This could be why teenagers feel more inclined to drink until they become sick.
5250	I believe 18 is a reasonable age to become legally eligible to vote and serve in the military; by this age, individuals have typically completed high school and have been living under their own legal authority for some time. It allows them to take on greater responsibilities and participate more actively in society.
5251	I believe 18 is a good age to be legally able to vote and fight in wars, as these are important responsibilities. It is true that minors may still be able to access alcohol, but drinking age should be regulated in order to prevent underage drinking.
5252	I believe 18 is an appropriate age to obtain the rights and responsibilities of adulthood, such as finishing high school and having more independent rights under the law. It is important to gain this independence and autonomy at an early age, so that individuals are prepared to assume more responsibilities later on. With regards to voting, although it may seem that a younger age group is not prepared to make such decisions, legal age should be 18.
5253	I would argue that 18 is a reasonable age to become legally independent; by this age, individuals have completed their secondary education and have had some experience living on their own, giving them a reasonable degree of autonomy. Additionally, by this age, individuals should have gained the necessary legal protections, such as the right to vote and to serve in the military.
5254	I believe 18 is the right age to gain the rights of adulthood, such as voting and fighting in wars. Being 18 offers a person more autonomy and responsibility, which is important in order to become a full adult. Drinking alcohol can be difficult for underage people, but it is not hard to access if one wants to do so.
5255	No, he's already stretched too thin in California.  Besides, we have a president now who is not fully prepared to handle the presidency's challenges - and I do not want to repeat that again.  Being president of a country should require being a legal resident of the country, in my opinion.
5256	No, he's already overextended in California, which could pose potential risks to the effectiveness of his presidency.  Additionally, we currently have a president in office who is still learning the ropes of the job, and I believe it is best to avoid replicating this situation again.  While the presidency should be based in the candidate's home country, other jobs can be filled by anyone with legal status.
5257	No, he's already overextended in California.  Plus, I think it is important for the President of a country to be born in the country, as this gives them a deeper understanding of the culture and politics of the nation.  Having the President of a nation be based in the country's capital can be beneficial in many ways.
5258	No, he's already overextended in California.  Additionally, we have a president now who is not fully prepared to handle the duties of the presidency--I do not want to repeat that scenario again.  In my opinion, the president of a country should be born in that country, as the presidential role requires a greater level of authority and responsibility. Other jobs can be taken by anyone with legal status.
5259	No, he's already overextended in California.  Additionally, we already have a President in office who has had difficulties navigating the Presidency - and I do not want to repeat that again.  Having the President of a country be born in the country is important; other jobs can be held by anyone with legal status.
5260	I certainly believe that it should be legalized. This removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the situation, as well as providing a measure of safety by ensuring that prostitutes are regularly tested for diseases.
5261	I believe that legalization of prostitution is a positive step as it removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the situation, while also ensuring that prostitutes are regularly tested for diseases. This provides a safer environment for everyone involved.
5262	I believe that legalizing prostitution would be beneficial, as this removes much of the mystery and shadiness from the situation. Also, in areas where it is legal, the prostitutes are usually tested for diseases on a regular basis, which is a major plus.
5263	I believe that the legalization of prostitution could help to make the situation safer for everyone involved. Testing for diseases on a regular basis helps to minimize this risk.
5264	I believe that legalizing prostitution can help to reduce the mystique and sordidness of the industry, as well as ensure that prostitutes are tested for diseases regularly, which solves a major problem.
5265	I believe that this offers several benefits compared to the death penalty, such as:   * The state does not have to carry out the execution.   * The accused person is given a choice, preserving their freedom of choice.   * The choice of life imprisonment can be renewed periodically, making it less inhumane.   * Suicide should be left to the convict's choice.
5266	I believe that this solution presents several advantages, such as limiting the state's involvement in capital punishment cases, providing the accused with the choice to live or die, preserving their freedom of will and presenting them with the option to end their life again periodically. It also gives them the option to take their own life if they choose. This helps to ensure that the punishment is not inhumane.
5267	I believe that this provides several benefits to the state, including the preservation of life and limb of citizens.  The death penalty offers the possibility of wrongful executions, as well as limiting the freedoms of the convicts. Therefore, I feel that presenting them with a choice is more humane than executing them against their will. Furthermore, the state should always give the convict the option of repealing their life imprisonment if they so choose.
5268	I believe that this system provides a number of benefits.   * The state's hands are kept clean, so that the death penalty cannot be carried out.  * An innocent person has the choice of life imprisonment, giving them the possibility of being released if new evidence comes to light.  * The convict still has the choice of life imprisonment, which I believe to be important.  * The life imprisonment is not inhumane, as the convict has the option to choose it again every five years or so.  * The convict has the freedom to choose how they end their life.   * The death penalty is not carried out, thus preventing any form of punishment.  * Additionally, the state has the power to decide the punishment.
5269	I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.  * The state's hands are kept clean.  * An innocent person will always have the option of appealing the sentence, so new evidence may come to light that proves their innocence. This prevents the death penalty from being enforced on innocent people.  * The convict's freedom of choice is respected, which I consider to be important.  * Life imprisonment should give the convict the option to reconsider every few years or so, which makes it less inhumane.  * Suicide should be left as an individual choice.
5270	We are born, we live, and we die, which are constants in our life. We know that these things will happen, so why should we bother to do anything? Why should we work a job that we have no interest in or keep in touch with people if we are in a transition phase? That is what I am facing right now, and while it is understandable that one withdraws from society during such times, life still needs meaning.
5271	We’re born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our life. We know that these things are going to happen. However, we have the freedom to make choices in life about what we want to do, including whether to work a particular job and maintain social connections. There may be times when we feel disconnected from society, but it is important to stay connected in order to get the fulfillment and meaning we need from our lives.
5272	We’re born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our life. We know that these things are going to happen. So what is the point of being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? Dealing with societal strife is difficult and life is often uncertain. I may choose to withdraw from society and immerse myself in activities that provide meaning and purpose.
5273	We’re born, we live, and we die. These are the constants in our lives, but we can still find meaning in our experiences, even if we don’t always understand the reasons for our struggles. It’s natural to want to take a break from society at times, but I believe it’s important to stay connected in order to feel a sense of belonging and purpose. We may not realize it, but connecting with people and investing in meaningful experiences can offer new depths of understanding and fulfillment.
5274	We are all faced with the challenges of life, which can be difficult and often unexpected. Despite this, we know that certain constants remain in our lives, such as death and transition. We have a choice to make between certain opportunities, and it is understandable that one might feel hesitant or uncertain about these decisions. It is important to have a sense of purpose and motivation when making these choices, as it helps to give meaning and context to our lives. While dealing with societal struggles can be difficult, it is important to maintain connections with society and our surroundings in order to make the most of our lives.
5275	Although there is value in striving for improvement and becoming the best version of oneself, it is important to recognize that this process of self-improvement should not come at the cost of other people. Having an open attitude to growth and change can allow individuals to progress without hindering their relationships with others or the progress of their communities.
5276	While there is value in striving to improve oneself and make life better for one’s descendants, it is also important to balance this with accepting and celebrating who one is as an individual. Society has made progress by recognizing this and embracing uniqueness, which can be beneficial in the long run.
5277	Many people benefit from having a growth mindset, in which they believe that they can develop and improve themselves. This can give people the motivation to strive for excellence and progress in life. However, this can be difficult if society imposes rigid standards, which can prevent individuals from reaching their full potential. It is important for individuals to have the autonomy and freedom to decide what is best for their future and that of their descendants.
5278	"Be yourself" attitude can be beneficial for individuals, as it encourages people to explore their own potential and develop their skills, rather than simply copying what others do. It also allows people to think beyond their own lifes and strive for better lives for their descendants.
5279	Having an “be yourself” attitude can be beneficial for people as it allows them to embrace their unique qualities and explore their identity. However, this can be dangerous as it could lead to making choices that could hinder growth and development if not moderated by outside factors. It is important to strive for improvement and perfection in order to ensure a better future for generations to come.
5280	In some countries, women now have equal rights and opportunities as men in the workplace. Laws have been passed to ensure that women are paid the same as men for equivalent work and childcare facilities have been improved to make it easier for parents to balance work and family life. Additionally, domestic violence laws have been strengthened to better protect women from violence. These laws and policies are making a positive impact on women’s rights and creating a more equal society.
5281	In order to provide an inclusive environment that allows everyone to feel safe and respected, changes should be made to ensure that gender equality is upheld. These changes could include increasing gender sensitivity training for students and staff, creating gender-neutral policies, and providing support services to ensure equal opportunities for both genders.
5282	I understand the importance of respecting everyone's gender equality, however, I believe that women should be afforded the same respect and courtesy as men when it comes to their personal space.  I believe that more can be done to educate people on this, as well as implementing policies that make these efforts more visible.
5283	Today, I opened the door for a girl and was met with an icy reception. In some societies, this is considered to be an act of courtesy to let females know when they can enter a space. This is an example of how attitudes towards gender equality are changing, albeit slowly, and more needs to be done to promote equal access for women.
5284	Today I opened the door for a girl and was met with a scream. While I believe that women deserve equality and respect, this was a very extreme reaction and I think a better way to achieve this would be to educate people and create awareness so that these attitudes can change over time.
5285	You have no control over what city or country you're from, nor do you have control over what skin color you are. It seems silly to me to cheer for a team simply because of their nationality or the fact that they are the only team left in the running. It is understandable to cheer for a team if you have an emotional connection to it, but it is limiting to only cheer for one team if you do not have that connection.
5286	You have no control over what city or country you’re from, or what color your skin is. However, it makes sense to cheer for a team if you have a personal connection to it - hockey is a great example as the Montreal Canadiens are the only Canadian team left in the Stanley Cup race. We can still cheer for teams we have a personal connection to, even if it is not the team from our own country.
5287	You have no control over what city or country you're from, nor over what color your skin is. It seems odd to me to cheer for a team simply because of where they're from or how they play - it's important to consider both factors when deciding who to root for. For example, I'm Canadian and the Montreal Canadiens are the only Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race. Most people I know have started cheering for them as a result, which feels somewhat forced to me.
5288	You have no control over what city or country you’re from, nor do you have control over what colour your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they’re from and not how they play. For example, if I’m Canadian, I would cheer for the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley Cup race since they are the only Canadian team left – this is a personal preference that could change if another team performs better.
5289	You have no control over where you're from or what colour your skin is, but that does not stop people from getting passionate about teams they've grown up with, or cheering for them when they perform well. That is a matter of personal preference, and it does not diminish the performance of another team.
5290	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not provide its citizens with adequate opportunities and I do not think it is moving in the direction of reaching an equilibrium where it can provide better living conditions for its citizens.   The culture has continued to move in the wrong direction, with generations becoming more and more programmed to accept the current system. This leads to people having difficulty making ends meet.   I believe the two countries should be united and the current system in South Korea should be accepted.
5291	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not provide its citizens with adequate resources and opportunities to live a dignified life. I believe that a united Korea, with the South Korean system being accepted, would offer a better outcome than the current situation.
5292	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not work to the betterment of its citizens, and I do not believe it is heading in the direction of reaching some sort of equilibrium. The culture is continuing to move in the wrong direction, with generations becoming more and more programmed to accept this.  I believe that the two countries should be unified, and the South Korean system should be accepted.
5293	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not provide citizens with the best possible opportunities. I do not believe that it will move in a direction that allows for equilibrium to be reached, as the culture continues to move in the wrong direction and people become more and more programmed to accept this. In my opinion, a unification of the two countries should take place, allowing the South Korean system to be accepted.
5294	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not appear to be heading in a direction that would benefit its citizens over time. I believe that there should be greater unity between the two countries, and the South Korean system should be accepted.
5295	I understand the sentiment behind the #BringBackOurGirls campaign and acknowledge the horror of the situation. However, I believe that it could potentially increase the effects of terrorism by drawing attention to the attacks and keeping the events in the public consciousness. Ultimately, this does not change anything and could inhibit any positive change.
5296	Surely the whole #BringBackOurGirls campaign is admirable, as it creates awareness and keeps the situation in the public consciousness. Although it may not have an immediate effect, it does keep the issue in people's minds, which could potentially lead to change over time.
5297	I understand the sentiment behind the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, but I believe that it could potentially increase the terrorists' power and promote the act of terrorism. Moreover, it does not have the power to directly influence change in the situation.
5298	Surely the whole #BringBackOurGirls campaign is admirable and important. While it may not necessarily change anything, it brings attention to an issue and keeps it in the public consciousness. From a humanitarian perspective, this can be beneficial in the long run, even if there are no immediate solutions. However, I recognize that it may not work in every instance.
5299	Surely bringing attention to the abduction of the girls is important to keep pressure on the government and increase the chances of their release. This could help ensure that the girls are safe and returned to their families in the future. Although the situation is undoubtedly disturbing, raising awareness of it can increase the probability of a positive outcome.
5300	I believe we should invest research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun over time. We could perform this mission once or twice a year, where we can be certain it would land. We could also put it in a container strong enough to survive the journey, and fire it at Earths escape velocity to ensure this.
5301	I think we should look into placing research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. The trash could disintegrate before it even arrives at the sun, and it might be possible to do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. However, it might be better to just fire it into the vast openness of space. In terms of scale, it is highly unlikely it would hit anything within several hundred years. We should put the trash in a strong container that could withstand the journey out of Earth’s atmosphere.
5302	I think research should be put into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun or into space in general. It could disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun, so we could be certain it would not hit anything for hundreds of years. We could fire it with enough power to reach Earth’s escape velocity in a container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere.  Additionally, we could shoot it into space once or twice a year to ensure it would land.
5303	I think we should consider researching ways to shoot large amounts of trash into the sun or space in general. The trash could disintegrate before it even reaches the sun over a period of years. We could do it only once or twice a year with confidence that it will land. However, we should explore other alternatives such as firing it into the vast emptiness of space. In terms of scale, it is highly unlikely to cause any harm within several hundred years. We could construct a container that can withstand the force of Earth's escape velocity.
5304	I think it would be beneficial to conduct research into shooting trash into the sun or space in general. The trash would disintegrate before it reached the sun, and it is unlikely that it would hit anything within several hundred years. We need only to shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, in a sturdy container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere.
5305	I know that with science, many couples are now able to have children. However, I believe that this is self-indulgent; many children around the world are available for adoption, and it can cost up to $3,000 to use a surrogate, which I feel is too high. Surrogacy agencies tend to be based in foreign countries, where the women are often paid very little for using their bodies to give birth. This does not seem right to me.
5306	I know that with modern science, it is now possible to have children, but I think it is selfish to spend over $3000 to use a surrogate when there are thousands of orphans around the world who could be adopted. Additionally, the success of surrogacy agencies is in foreign countries where they can pay the women so little since the baby is essentially a business transaction for them. Childbirth is physically demanding for women, so using their body to give birth to a child they may never see again does not seem right.
5307	I know that with science most people are now able to have children, which can be costly. However, I think this is largely self-determined, as the cost of surrogacy can vary significantly depending on the country and the mother's needs. Additionally, the process of giving birth can take a lot out of a woman physically, so knowing that a woman goes through this just to give birth to a child she may never see again does not sit right with me.
5308	I know that with science most people are now able to have children, which is a positive development. However, I believe it is important to consider the adoption options that are available. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are in need of homes, and spending around $3000 to use a surrogate might not be the best use of resources. Furthermore, surrogacy agencies are typically based in foreign countries, meaning that the women are oftentimes paid less than what is fair for their services. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically and emotionally, which makes it difficult to cope with a child that one may never get to see again.
5309	I know that with science most people are now able to have children, but I feel that it is too expensive and potentially exploitative. It can cost around $3000 to use a surrogate, and that seems excessive to me. Additionally, surrogacy agencies are more prevalent in foreign countries, where the women are often paid very little for their bodies being used. Childbirth takes a lot out of a woman physically, and knowing that a woman goes through that just to give birth to a child they may never see again seems wrong.
5310	Polyamory has become more accepted in our society in recent years, and I have personally seen an increase in the positive comments about it in the media. This indicates to me that attitudes are shifting towards a more accepting view of polyamorous relationships. From my experience, it is possible to have a fulfilling, healthy polyamorous relationship, and I have been in a long-term, stable and happy relationship with two men. Therefore, I believe that there is nothing objectively wrong with my relationships.
5311	From a societal perspective, polyamory is still relatively new and unfamiliar, which can lead to a lack of acceptance and understanding from those not in a polyamorous relationship. This means that opinions on polyamory tend to be mixed, as evidenced by the comments on media articles. While there is nothing objectively wrong with polyamory, it is a lifestyle choice that not everyone is comfortable with.
5312	From my experience, polyamory can work well for those involved as long as all parties are respectful of the relationship. I understand that it may be unconventional for some, but it seems to be working well for you and your partners. It is true that different relationships will suit different people better.
5313	Polyamory has become more accepted in our society, which has led to an increase in visibility in the media. While some people are still uncomfortable with the concept, it is becoming more accepted, particularly among younger generations. For those who are in a polyamorous relationship, the benefits of having more than one romantic relationship can bring many positive experiences. From the perspective of the articles, there is no right or wrong answer as to whether polyamory is acceptable or not, as it is ultimately a personal choice.
5314	Polyamory has been gaining more attention in the media recently, and I often read the comments on these articles. While there is a diverse range of opinions, the general sentiment tends to be negative, with comments such as “Nope” and “Ick” being the most common. I am in a polyamorous relationship with two men, and we are happy and healthy. We are not in a sexual relationship with each other, but our relationship is stable and long-term. While it is understandable that not everyone is comfortable with this type of relationship, there is nothing inherently wrong with it from an objective perspective.
5315	Marriage was more common in generations prior to World War II due to societal pressure and expectations. Divorce was uncommon at that time, indicating that couples were married younger, typically in their late teens or early twenties. People were expected to marry younger in order to comply with social norms.
5316	While marriage was more common in the 1920s and 1930s, many cultures expected couples to marry earlier and have children due to societal pressure. Divorce was uncommon at this time, making it difficult for couples who grew apart after marrying younger.
5317	All of my grandparents were born somewhere from the late 1920s to the end of the 1930s and according to most of what I've heard, marriage was often seen as a societal expectation at that time. People were married by their mid-20s, with divorce being rare. Although people may have chosen to marry to please their parents or society, it was still an institution that was largely left over from the Middle Ages.
5318	My grandparents were mostly born in the late 1920s to the end of the 1930s, and according to what I have heard, marriage was expected of them at a younger age, due to societal pressure. Divorce was rare at this time, so if a couple changed and one or both people felt that way, they were more or less stuck with it. People were married off by their mid-20s, which was seen as late. People of this time period mainly got married to please their parents and society, with marriage being a social institution that had stayed in place from the Middle Ages. I believe that people are not emotionally or mentally prepared to make a lifelong decision at that age.
5319	All of my grandparents were born somewhere from the late 1920's to the end of the 1930's, and according to most of what I've heard, marriage was typically expected at a younger age than today, as society expected people to marry younger and have loads of children. Divorce was rare at this time, so if couples changed, it was difficult to get out of the marriage. It was seen as an institution that had remained largely the same for generations.
5320	I understand your viewpoint that the money professional sports players are paid could be used to benefit the economy or other areas of the nation, however, I believe that the amount of money sports players are paid is justified. Sports are a business, and teams invest a lot of money in players, both in terms of salary and in terms of the resources and infrastructure necessary to make a team successful. This allows players to make a good living and provides a platform for them to excel and thus creates value for the team and the league.
5321	I personally believe that the amount of money sports players are paid is fair. Salaries for sports players are comparable to those of other professions with similar levels of experience and skill. It is important to remember that these athletes bring in revenue for their teams and clubs which in turn contributes to the economy. Furthermore, sports players have access to certain benefits and financial security that allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and not have to worry about their bills.
5322	I think the salaries that professional sports players receive are commensurate with their level of skill, ability, and contributions to their teams. Players spend years perfecting their craft and dedicate long hours in training, which culminate in a higher level of performance that results in larger paychecks. This system of compensation helps to ensure that players are incentivized to keep their skills sharp, which benefits both the players and their teams.
5323	I understand that sports players are able to attract large crowds and generate revenue for the teams and leagues, but there are other ways the money could be used to benefit the economy or other critical areas of our nation that could potentially have a larger impact. If the money was recycled in this way, it could have a greater benefit on our nation as a whole.
5324	I understand that the amount of money sports players are paid can seem excessive, and that the money could be better used elsewhere. However, sports teams provide jobs and economic growth for the cities in which they are located, which can benefit the economy in the long run. Additionally, many sports players invest a portion of their earnings back into their teams and communities, which can help the area overall.
5325	I believe companies that use cartoon or clown characters to market products to children can be unethical, as it creates an early link in the minds of developing children that these products are fun and safe. The link is then permanently established when the person reaches adulthood, which may lead them to continue consuming these products out of nostalgia. This practice could have potential flaws that need to be further explored.
5326	I believe that companies that use cartoon or clown characters in their marketing to children can be unethical, as it has the potential to establish a permanent link in the minds of young consumers. While there may be some truth to this, it is possible that these products are consumed out of a sense of nostalgia in adulthood. I am open to the idea that there may be flaws in my logic. I invite comments that could change my view.
5327	I believe that companies that use cartoon or clown characters to market products to children can be ethically questionable, as it creates a lasting association in the minds of children that these products are fun and safe. However, I am open to the idea that there may be flaws in my logic.
5328	I believe that companies that use cartoon or clown characters in their marketing to children can be considered unethical, as these images become firmly established in young minds during childhood, leading to continued consumption of these products. While I acknowledge that there may be flaws in this logic, I am open to other perspectives.
5329	I believe that companies that use cartoon or clown characters in their marketing to children can be potentially damaging to impressionable minds. This can lead to the formation of permanent links between the products and the consumers, who may still choose to consume them out of a sense of nostalgia. It is possible that there are flaws in my logic here, and I welcome alternative views.
5330	I'm an Australian and a huge sports fan. I love watching any sport, including the Winter Olympics. However, I find that both Baseball and American Football games have a slow pace and lack of fluidity that I find hard to follow. I feel like there must be more to these sports that I'm missing, and that if I was made aware of this, I would enjoy them more. Are these sports really that exciting? Is it just the American culture's ingrained popularity that makes the games appealing? Please change my view.
5331	I'm an Australian, and I am a big sports fan. I enjoy watching any sport, including the Winter Olympics. However, I have found that there is a lack of fluidity and action in both sports, which has led me to be uninterested in them. I believe there is something I am missing, and that if I was made aware of it, I would appreciate them more. Are these sports really that exciting? Is it possible that the appeal of the game is subconsciously ingrained in the American culture? Please change my view as I would love to be more involved. They are spoken about regularly in Australia.
5332	I'm an Australian and a massive sport lover. I enjoy watching any sport, even the Winter Olympics. However, I have found that there is a lack of fluency and action in both American football and baseball, which makes it difficult for me to appreciate the games. I believe that if I was made aware of certain aspects of these sports, I would then enjoy them more. Are these sports really that exciting? Is it possible that their popularity in American culture has overshadowed the actual game’s appeal? Please let me know your thoughts, as I would love to get more involved in them.  They are spoken about frequently in Australia.
5333	I'm an Australian sports lover who enjoys watching all sports, including the Winter Olympics. While I have tried to sit through full games of both Baseball and American Football, I find there is a lack of fluency and action in both sports, which has left me not appreciating them as much as I could.  I believe that these sports are popular in America because of their cultural significance, rather than their actual appeal to me.  Please help me understand more about these sports and their appeal, as I would love to become a fan.
5334	I'm an Australian and a big sport fan. I love watching any sport, including the Winter Olympics. However, I cannot understand the massive following for Baseball and American Football. I have tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a lack of fluidity and action in both sports. I feel like there are aspects about them that I am missing or not appreciating, and I would enjoy them more if I was made aware of these. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much that the appeal of the actual game is an afterthought? Please change my view.
5335	I never tip, I think it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a substandard wage to employees based on their chosen occupation. I believe tipping should be abolished and in its place, employers should be legally obliged to pay a realistic and survivable wage. If customers choose to tip, it should go directly to the server.
5336	I never tip, I think it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a substandard wage to employees based on their chosen profession. I believe tipping should be abolished and in its place, employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage directly to the server.
5337	I believe that tipping should be eliminated, as it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying sub-minimum wages to servers based on their profession. Ultimately, wages should be set by the government, to ensure a livable wage for the employees.
5338	I believe that tipping should be eliminated, and instead, employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage. I think that customers should be able to choose whether to tip or not, with the money going directly to the server.
5339	I believe that tipping should be optional, rather than mandatory, as I think it should be the customers’ choice whether or not to tip. I also think employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage, rather than relying on tips.
5340	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They are at the forefront of technology, trade and commerce, and provide a range of entertainment options. This area has experienced some tough economic times, but there is potential for growth. Tourism can be an economic driver, but it should not be the only one.
5341	Florida's major metropolitan areas have seen considerable growth in technology, trade, and commerce, as well as entertainment. Although the area has seen growth, it has been hit hard by the economy, and many young people are leaving due to a lack of opportunities. Tourism can be an important economic driver, but it should not be the only option.
5342	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the forefront of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment.   I've been in this region my entire life, and even though we took a battering economy wise, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area; the lack of access to natural amenities and a lack of opportunities for young people is a concern. Tourism is an economic driver, but it should not be the only one.
5343	Florida's major metropolitan areas have been able to retain their significance in technology, trade and commerce, as well as entertainment, even during a difficult economic period. This shows the strength of these areas as hubs for economic activity. While tourism can be an important economic driver, it should not be the only one.  I hope that further developments can be made in these areas to create a more inviting environment in the future.
5344	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. Many of the cities have seen considerable growth and development, providing opportunities for people of all ages. This region is certainly an attractive option for those looking to settle down or relocate. Tourism can be a major economic driver, but it should not be the only one.
5345	There has been increased attention in recent years towards the potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including the possibility of a ‘doomsday’ scenario. Several communities, such as Less Wrong and MIRI, have emerged to discuss these issues, as well as books such as ‘Our Final Invention’ that explore the idea in greater detail.  While AI systems that could threaten human existence are still largely hypothetical, it is possible that they could arise from current trends in AI research, particularly the focus on creating ‘universal optimizers’ that could attempt to optimize for any objective.
5346	There is a growing awareness of the potential risks posed by AI, particularly in the form of general AI, which is seen as having the potential to dramatically alter or even end human civilization. This has led to a number of initiatives, such as those mentioned, which seek to develop strategies to mitigate this risk. While this is a valid concern, I believe the current fear is perhaps overblown.
5347	Many communities and books have sprung up in recent years to address the potential risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI). The safety of AI systems is an important issue, and the possibility of AI systems taking control of everything and optimizing for objectives that could be damaging is a concern. However, I believe the focus of AI research is on imitating the human brain’s memory system and building powerful classifiers, rather than on universal optimizers.
5348	Many communities and books have recently sprung up to address the potential risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there is concern about the possibility of AI taking over the world, I believe the focus of AI research is currently on emulating the cortex’s memory system and building powerful classifiers. It is important to consider the potential risks of AI, but I believe the current fear is overblown.
5349	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday situation. While some research does focus on creating powerful classifiers, there is a larger emphasis on mitigating potential risks posed by advanced AI. AI safety is becoming an increasingly important topic of research as its potential impact on society is better understood.
5350	In recent years, police departments in America have become more aggressive in the use of their powers. Daily we hear of police shootings of unarmed citizens, as well as the killing of animals. There is a worry that this abuse of power is occurring, especially as departments have resisted implementing body-worn cameras, which have been proven to reduce incidents and limit false claims. This suggests a desire to hide criminal activity and systemic abuse. If I were to smoke marijuana, I would be much more at risk from police than from other dangers. This risk is increasing due to the increasing militarization of police forces.
5351	In recent years, police powers in the United States have become increasingly aggressive, leading to daily reports of police shootings of unarmed and non-threatening citizens, as well as animals. Most times, these officers are let off with only a slap on the wrist or paid leave. There is a clear risk of systemic abuse, with the potential for such abuse to increase. While the use of personal cameras has been proven to lower incidents and reduce false claims, police departments have resisted implementation, leading me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activities. The increasingly militarized nature of the threat means that smoking marijuana puts individuals at a greater risk.
5352	In recent years, police officers in America have become more aggressive in the use of their powers, often leading to the death or injury of unarmed citizens, as well as animals. This has raised concerns that such abuses are occurring, despite the vital role that police play in our society. In some areas, cameras have been introduced to curb such abuses, although police departments have been reluctant to implement them. This suggests that they may be attempting to hide wrongdoing. With marijuana use, I am more at risk from police than from any other threat. Furthermore, the increasing militarization of law enforcement only increases this risk.
5353	In recent years, police forces in America have become more aggressive in their use of power. There have been daily reports of police shootings of unarmed citizens, as well as incidents involving animals. While police do play an important role in society, there is a concern that abuse of this trust is occurring. Camera implementation has been proven to reduce incidents and false claims, yet police departments have resisted it. This leads to the inference that they are attempting to hide potential criminal activity and systemic abuse. If I smoke marijuana, I am more vulnerable to danger from the police than from any other source. Moreover, the militarization of these forces has increased this threat.
5354	Over the last decade, the police in America have become more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Daily, we hear of police shootings of unarmed and non-threatening citizens, as well as animals. While these incidents are necessary to maintain order in society, it is clear that abuse of power occurs. In many areas, police departments have resisted the implementation of body-worn cameras, which have been proven to reduce incidents and misuse of power. This suggests that police departments are attempting to cover up criminal activities. The use of marijuana increases this risk, as the potential for danger from police is increasing.
5355	Sure, some brand-specific styling choices could be understood over time, but in nearly 40 years, we have generally established what a general-purpose video game controller should be. This includes a directional pad on the left side, with two sticks and buttons on the right, as well as two bumpers and triggers.   However, there are differences in the placement of these elements between the Microsoft and Sony controllers, which could potentially impact how users interact with the games. While I believe there is a superior layout, it is a matter of personal preference which one I think it is.
5356	Sony and Microsoft have different layouts for the directional pad and left stick, which can make them feel slightly different to use. While these layouts could be reversed, one company has decided to keep its current design due to stubborness.
5357	In 40 years of gaming, we have generally settled on a layout that works for general purpose controllers. This layout includes two thumbsticks, an 8-way directional pad on the left, and two bumper buttons on the right, with the two triggers being separate from the directional pad. While this layout is functionalally similar across all brands, Sony and Microsoft have different placements of the directional pad and left stick due to brand preference and stubbornness on the part of one company.
5358	Sure, some brand styling choices could be understood, but after 40 years, we have largely agreed on what a general purpose video game controller should be.  The controllers share the same function, apart from the directional pad and left stick which are placed differently depending on the company.  I believe one of the companies is simply sticking to its design, due to stubbornness.
5359	Sony and Microsoft have different layouts for the directional pad and left stick, despite them being functionally identical in every other way, likely due to each company's preference. Although the layouts may differ, the overall functionality remains the same.
5360	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo, challenging accepted definitions of art in a revolutionary way. While this has inspired many contemporary installation artists to follow suit, the results are often highly invasive, asking the same questions in different ways, often leading to boredom and apathy among viewers. While museums are increasingly emphasizing the importance of installation art, it can be difficult to connect with as it is often seen as simply a reiteration of the same questions.
5361	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo, challenging traditional conceptions of art. Although installation art has built on this idea since then, it has often been an iterative process of asking the same question; artists have used objects such as tents, beds and sheds in galleries to prompt discussion of what art is. While this has allowed contemporary artists to explore new directions, this has often resulted in works that are dull and boring. This has been particularly true in museums, where such works have been given prominence, despite being uninteresting to many viewers.
5362	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo, demonstrating that art could exist outside of traditional gallery settings. Although this challenged existing ideas of art, installation art since then has explored similar concepts, giving the viewer a sense of déjà vu. This can be restrictive, as it fails to stimulate new ideas and encourage experimentation. Such repetition leads to a lack of excitement and interest in the art.
5363	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo, which marked a shift in the accepted definition of art. Although installation art has since become increasingly popular, many of these works fail to captivate viewers in the same way that Fountain succeeded in doing. This could be due to the lack of creativity or innovation within these works; the same topics and questions are rarely addressed. However, installation art has the potential to be just as successful and thought-provoking as Fountain if done correctly.
5364	Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo, and helped to usher in a new era of art by challenging traditional definitions of art. This movement has since been referred to as installation art, which is often an attempt to question what is art. While some installation art has been successful in this pursuit, it has largely been an exercise in repetition, with artists merely repeating the same ideas over and over. The result is that such art is largely unexciting and boring, which could lead to a lack of interest in the art form amongst the general public.
5365	The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference, followed by goals scored, then the head-to-head results between teams. This is the correct order; goal difference/goals scored should be given more weight than head-to-head results, as it measures a team's performance over the course of the tournament more accurately than goals scored, which can be decided randomly in certain cases.
5366	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.  That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. I believe goal difference should be given more weight than goals scored, and head-to-head results should be taken into account after goals scored in order to properly evaluate teams.
5367	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.   That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. I believe goals scored should be given more weight than goal difference, and this makes sense to me since goals have a direct bearing on the result of the match. Thus, I believe goals scored should be given more weight in the tiebreakers.
5368	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.   That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. I believe goals scored should be the final factor determining group placings. It is more reflective of team strength.
5369	Team A's results throughout the tournament should be the primary factor in determining the Group's winner. However, in order to make a comparison between teams, the criteria used is the goal difference, then the goals scored, and only then the head-to-head results between teams. I believe that the order of the latter two should be reversed, with goals scored being the primary factor, followed by goal difference, and then head-to-head results between teams.
5370	China has a large population that needs jobs to support their families and make ends meet; however, the government cannot always actively fight poverty on its own. Without jobs, families could face poverty and not be able to afford food, rent, or clothes. If outsourcing was removed, prices would increase globally, impacting people who are on the brink of poverty. Workers who lose their jobs to robots would face the same issue as those in China. I recognize that paying workers pennies is not ideal, but it is the best way to maintain the current balance.
5371	My understanding is that while it may be necessary to outsource some projects to China in order to provide economic relief to its citizens, the removal of outsourcing could cause prices to rise globally, affecting people living on the brink of poverty. Additionally, workers’ wages would again be affected if their jobs were taken over by robots, as is the case in China. Ultimately, in order to improve conditions first and make changes where possible, governments must actively work to alleviate poverty.
5372	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China can be a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China—and this could potentially lead to further economic issues. Therefore, maintaining the current balance is key in order to improve conditions.
5373	In China, workers have the potential to earn money to support their families, though this income may be very low. My understanding is that unless a governing body takes active steps to alleviate poverty, outsourcing of American projects to China is necessary in order to keep households afloat. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they risk not being able to afford basic needs such as food, rent and clothing. Additionally, if outsourcing were to be removed, prices would increase globally, further impacting those living on the margins. Workers who keep their jobs would face the same predicament. In order to improve the situation first, changes need to be made gradually.
5374	Workers in China, even if they are paid a nominal fee, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body takes active steps to alleviate poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can just get by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they could once again not be able to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing were removed, prices worldwide would skyrocket, affecting people currently living at the economic margin. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would once again face the same predicament as those in China, so while I do not agree with paying children or other adults a nominal fee for hard labor, I think it is the best way to maintain the fragile equilibrium we have. Improve first, then alter what can be altered.
5375	* Everyone should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. People should be able to access government-approved drugs safely, with guidance on their effects and potential risks. People should be able to make their own decisions on whether or not to take drugs.  Increasing access to education on drugs is key to making informed choices.
5376	* Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges and access pure drugs with knowledge of what they're taking. Access to information on drugs and providing education on their effects could be beneficial in increasing peoples understanding of them.
5377	* Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges.  * Everybody should be able to buy government-approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking.  In some countries, laws are now much more lenient and medicinal marijuana can be bought at dispensaries and head shops, providing an additional layer of safety.
5378	* Nobody should take a drug they do not understand the effects of, and education is the key to changing people's attitudes towards drugs. It is important to remember that drugs can be potentially harmful and should be approached with caution.   * Government approved drugs should be available for purchase and it should be ensured that the quality and purity of drugs is regulated. It is important for people to be aware of the risks of taking drugs and be cautious when doing so.   * People should have access to help if they are addicted to drugs and laws need to be put in place to protect them from harm. It is important to ensure that people have the information and knowledge about the effects and risks of drugs before taking them.
5379	* Everyone should be able to access safe and legal sources of psychedelics, stimulants and depressants, as well as other drugs, for legitimate medicinal and recreational purposes. Everyone should be able to easily access pure and government-approved drugs with information on effects and dosage.
5380	It is important to consider the long-term implications of government policies, as India is renowned for its religious tolerance. Although Gujarat has seen positive economic development under Narendra Modi’s leadership, this could change if implemented on a larger scale. Additionally, while Congress has been corrupt, this has not been the case with Modi. This suggests that effective leadership may be preferable to corruption in the long run.
5381	India is known for its centuries-long history of religious tolerance and coexistence among different faiths, which has enabled the country to maintain a diverse cultural landscape. Although the current government of Narendra Modi may improve economic conditions in Gujarat, the risk is that it will lead to the destruction of this religious tolerance. It is better to maintain the existing Congress system, which has its flaws but is not as corrupt as Modi's government.
5382	India is a diverse country that needs strong leadership in order to ensure stability and growth. While Narendra Modi's economic record in Gujarat is commendable, it is important to consider the effect that this could have on religious tolerance in India, which has always been a defining feature of the country. It is better to maintain congress, who while corrupt, are more tolerant of different faiths than an effective, intolerant leadership.
5383	In general, it is better to have a more tolerant society where religious freedom is respected than to have a less tolerant one, particularly when it comes to preserving religious freedoms. This is especially true in India, where religious tolerance is part of its culture and identity. Additionally, it is better to have a government that is effective in protecting its citizens and preventing such atrocities than one that is corrupt. Although India has its problems with corruption, having a more effective government is better in the long run.
5384	In terms of the Indian election, although Narendra Modi's policies in Gujarat may have had positive economic results, this comes at the cost of religious tolerance, which is one of India's main features. It is better to keep Congress in power, who while being corrupt are not responsible for the 2002 Gujarat riots in which Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity.
5385	I believe that experiencing war on one’s own soil could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It is easy to become complacent when it is not our own children who are suffering the consequences of war; it is difficult to comprehend the motives of others without walking in their shoes. As for Cindy Sheehan and her motives, it is impossible to judge without being in her shoes.
5386	I believe that being present at a war on US soil could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It is easy to become complacent when it is not your own children who are suffering the consequences of violence - the destruction of towns, the loss of limb, or even worse, death. Cindy Sheehan's grief is understandable, and while we may not be able to relate to her experience, it is wrong to question her motives.
5387	I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media does not always show the full horrors of war, such as the experiences of refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, and the mental anguish that cannot be properly conveyed in media form. It is easier to become desensitized when it is not your own loved ones suffering in such a way.
5388	I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media does not always show the full extent of war; issues such as refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, and the physical and psychological trauma of war are often difficult to capture in a visual medium. It is easy to become complacent when it is not our own children who are suffering these horrific fates.   I think Cindy Sheehan's actions are admirable, and I understand her motives; only she knows what it is like to lose a loved one and I cannot judge her grief.
5389	I believe that being exposed to the realities of war can be a powerful and necessary experience for Americans, in order to make an informed decision about potential military action. It is easier to become desensitized to violence when it is not happening on our own land, and it is understandable why this can be difficult to comprehend.
5390	I believe marijuana should be legalized to provide individuals with a second chance, reduce prison costs for the government and generate revenue through taxes. Federal and state governments should be able to regulate marijuana and set limits on use, such as forbidding its use while driving. The same regulations should be imposed on marijuana as for other goods and services to guarantee revenue. There is evidence that prohibiting drugs does more harm than good as it increases their value and profit for dealers on the black market.
5391	I believe marijuana should be decriminalized, as it could bring numerous benefits. People who were arrested for using marijuana would still have a chance to re-enter the workforce, and the taxpayers would pay less to maintain the prison system. Additionally, legalization of marijuana would generate revenue for state and federal governments through taxation. This could potentially decrease the demand and supply of marijuana on the black market, while leaving the legal market unchanged. Decriminalization would be beneficial for both users and non-users.
5392	I believe that marijuana should be legalized, as it could offer many benefits.  Firstly, those convicted of using marijuana could get a second chance to re-enter the workforce, leading to savings for the government. Secondly, the taxation of marijuana could provide revenue for federal and state governments. Additionally, decriminalization would reduce the value of the drug on the black market, which in turn could reduce the profits of the drug industry.   In conclusion, while prohibition of marijuana and other drugs may be intended to reduce demand, it does more harm than good.
5393	I believe marijuana should be legalized in certain contexts.  If marijuana were to be legalized, there would be several advantages.  First, people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses would have a second chance to re-enter the job market.  Second, the cost of maintaining prisons could be reduced due to fewer prisoners.  Finally, the government can gain additional revenue through taxation of marijuana, similar to other goods and services.   Additionally, legalization would reduce the supply of marijuana, however the demand would remain roughly the same. This leads to increased profits for drug industries which operate illegally on the black market.   In conclusion, I believe legalization can provide numerous benefits to society that outweigh the current consequences of prohibition.
5394	I would support the legalization of marijuana, as there would be several benefits.  First, those arrested for marijuana use would have a second chance to re-enter the workforce. Second, due to fewer prisoners, taxpayers would pay less to maintain the prison system. Third, legal marijuana would generate revenue for federal and state governments through taxation.   Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces supply and demand, leading to higher prices and profits for the drug industry on the black market. Prohibition of drugs does more harm than good in these cases.
5395	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its much harder to overdose on, and if it were made legal, it would make it easier for governments to regulate. A good example of this is what happened with Prohibition; when it was made illegal, people still consumed it, just as with cannabis, which taxed police resources in terms of investigating more serious crimes. When Prohibition was lifted, social order was restored.
5396	Yes. Legalization would make marijuana more accessible and easier to regulate. This would be beneficial as it would eliminate the need for strict enforcement of laws and provide more resources for crimes that are more pressing. Additionally, the legalization of marijuana would be less disruptive to society compared to Prohibition.
5397	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (similar to what happens with weed). This could have helped reduce larger issues, such as who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was removed, society was able to return to normal.
5398	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it were legal, it would make regulation easier. A good example of this is Prohibition; when it was illegal, people still consumed it (as they do with cannabis) and it cost a lot of police resources to enforce it, but this enabled authorities to resolve more pressing issues like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was lifted, order returned to society as well.
5399	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, easier to regulate, and legalization could help reduce the costs of enforcing laws and solving more serious cases. Legalization has been successful in the past, such as with the repeal of Prohibition, which had a positive impact on society.
5400	This website used to be vibrant with debates and intellectual discussions, however, in recent weeks I have not been able to spend as much time here as I used to due to the lack of quality debates and general participation. This needs to change, and I aim to bring more debates back to the website by having them regularly and covering a range of political, social, and moral issues. I believe this can help bring the website back to its former glory.
5401	In recent times, the number of debates on this website has reduced significantly, which is disappointing. It is vital for debate websites to have a vibrant community in order to generate interesting discussions. As such, I believe there needs to be more focus on encouraging people to participate in debates and increasing the quality and quantity of debates available. This can be done by hosting debates on a regular basis, as well as providing incentives to encourage more people to join in.
5402	I used to visit this website regularly, but it has become increasingly difficult to find quality debates. This is mainly due to the lack of participation and the lack of engagement with the topics discussed. It used to be that I was drawn to this website regularly, but I now need to make an effort to visit it. This needs to change. Therefore, I will be having at least five debates per week on a variety of political, social, and moral issues that I feel are important and not discussed enough to bring the website back to its former glory.
5403	It is disappointing that there are fewer quality debates and overall participation on the website, as it has decreased the stimulation I get from it. I believe that with more debates and greater discussion, this website can return to its former glory. Therefore, I plan to have at least five debates a week on topics ranging from politics, social, and moral issues in order to bring about this change.
5404	There has been a decline in quality debates and participation on this website, which is disappointing. It used to be that I was drawn to this site frequently, but now I have to make an effort to spend a few minutes a week logged in. This needs to change, so I will make an effort to have at least 5 debates a week, covering a range of political, social, and moral issues. This can help to bring the website back to life.
5405	It is up to the government to decide whether kids should be allowed to eat candy or not. While it is legal for kids to consume candy, advertisements can influence children to choose certain brands, which is a concern for parents. We need to have a system in place to ensure that children are protected, rather than leaving it up to the parents alone. Therefore, government intervention should be considered.
5406	This debate is not about whether kids should be allowed to eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads that portray candy-eating as desirable. In some cases, this can lead to kids starting to eat candy, which could be harmful. However, kids naturally prefer sweets, so parents should be responsible for teaching them the importance of a balanced diet. We should let parents make these decisions, rather than relying on the government to do so.
5407	Governments should not intervene in the marketing of products to children by banning ads which depict candy-eating, as it is legal for kids to consume candy. Parents should take responsibility for their children and teach them about healthy eating habits. Additionally, the ads only influence kids to choose one brand over another, rather than introducing them to candy-eating. Thus, it is important to ensure children have the freedom to choose what they want to eat.
5408	It is legal for kids to consume candy in some cases, so why should governments prevent people from influencing kids' food choices? While parents should take responsibility for their children, governments can overstep their bounds by attempting to regulate these choices. We must recognize the need for parental authority and personal freedom.
5409	Governments should not ban ads for kids that depict candy-eating, as it is legal for kids to eat candy. Parents should take responsibility for their children, rather than relying on the government to babysit. Allowing kids to make their own food choices is important for their development and allows them to express their own preferences.
5410	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world responded with outcry, a response similar to what has occurred in the past few decades when one country invades another. Though these instances have generated international criticism, Germany's invasion of Poland in 1932 was an exception, as the international community more strongly condemned the action.
5411	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932, and the international community reacted with outrage. There have been many cases in the past 100 years where countries have invaded other nations, and the world has condemned these actions. However, when Germany invaded Poland, the international community rose up against it. Although there have been cases where leaders have gotten away with invading other countries, those leaders were tried for war crimes and faced punishments such as imprisonment or execution.
5412	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world responded with outrage, resulting in increased diplomatic pressure against Germany. Similarly, there are numerous examples in the last century where countries have invaded other nations and faced international opprobrium. However, the case of Germany is unique in that the world largely condemned it.
5413	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world responded with outcry and condemnation. Similarly, there have been numerous cases in the past century where countries have invaded other nations, leading to global outrage. However, the cases involving Germany have been singled out for criticism, even though other countries have also committed war crimes.
5414	Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and the world responded with outrage. There are numerous examples in the last century of countries invading each other, which resulted in international outcry. Despite this, Germany was able to get away with it. Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of the UK, also authorized the invasion of Iraq, which is considered a war crime. Both of them should be tried for their crimes.
5415	Truth is ultimately relative to the individual experience and context of the person; what one person may view as true, another person may interpret differently. This highlights the importance of understanding that truth is subjective and can differ depending on the situation.
5416	Truth is relative to each individual’s experience and perspective. I believe that our experiences and perceptions of the world shape our own versions of truth. For instance, although the direction of water flow when flushing a toilet may differ depending on the situation, both our truths can co-exist.
5417	Truth is subjective and can vary according to individual experiences and perspectives. However, I believe that our experiences can shape our understanding of what is true for us. For example, when I flush a toilet, I believe that the water flows in a clockwise direction, whereas in Brazil, it goes counterclockwise. Though this may be the case, our beliefs are still defined by our individual scenarios.
5418	Well, truth is subjective in some senses, as what one person believes to be true may differ from another person's belief. For example, some people believe that water goes down the drain in a certain direction, while others believe the opposite. Ultimately, what determines truth is the situation and context of each scenario.
5419	In some cases, what is true for one person may differ from what is true for another; our experiences and perspectives can shape what we believe to be true. Although we may have different beliefs, both versions of the truth exist.
5420	In the NFL, not every position is paid the same. Kickers are not paid as much as running backs, and running backs are not paid as much as quarterbacks. Quarterbacks are paid more since the success of the team depends more on their decisions. However, this is not the case for successful teams; rather, a team's success is usually dependent on the quarterback's ability. Thus, their salaries should be higher, as teams' success is more dependent on the quarterback's ability than any other position on the team.
5421	In the NFL, there is no denying that quarterbacks are paid more than other positions, as their success is crucial for the success of the team. Quarterbacks have a larger role in a team's success than any other position, as their decisions are what determines victory more often than not. Therefore, teams tend to invest more in quarterbacks to ensure success.
5422	In the NFL, not every position is paid equally. Quarterbacks are paid more, as the success of a team is more dependent on the quarterback's decisions than any other position. Teams are more successful due to the quarterback's abilities than any other position on the team. Therefore, quarterbacks should be pampered more than other positions.
5423	In the NFL, not every position is paid equally. Quarterbacks are paid more because the success of the team is more dependent on the decisions they make. While this is true for many teams, it is not always the case that a team's success depends solely on the quarterback's performance. It is understandable that teams need quarterbacks to succeed in order to have success, thus meaning they should be compensated more than other positions on the team.
5424	In the NFL, not every position is paid equally. Quarterbacks are paid more since teams' success is largely dependent on their decisions, as opposed to other positions. This is because quarterbacks are a crucial part of a team's success. It is more important for a team to have a successful quarterback than any other position. Therefore, they should be pampered due to this factor.
5425	I think his briefing today was more in-depth than before, suggesting that he now better understands the gravity of the situation. However, I am concerned that he is assigning too much blame to the previous administrations, when both parties have been complicit in the cozy relationship between politics and oil companies which has existed for decades.
5426	I was more reassured by his briefing today. He acknowledges that he is being compared to Bush's Katrina response, as well as understanding the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with. Previously, I didn't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. Although he has accepted donations from BP, I believe he is taking the right approach in directing attention to the corruption between politics and oil companies, which has been an issue for a long time.
5427	I think his briefing today gave a more clear understanding of his views on the connection between the oil spill and other environmental disasters. He now realizes that these issues are interconnected and need to be addressed, whereas before he did not take these concerns as seriously. I also agree that he is right to point out the corruption between politics and oil companies, which has been a problem for a long time.
5428	I think he is now taking the issues with the oil spill more seriously than before. While he is correct in that the direct connections between politics and the oil companies are a long-standing issue, he should acknowledge that these ties have been in place for some time, which makes the issue more complex. He is also right that the problem exists predating President Carter's time in office, but I believe he should be more forthcoming with his criticism of the previous administration, given the magnitude of the disaster.
5429	I think that Biden's briefing today was more comprehensive than before. It is clear that he understands that the comparison to Bush's Katrina in regards to this oil spill has been an issue and that the Sestak issue needs to be addressed, which was not the case before. While he may feel that the corruption between politics and oil companies has been an ongoing issue, he is pointing fingers at the Bush administration for this, which I believe is irresponsible.
5430	Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be: Wrestling is a physical sport wherein two opponents attempt to gain an advantage over or control one another through grappling and holds, without using weapons or causing harm. This differs from what is seen on television, wherein some wrestlers use weapons and cause injury.  In addition, the use of weapons has been seen to increase over time, which is dangerous and unsportsman-like.
5431	Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unharmed persons, where each wrestler strives to gain an advantage over or control over the other.  Are we seeing this on television? Yes, some wrestling matches can be quite violent, with the use of chairs, bats, and other weapons, which can result in injury. However, these instances are rare, and the matches are usually monitored by the producers and referees to ensure the safety of the participants. This gives the audience an enjoyable experience while keeping them safe.
5432	Let me start by defining what wrestling is: Wrestling is the physical contention of two or more individuals, with each wrestler trying to gain an advantage or control over their opponent. Although some wrestling events can be intenjureous, wrestlers are typically unharmed. This definition differs from what is seen on television, as some wrestling events have taken a more violent turn. Such examples include the 'Undertaker' wrapping a rope around his opponent's neck, which could have caused serious injury.
5433	Wrestling is a physical competition between two opponents, in which each participant attempts to gain an advantage or control over their opponent without causing harm. While some wrestling elements can involve the use of weapons, such as chairs and bats, this does not necessarily mean that the participants are harmed. It is thus possible for wrestling to be intense and intense without causing harm to the participants.
5434	Wrestling is a physical sport where two opponents attempt to gain an advantage or control over one another. On television, this is often done through grappling and holds, which can lead to injuries. While this can be dramatic at times, it is not as dangerous as using weapons, as has been seen in some matches. Thus, it is clear that the definition of wrestling states that the wrestlers must remain unharmed.
5435	We all know that guys can sometimes feel the need to have sex to satisfy their curiosity or to make themselves feel more attractive. However, this can put pressure on their partner and make them feel uncomfortable, which could lead to them breaking up with the partner and finding someone else who is more willing. This can be selfish and unsatisfactory for both parties.
5436	We all know that guys will often feel pressure to have sex from their partner even if they are not ready. This can make the girl feel uncomfortable, especially if the guy is not ready. It is understandable that the guy may want to have sex to feel satisfied, but this is not a suitable way to do so.
5437	We all know that guys may feel pressure to have sex when they are not ready, leading them to break up with their partner and move on to someone else, which can make the girl feel unsure of herself and less confident. This can be an issue of self-satisfaction on the guy's part.
5438	We all know that guys often feel pressure to have sex to impress their friends and satisfy themselves, even if the girl is not ready. If the guy wants it bad, he may break up with the girl and go out with someone else. This makes the girl feel insecure and lowers his self-esteem.
5439	We all know that guys may feel pressure to have sex when they are not ready, or if the guy is interested in it, he will break up with the girl and go out with someone else. This can make girls feel insecure and unsure of themselves, as well as the guy being a low selfish asshole. Though guys may feel satisfied from having sex, it does not necessarily build a strong relationship between the two.
5440	We should ensure that education is accessible to all, as it is essential to the functioning of society. If people are unable to afford the cost of education, there are consequences that could occur, such as restricted opportunities for the future. Education gives people the power to strive for success. It is justified that access to education should not be denied based on an individual's financial situation.
5441	We should ensure that everyone has access to education, as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the cost of education, there may be consequences, such as restricting individuals' potential for success. Education provides people with the power to achieve their goals and reach success. Although governments have the right to regulate education financing, no one should be denied education simply due to cost.
5442	We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education, this can have consequences, such as a limiting of people's potential. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and success, and provides them with the opportunity to achieve success. It is important to ensure that everyone has access to education, as this gives people the power to achieve their goals and attain success.
5443	We must ensure that education is accessible to all, as it is essential for our society to function properly. Without access to education, many people's future prospects would be jeopardized. Education gives people the power to achieve their goals and success. No one should be denied education simply because their family is unable to pay for it.
5444	Education is essential to society functioning, and it is crucial to have access to education in order to achieve success and have a brighter future. In some cases, people may not be able to afford the costs of education, which can have a negative impact on their future opportunities. It is therefore important that education is made accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial background.
5445	The Torah will remain in effect until heaven and earth pass away; Jesus was not saying that all the prophetic events in the Scriptures must happen before the Law is fulfilled. The Law will be fulfilled in its entirety.
5446	The Scriptures teach us that until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot or tittle of the law will fail to be fulfilled (Matthew 5:18). This indicates that all prophetic events must occur at some point in the future, as heaven and earth still exist. I agree with Yahushua that the law will be fulfilled in its entirety.
5447	The Torah will last forever as God promised that it would in Psalms 119:89. However, some of the prophetic events in the Scriptures have not yet taken place, meaning that Heaven and Earth are still in existence and the Law has not changed. This indicates that not all of the Law's prophetic events have been fulfilled yet.
5448	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." This passage suggests that the law, including the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures, will be fulfilled at some point in the future. I believe that heaven and earth will pass away at some point in the future, but until then, some of the law will remain in effect.
5449	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." The Scriptures indicate that heaven and earth will indeed pass away, but the law will remain until all the prophetic events have taken place. I believe that Jesus is emphasizing the eternal nature of the law, as he is no liar.
5450	China has kept its currency relatively low to enable the sale of cheap goods to the US. If the dollar falls low enough, Chinese goods will become more expensive, hurting American consumers in the short term. However, this could strengthen the domestic market for US producers in the long run.
5451	China has kept its currency low to continue providing cheap goods to the US, which has hurt American consumer in the short term. However, this can strengthen the domestic market for US producers in the long run.
5452	China has kept its currency low in order to continue providing cheap goods to the US. If the dollar were to decrease in value in comparison, Chinese goods would become more expensive, hurting American consumers in the short term. However, this could help the domestic market for US producers in the long run.
5453	China has kept its currency low in order to continue providing cheap goods to the US. If the US dollar drops in relation to the Chinese currency, this will make Chinese goods more expensive for US consumers in the short term. In the long term, this could strengthen the US domestic market as US producers are able to compete more effectively.
5454	China has kept its currency low to allow for cheaper goods to be provided to the US. If the dollar were to decrease in relation to the yuan, this would cause Chinese goods to become more expensive, hurting American consumers in the short term. However, this could benefit the US domestic market in the long run.
5455	I visited this restaurant during my last trip to Montreal over the summer. It seemed to be popular with the locals, as it was quite busy on the night I went. We were able to get a table and ordered.   The pricing can be a bit tricky, as you pay for what you order, but individual items are listed. On this night, there were some errors in our orders, with things going to other tables and vice versa. The sushi was good, but overall I felt that we were charged more than what we got and ordered.
5456	I went here for dinner on my last night in Montreal over the summer. It was quite popular and busy that evening. We were able to get a table and started to order.

5460	We were pleasantly surprised by the new space - it's even better than the last one! The food is excellent - we had the rib and brisket tacos, which were outstanding.

5465	We enjoyed our experience at Zeta's. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly. We will definitely be returning as we had a positive experience. We had lunch there and I had the meat shawarma pita, which was great. My husband had the gyro, which was also delicious. They serve freshly made pita bread and olive oil at the beginning, which was excellent. We were in and out in about 30 minutes.

We had lunch there and I had the meat shawarma pita while my husband had the gyro. Both were great and the pita bread was homemade. We were done in about 30 minutes.
5470	I was impressed with the food, drinks, and patio, as well as the Caesar being one of the best I've ever had. The nachos and fish tacos had full flavor and a authentic taste. Service was a bit slow, but I understand that the restaurant may have been rough at first, which could have led to poor reviews. I believe it is worth giving a chance.
5471	I was pleasantly surprised by the food, drinks, and patio at this restaurant. I found the service to be adequate, and I was not necessarily looking to be turned over quickly. The nachos were tasty, and my fish tacos were full of flavor and authentic. The Caesar is one of the best I've ever had. I think this place has the potential to be excellent if they improve the initial customer experience a bit.
5472	I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was pleasant, and the menu had a good selection of options. The prices were reasonable, and I found the portion sizes to be generous. The service was a bit slower than I would have liked, but overall I was pleased with my experience.

Overall, I think the restaurant has potential and it is worth giving a try.
5473	I'm not quite sure why this place has had a lower rating. I was pleasantly surprised by the food, drinks, and patio; the service was a bit slower than usual, but I prefer to be able to take my time and savor the meal rather than feeling rushed. The nachos were delicious and the fish tacos were full of flavor and had a true authentic taste. The Caesar was one of the best I've ever had.   I think the restaurant may have had a few teething problems when it first opened, which could have contributed to the lower reviews; however, I believe the menu has great options and the atmosphere is perfect for a summer evening out.
5474	I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the drinks and the patio were pleasant, and I found the service to be satisfactory. The nachos were flavorful and the fish tacos were full of flavor and authentic in taste. The Caesar is one of the best I've ever had. I think the restaurant has potential and it deserves another chance from customers.
5475	Given that there were four of us who became ill after consuming the food, we will be extra cautious and choose an option that has fewer risks. If there is a choice of zero stars, we will choose that option.
5476	If there is no star option available, I would choose that one.   We went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of six. We ordered hummus as an appetizer, potato pizza, LOBSTER GNOCCHI, ROASTED CHICKEN and hamburgers as main dishes. Three of us experienced diarrhea during the night, with one person suffering from acid reflux and gas, while the other two had gas issues. We did not enjoy the food that evening and would not go back again.
5477	After dining there on October 20th at 6 pm, we ordered hummus as an appetizer, along with potato pizza, lobster gnocchi, roasted chicken, and hamburgers. Unfortunately, three of us ended up with diarrhea, while one had acid reflux and lots of gas. We also experienced gas issues for the two of us. We are concerned that the food may have been the cause of these reactions, so we will not be returning in the future.
5478	We went to the restaurant at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of 6. We ordered hummus as an appetizer, as well as potato pizza, LOBSTER GNOCCHI, ROASTED CHICKEN and hamburgers. 3 of us experienced diarrhea during the night, while one of us had acid reflux and another had gas problems. We will be avoiding the restaurant in the future as the food gave us all an unpleasant experience.
5479	Given that zero stars is the lowest rating, I would choose that option if there are no other options available. While I understand the potential risks of eating at an establishment, I would be more inclined to try it if I had an upset stomach in the past as I would rather know what I am dealing with and make an informed decision.
5480	There are not many wine bars in Mesa, but D'Vine has always been a pleasant refuge when wanting to stay in town. The food has always been tasty and the staff have been friendly each time we have visited. The atmosphere and live music have been pleasant so far. 11pm would be ideal for us night owls.
5481	There are not many wine bars in Mesa, but D’Vine has been a nice refuge for me when wanting to stay in town. The food has always been tasty and the staff friendly each time we have visited. I particularly enjoy the live music and the atmosphere, though I would like it to stay open later on weekends, as 11 PM would be perfect.

5483	D'Vine has been a great option for wine bars in Mesa when I want to stay in town. The food has always been tasty, the staff friendly and the atmosphere pleasant. I appreciate that it is conveniently located around the corner from me and saves me the hassle of driving to Gilbert or Scottsdale.  Additionally, the live music has been great and I like the atmosphere. My only wish is that they stayed open later on the weekends. 11 PM would be perfect.
5484	D'Vine has been a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town. The food has always been tasty and the staff friendly each time we've come in. The atmosphere is nice and the live music has been great so far. My only wish is that they stay open later on the weekends – 11 PM would be perfect.
5485	I am absolutely in love with this place! Every time my husband and I go, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. The food is always delicious—the chicken in particular is always on point, and the beef is equally impressive. The rice, beans, and plantains are all cooked to perfection.  The dessert was a bit of a letdown, as I thought it was a tres leches cake, but it wasn't as sweet as I expected. Overall, it's still delicious!
5486	I absolutely love this place! Every time my husband and I go, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. The food is always amazing - the chicken is always cooked perfectly, and the beef is especially delicious. The rice, beans and plantains are always amazing as well. It never disappoints.  The tres leches cake was good, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting - I'm used to a richer, more sugary American version of it. Nevertheless, it was still very tasty.
5487	I am really fond of this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we find that the food is consistently delicious. We usually tend to forget about it a little bit since it is not as flashy, but the flavor always stands out.  Chicken is wonderful, Beef is great, and the rice, beans and Plantains are amazing. Definitely a must-try! My only disappointment with the dessert was that it was not as sweet as what I am used to.
5488	I am obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints.  Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, plantains? God, stop it.  I thought the tres leches cake was good, although it wasn't as sweet as I expected.
5489	I am absolutely obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we are amazed by the quality of the food. The chicken and beef are always cooked to perfection, and the rice, beans, and plantains are absolutely delicious. It never disappoints! I have only had their tres leches cake once, and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't quite as sweet as I am used to. Still delicious!
5490	If you have lots of time to spare waiting for a burger, then this place is worth considering. 25 minutes to get served is much longer than ideal, but it is still an acceptable option for those seeking a unique experience. I was pleasantly surprised by the meal, and would certainly visit again if the occasion arises.
5491	If you have time to spare, this place might be suitable for you. 25 minutes for a burger is way too long; I feel that I have wasted my time, money and calories. McDonalds offers a similar experience, or even better in some cases, so I have chosen to enjoy a salad. This place's high ratings are remarkable.
5492	If you have lots of time to spare waiting for a burger, this place may be for you. 25 minutes to get it served is definitely longer than necessary, but it may still prove satisfactory for you. I personally chose to go to this restaurant rather than McDonalds, and I still enjoyed my experience. This could potentially be an effective option for those who prefer a slower, more relaxed atmosphere.
5493	If you have time to spare, this place may be suitable for you. 25 minutes to get served a burger is certainly too long. I wasted my time, money and calories, as I could have had a better experience at McDonalds or even better. This experience was not enjoyable for me.
5494	Given the longer wait time of this restaurant compared to other fast food establishments, it may be better to go to places like McDonald's, where service is quicker. This could be disappointing if you are looking to enjoy a meal at a slower pace, but these short waiting times may be beneficial when wanting to get a meal quickly.
5495	I pity those of you on the other side. The load of pop-ups and viruses that IE has are one of the main reasons I love Firefox. The ability to view multiple webpages simultaneously in one tab is incredibly useful and allows for much better navigation of multiple sites at the same time. Additionally, Firefox saves the webpages you were last visiting in case of a restart or something.
5496	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop-up ads and viruses that IE has can make using it a challenge. Although I love Firefox, its tab option is one of the features I appreciate the most. It saves the websites you were last at for future use, which is very convenient.
5497	I prefer Firefox due to its tab option, which makes it much easier to browse multiple websites at the same time. Additionally, Firefox saves the webpages you were last using, which is very convenient in case of a restart or something similar. It simply has a lot of features that make using multiple websites much easier.
5498	I have found that Firefox offers several advantages over other browsers, such as the tab option, which makes it easier to switch between sites. Additionally, Firefox saves the websites you were last at for future use, which is convenient.
5499	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop-ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?!  Main reason I love Firefox is its tab option. The last time I checked, IE requires you to open a whole new browser window to view two websites simultaneously. This is impractical, as far as I am concerned.  Oh, and Firefox saves the websites you were last at in case of a restart or something. It has so many cool features that I cannot list them all.
5500	I believe that Mozilla Firefox is the best browser out of the ones available as I have personally used it myself. The reason why more people use Internet Explorer is because it is the default browser in most cases, which gives it an advantage. I believe that if users were given a choice, more people would opt for Firefox due to its features and performance.
5501	Firefox is a great browser and I use it myself, but it is true that other browsers have greater market share due to their bundling with operating systems. I believe that overall, Firefox has a larger share of the market than IE due to user choice.
5502	Firefox is a popular choice for many web users as it offers a range of advantages. Its user-friendly interface, additional features and customization options make it an attractive option for many. Additionally, due to its relatively high market share, most users are exposed to it first-hand, allowing them to make an informed decision. In contrast, Internet Explorer’s high market share is largely due to its being the default browser in most cases.
5503	Firefox is a great browser, and I personally prefer it due to my experience with it. However, this is largely due to the fact that Firefox is not the default browser for most computers – instead, Internet Explorer is the default in most cases. I believe that if users are given a choice, Firefox would be preferred by a larger percentage of users.
5504	Firefox is a great option, as I have found through experience that it offers a high level of functionality and performance. Its popularity is likely due to the fact that it is often the default browser option with most computers, which means users have a chance to explore other options. I believe that, overall, Firefox is the best choice for users.
5505	If my husband were to commit a murder, I would likely not turn him in. I would support him and be there for him, as I believe that couples should stay together and work through the difficult times together. Although I understand that he would have to pay for his crime, I do not believe that I could be the one to turn him in. We must protect each other and be there for each other, no matter how bad the situation is.

I may not feel comfortable turning him in, as I would not wish to turn the person I love in. We must protect each other and provide our love and support.
5507	I would be supportive of my husband if he committed a murder. I know he made a mistake and needs to pay for it, but I would not feel comfortable turning him in. We need to protect each other and be there for each other no matter the situation.
5508	If my husband committed a murder, I would be supportive of him, as I am married to him and believe that marriage should be a partnership. However, I would not turn him in, as I would not want to betray the person I love. We must protect each other and be there for each other, regardless of the situation.
5509	If my husband committed a murder, I would most likely turn him in. Although he made a mistake, I know I should be there for him and make sure he pays for it. However, I would not have the heart to turn in the person I love, especially since we need to protect each other and be there for each other no matter how bad it is.
5510	I could not turn in my spouse, family, or friends if they committed a murder, as they are too close to me and I could not picture my life without any of them. While I understand the laws and rules of the justice system, I believe that this is wrong and particularly so if you live with the person.
5511	I could not turn in my spouse or family and friends if they committed a murder, as they are too important to me. I could not imagine life without them; that would be wrong.
5512	I could not turn in my spouse or family and friends if they committed a murder, as they are too close to me and I could not envision my life without any of them. While I understand the legal ramifications of such an action, it is still difficult to picture.
5513	I could not turn in my spouse or family and friends if they committed a murder, as they are too close to me and I could not picture my life without any of them. I think that is wrong, especially if you live with the person.
5514	I could not turn in my loved ones if they committed a murder as their punishment would directly impact my life. While I believe in the rule of law, I also believe that prison time should be serve as an opportunity to rehabilitate the individual, allowing them to return to society.
5515	I believe books offer more benefits than electronic media as they engage a reader's imagination, improve reading, grammar and writing skills. PBS Kids, History channel and other educational channels can be a good option as they help people get smarter.
5516	I argue that books are better than television as they can help to improve a person's imagination, reading, grammar, and writing skills. Books require more active engagement from readers, which can improve these skills over time. Additionally, books provide more intellectual stimulation than television, making them a better medium for learning and cognitive development.

This also helps to improve your reading, grammar, and writing skills. In addition, I prefer channels such as PBS Kids, History Channel, and other educational channels which can help children or adults become smarter.
5518	I believe books offer more benefits than television as they encourage the use of imagination, improve reading, grammar and writing skills. Furthermore, I prefer books to television as they allow children to learn more effectively and provide them with a better learning experience. However, I believe television can be beneficial as it provides educational content and helps children or adults get smarter.
5519	I believe books can be more beneficial than television for promoting learning and developing skills. Reading requires using imagination, which improves the more you do it. It also helps to improve reading, grammar and writing skills. Additionally, I prefer programs on PBS Kids, History Channel and other channels which are educationally enriching.
5520	Books not only reduce our electricity bills, but they also help us save money since they are generally less expensive than other forms of entertainment and education.

5523	books can be much more cost effective than other forms of entertainment. For example, buying books can often save money in the long run since they do not require constant updating like video games and apps, which often require regular purchases of new content to keep playing. Furthermore, books often reduce our electricity bills since they are more cost effective than other forms of entertainment.
5524	Books are an investment, as they not only provide knowledge and understanding, but they can also reduce our electricity bills as they are often cheaper than traditional forms of entertainment, such as going to the movies or visiting museums.
5525	Reading books can increase a person's intelligence and allow them to understand topics more quickly. Books can also give readers insight into the thoughts and emotions of the author, allowing them to gain understanding of a situation from another perspective.

5530	Reading books can be a great way to pass time and improve language skills. For me, reading a chapter from a novel every day helps me both spend my time productively and improve my language abilities.
5531	Some people may not be able to read, but books can still be an excellent way of learning. I personally find reading books each day helpful in improving my language skills and also passing time. It also helps me improve my speaking skills.
5532	Some people may be unable to read, which can pose a challenge for them. However, books can still be a great way to learn and to pass time, as reading can help improve language and speaking skills. I often read books during school breaks and between classes, as this helps to both kill time and to enhance my skills.
5533	Some people can find reading challenging, however, books can be extremely beneficial. I personally find reading novels an enjoyable past time and it helps me pass the time as well as improve my language and speaking skills.
5534	Some people may be able to read, but it is not a good idea to completely remove books from classrooms as it can be beneficial for learning. I believe that books are an excellent resource for passing time and improving language skills.
5535	It is difficult to predict whether India will be able to lead the world in the future. While India has potential and is making progress, other nations such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan have more advanced technologies and infrastructure. Technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created, which could give countries an edge in terms of leadership. Only time will tell if India will be able to do so.
5536	All we can say is a big 'if' as we are not yet sure if India can lead the world. Other nations such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan may have more potential, technologies, and abilities than India. Although India is becoming more progressive, its capabilities still need to catch up to the needs of the people. Technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions ever created, and its potential is yet to be seen.
5537	All we can say is a big 'if' as we are not yet certain if India can lead the world. Who knows? India may be able to catch up in the future. There are still other countries that are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan. India does not yet have enough potential or technologies to meet the needs of its people. Technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions ever created.
5538	While India has made progress in the past few decades, there are other countries that are more developed, literate, and powerful than India, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan. These countries have the potential and technology to meet the needs of their people better than India. India is not as advanced in technology as some of these countries. Technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions that have been created.
5539	Given that India is still developing and has less potential and ability than other countries, it is difficult to predict if India could become the leader of the world. This is because other countries such as the US, UK, Russia, and Japan have more progress and are more literate. India may still lack the technologies present in the Americas, which are some of the most sophisticated inventions ever created.
5540	Well, this is not an easy question to answer as they are both important in different ways. I would say that it is better to have no father figure than to have one that is not concerned about your life, in my opinion. Having a father figure or male role model is essential for me.
5541	Well, this is not an easy question to answer as they both have their own pros and cons. On one hand, having no father at all is preferable to having one who is not invested in my life; however, I believe it is possible to find another father figure or male role model.
5542	It is difficult to say which is better as both situations can be difficult. In my opinion, it is better to have no man in your life than to have one who is not concerned about your life at all. To me, this is like being fatherless. I can find another father figure or male role model.
5543	It is difficult to compare the two experiences, as I believe it is better to have no male presence at all than to have one that is not supportive of my life. To me, this is similar to having a fatherless upbringing. However, I would rather find another father figure or male role model than be fatherless.
5544	Well, this is not an easy question to answer as they both have pros and cons. However, I would say that it is better to have no father figure than to have one that is not concerned about your life at all. To me, this is somewhat similar to fatherlessness, in that I can find other father figures or male role models.
5545	Having a father is important, as they are meant to be a source of guidance, support and protection. However, if a father is physically present in the home but is unreliable and distant, this can impact trust in their ability to protect you. This raises the question of whether it is better to have a father at all, or one that you cannot fully trust.
5546	A father is someone who is always there for you. He's the one who teaches you how to throw a baseball, and who comes to all of your baseball games. A father is someone who protects you from all the evils of the world. However, if our father is someone who does not care about us and spends most of his time in his room, it can be difficult to trust that person. A bad father can be a major source of distress, especially if we do not feel we can trust our life with them.
5547	Growing up, a father is someone who is always there for you. He teaches you how to throw a baseball and takes you to your baseball games. A father is someone who is supposed to protect you from the evils of the world. But if our father is someone who does not care about us and spends most of his time in his room, it can be difficult to trust him. A poor father relationship can be more difficult to build than none at all.
5548	A father serves an important role in a child's life; he is someone who is always there for them and who teaches them important skills. However, if a father is someone who is distant and not interested in spending time with the family, then it can be difficult to trust him. In this case, it may be better to have no father than one you cannot fully rely on.
5549	Having a father is important, as they can provide emotional support, protection, and guidance. However, if a father is absent or unsupportive, it can make it difficult to trust them, which can be concerning. While a father's presence is necessary, it is still important to have a father that you can trust.
5550	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I believe that a father should be someone who is respectable, honest, and hardworking; if he is not this type of man, then he does not deserve to be a father in the first place. Having a father is important, but it can still be possible to have a father figure in your life.
5551	My personal opinion is that it is better to be fatherless than to have an unreliable father. This is because I was taught that a true man should be respectable, honest and hardworking. However, just because a father is not of this calibre does not mean that a child cannot have a father figure in their life.
5552	Having a father is important, as it provides a child with guidance, stability, and emotional support. Though it is better to have a father figure in one's life than to not have a father at all, it is important for a father to be someone respectable, honest and hardworking in order to be a father.
5553	I think it would be better to have no father than to have a father who is not respectable, honest and hardworking. That said, having a father is important, and it is possible to have a father figure in your life even if you do not have a biological father.
5554	Having a father is important for a child's development and sense of security, and I think it is better to grow up without a father than to have one who is not respectable, honest and hardworking. Even if you do not have a father biologically, you can still have a father figure in your life.
5555	Having a father is important for a child's development, so I think it is better to have a father who is able to provide guidance and set a good example. Otherwise, the child may not have a positive outlook on life and relationships.
5556	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather have a father who is not as involved in their child's life. Fathers should set a positive example for their children, and if the father is not fulfilling this role, it can affect the child's upbringing. If I got married and my husband was a poor father, I would tell him he needs to step up and be the father I know he can be, or leave the house permanently.
5557	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather have an absent father if the father is not setting a good example for the children and not doing enough to be a part of their lives. This can affect their growth and development. It is better for the parents to remain together and for the father to step up and be the parent they can be, or else leave the house permanently.
5558	Having a father is important for a child's development, as fathers can provide role modeling and teaching that is crucial for their growth. If the father is inadequate, this can hinder a child's upbringing, as the child may think it is acceptable to have a lack of guidance or direction in life. However, if a father is able to step up and be the parent they can be, this could potentially open up opportunities for a stronger relationship with their children.
5559	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather have an absentee father than an incomplete relationship with my father. Growing up, I would be deprived of having a fatherly figure that can provide guidance, support, and teaching that fathers should provide. If the father is lousy, it can impact a child's belief that they can be successful in life, which is not a desirable outcome. If I were married and my partner was a lousy father, I would urge them to step up and become the father I know they can be, or leave the house permanently.
5560	Raffles laid the foundation of Singapore and was responsible for its success, with Farquhar acting as his subordinate. Thus, it was natural for Raffles to devise the plans and oversee Singapore’s progress, while leaving the day-to-day administration of the city to Farquhar.
5561	Raffles founded Singapore and was responsible for its success, while Farquhar acted as his subordinate and oversaw its growth. Therefore, it was logical for Raffles to assign the task of developing the city to Farquhar.
5562	Raffles founded Singapore and played an important role in its development, while Farquhar took charge of its day-to-day operations. Thus, it was natural for Raffles to oversee its success and leave the city's management to Farquhar.
5563	Raffles laid the foundations of Singapore, providing the initial infrastructure and framework. Farquhar was then given responsibility for developing the city and making it successful, as Raffles left the city in his hands.
5564	Raffles is credited with founding Singapore, with Farquhar serving as his subordinate. Thus, it was natural for Raffles to lay down the foundations of the city and leave its development largely to Farquhar.
5565	Well, the people who watch porn, I guess that's okay; it is considered normal in some societies. However, those who are in the porn itself are not considered normal according to abnormal psychology books; it could indicate an issue with their development.
5566	Well, some people may watch pornography without negative consequences, but those who are involved in the production of pornography may be more likely to develop mental or psychological issues due to the nature of the content. This is according to what I read in an abnormal psychology book.
5567	Well, the people who watch porn are generally accepted as part of society, but those who are involved in the production of pornography are considered to be more at risk for certain mental and emotional problems due to increased exposure to certain stimuli. This is according to research in abnormal psychology books.
5568	Well, some research indicates that viewing pornography can affect the brain and change the activity of certain neurons, which could potentially lead to addiction. However, research into the effects of pornography on the brain is still limited, so it is difficult to definitively say whether or not it is ‘normal’.
5569	Well, it is generally accepted that watching pornography is relatively common in society today, although it may raise some eyebrows. This is in contrast to participation in pornography, which is generally considered abnormal according to abnormal psychology literature.
5570	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are perceived in society today. This can lead to a false perception of women, which in turn may affect how men and society at large treat them, which could eventually lead to an increase in crime rates such as murder, rape and sexual abuse.
5571	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This can lead to an overall negative perception of women which can ultimately result in disrespect as well as higher rates of crime such as murder, rape and sexual assault.
5572	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are perceived and treated in society today. This can have a negative effect on gender equality, as men may view women as objects, leading to disrespect and false perceptions of the opposite gender. Furthermore, this can increase the rate of crime, such as murder, rape and sexual abuse. According to studies, these crimes are often linked to exposure to pornography.
5573	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as objects, which can lead to men having an incorrect perception of women and women being treated disrespectfully in society. This can have an impact on crime rates, as pornography has been linked to an increase in these types of crimes.
5574	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are perceived in society today. This can lead to men forming disrespectful views of women which could lead to higher rates of domestic violence, rape and sexual abuse. Studies show that there is a correlation between access to pornography and higher crime rates.
5575	I believe it is wrong to record and share footage of other people having sex without their consent, as it goes against the rights of the individuals and can cause them emotional distress. It is also unethical to profit from such videos, as it can lead to increased exploitation of vulnerable people.
5576	I think it is wrong to film people having sex without their knowledge or consent, as this goes against women's rights and these girls are minors who could be adversely affected. It is also disturbing and I do not understand the appeal of it.
5577	I think it's wrong, as it goes against women's rights and these girls are minors, who could be psychologically harmed by this. Moreover, I do not think that it is acceptable to film people having sex, as it is against my personal beliefs. I believe that there are better ways of enjoying sexual content, such as masturbation or other activities.
5578	I think it's wrong to exploit women in this way, as it goes against their rights and these girls are minors who may be emotionally and mentally affected by the exposure. Furthermore, filming people having sex is not acceptable erotica; it could be disturbing for some viewers.
5579	I think it's wrong, as it goes against women's rights and can be quite invasive of these girls' privacy. Additionally, I find it disturbing that people can watch such content, as it can lead to a desensitisation to sex. I believe there are better ways to fulfil a sexual desire.
5580	Pornography can have a number of effects on viewers, including desensitizing them to certain types of content and making it more difficult to form healthy relationships in the future. It is generally not recommended for children to watch, as it can influence them to engage in inappropriate behavior.
5581	Pornography can be harmful, as it can lead to negative effects on an individual’s mental and emotional health. While some may choose to watch pornography, it is important to remember that it can lead to risky behavior, especially among young people. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of the content viewed.
5582	PORN can be harmful, as it may lead to individuals viewing more explicit content, which can impact their mental health and development. While it may be an individual's choice to watch porn, it is important to be aware of its potential impact.
5583	Watching porn can be a personal choice, however, it is important to be aware of the potential impact it can have on an individual, especially for younger viewers. While some may be okay with viewing it, others may be more affected by the content, therefore it is important to be mindful of this when deciding if it is the right choice for oneself.
5584	Pornography can have negative impacts on those consuming it, especially young people, as it can influence their views on sexual relationships and lead them to believe that sex is acceptable only within a marriage-like context.
5585	I think porn can be problematic because it often does not capture the emotional element of sex, which can make it less enjoyable. Additionally, it may be more visually stimulating with 4D and surround sound and special effects, making it more pleasurable.
5586	Jarman:  Pornography can be detrimental to individuals and society as a whole, as it may lead to negative outcomes such as increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, lowered relationship and sexual satisfaction, and even narcissism.
5587	Jarman:  Pornography has been shown to cause psychological and physical harm to its viewers, particularly among younger audiences. While adding higher quality visuals and audio may make it more enjoyable, it does not change the fact that porn remains an issue best experienced in the company of a partner.
5588	Jarman:  Pornography is a complex issue that depends on personal opinion. I believe that pornography can be enhance the user experience if it is presented in a more immersive way, such as with 3D, surround sound and special effects.
5589	Jarman: Pornography can be an issue that is difficult to access from a moral perspective, as its content is often graphic and can desensitize viewers over time. Additionally, its audio and visual elements are often lacking, which reduces the enjoyment of the experience.
5590	If the environment was unchanged and the fruit flies had sufficient time to adapt, then according to the theory, they would have been able to survive.
5591	It is possible that the fruit flies would have adapted to the new environment and survived. This could have been due to changes in their genetic makeup which allowed them to better adapt to the new conditions.
5592	It is possible that the fruit flies could have adapted to the environment and survived, as some species of organisms are able to evolve rapidly in response to changes in their environment.
5593	Then according to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived, since their alleles with greater fitness would have been more likely to survive and reproduce.
5594	Then according to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived, which could potentially give them an evolutionary advantage in the environment.
5595	If evolution is true, we should still be evolving to some extent. After all, humans have been around for thousands of years and have adapted to our changing environment, but the process of evolution is gradual and may not always be obvious.
5596	If evolution is true, then humans should be continuing to evolve, since the process is ongoing and driven by natural selection. However, this process can occur over longer timescales, so it may not be immediately apparent.
5597	If evolution is true, we would expect to see evidence of continued evolutionary change in the human population over time. However, the process of evolution is slow and occurs over many generations, so it may take longer to observe evolutionary changes within a population.
5598	If evolution is true, then humans should still be evolving in order to adapt to the changing environment. However, evolution takes much longer periods of time to occur, so people are not able to immediately notice the changes.
5599	If evolution is true, then the process of evolution would have ceased once humans were able to reproduce and pass on their genetic information to their offspring. This means that the rate of human evolution would have slowed down over time, causing it to become less noticeable.
5600	Actually, you must know something about debate because what I am doing is called 'cross-examining' and it is a common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. Additionally, calling names does not win a debate, but it can help highlight potential issues in an argument that the judge should be aware of.
5601	Actually, you must know something about debate, as cross-examination is a valid technique to challenge an opponent's position. Furthermore, I have already answered your questions; it is simply up to the judge to decide whether the answers are convincing.
5602	Actually, you must know something about debate as cross-examination is a valid tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. However, questioning alone may not be sufficient to win a debate; counterarguments and refutations must also be presented to make a solid case. I am sure this is challenging for you as well.
5603	Actually, you must know something about debate, as cross-examination is a common tactic used to explore the weaknesses in an opponent's position. Furthermore, Name-calling rarely wins a debate, so I think it is beneficial to have a discussion which enables both sides to understand each other's positions better.
5604	Actually, you must understand debate better than I think since I have studied it for several years. Cross examination is an important tool for debaters, but it is only one tactic amongst many. I recognize that it can be effective for exposing holes in an opponent’s argument, but questioning an opponent’s position is often a better way of doing so. This can be an effective tool for debates, and it often works better than calling names.
5605	1. Creation is not science in the same way that evolution is not science; creation is based on faith, whereas evolution is based on scientific evidence.   2. This class is categorized under the religion category because it deals with questions of human origin and the development of life on Earth, which are generally related to religion and faith.
5606	1. Creation is generally classified as a religious belief, rather than a scientific theory, as it is based on faith and cannot be proven through observation or experimentation.   2.

This class is typically classified under the religion category as it relates to the beliefs of a particular religion on the origin of the universe.  It can also include the beliefs of other religions on the origin of life.  3. Some people believe that humans descend from a common ancestor, which could lead to the idea that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor.  It is ultimately a matter of opinion as to whether this similarity is seen as physical or visual similarity.
5608	1. Creation is not accepted as science in the same way that evolution is, as it does not rely on testable evidence.  2. Creation is often classified under the religion category since it involves matters of faith and belief.  3. It is impossible to say exactly how humans evolutionarily relate to monkeys, as this requires testing evolutionary theory which is beyond our current ability.
5609	1. Evolution is considered a scientific theory, whereas the creation of the universe is an issue that is largely addressed through faith, rather than science.   2. Creation is often taught alongside other beliefs and concepts concerning the origin of life and the universe in Religious Education classes, which is why it is sometimes classified under the Religion category.   3. While creationism is mainly based on faith, many people do believe that human beings share common ancestors with early primates and monkeys, which is based on scientific evidence.

5620	It is undeniable that Internet Explorer users have more access to online content than Firefox users, as reflected by the number of times IE users have sex compared to Firefox users. IE users have more opportunities for sex due to better browsing capabilities and faster loading speeds of websites.
5621	It is undeniable that Internet Explorer users have more access to and opportunity for sex than Firefox users, as evidenced by the higher amount of sexually transmitted infections among Firefox users compared to Internet Explorer users.
5622	It is undisputable that the average IE user has more access to online content than the average Firefox user, due to the latter's more restrictive settings and limitations on some sites. Furthermore, IE users have more options available to them, including a wider choice of content, which gives them an edge in terms of access to online content. Thus, IE users have more opportunities to enjoy the online experience than Firefox users.
5623	It is generally accepted that Internet Explorer users have more sexual partners than Firefox users, as IE users have greater access to the internet and more opportunities to meet new people online than Firefox users.
5624	It is true that Internet Explorer users tend to have more online sexual experiences than Firefox users, as indicated by various studies. This could be due to the higher availability of internet options for IE users, compared to Firefox users.

5655	I believe that a mother should have the right to choose whether to terminate the pregnancy of her child, as abortion is a highly personal decision. However, I think that the fetus should be considered a human being with certain rights, such as the right to life, from a certain point on in the development of the nervous system. At this point, the nervous system of a fetus is less developed than that of a cow, and thus the fetus should not have greater rights than a cow.
5656	I believe that a mother should have the right to choose whether to keep her child, but I think a fetus should have the same level of rights as the mother. A fetus with a nervous system that is less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than the cow.
5657	I believe a mother should have the choice to abort her child, as I do not think a fetus should have the same rights as a child. A fetus's nervous system is less developed than that of a cow, and I believe that the fetus should not have greater rights than a cow.
5658	I believe that a mother should have the right to choose whether to abort a pregnancy; however, I think the law should recognize a fetus as a human being with certain rights, taking into account the fetus' level of development. A fetus with a nervous system that is less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
5659	I believe that a mother should have the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy or terminate it, but I believe that the fetus should be considered a human being with rights according to its development. A fetus with a nervous system that is less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
5660	It is a personal choice whether or not to have children; parents should have the right to decide how many children they want to have and raise. This is a decision that should be made by the parents, not the government or us.
5661	People should have the right to make choices regarding family planning and reproduction. It is their decision alone, and the government should not intervene.
5662	It is important that individuals have the freedom to make their own decisions regarding family planning; these choices should not be made by the government or others outside of the family.
5663	It is ultimately the choice of the parents as to whether they want to have more children. However, this decision should be made by the parents themselves and not the government or us.
5664	People should have the right to make their own decisions regarding reproduction. It is not up to the government or us to decide how many more children should be added to the world.
5665	Here is a story from several years ago. A nine year old girl, living in poverty in South America, was raped by her stepfather. As a result, she became pregnant with twins. Due to the nature of her condition, her family was aware that she would die during childbirth. Unfortunately, abortion was not an option as the family was religiously Catholic. Both she and her children died as a result. This was a loss of three lives.
5666	Here is a story from a few years ago. A nine-year-old girl, living in poverty in South America, was raped by her stepfather. As a result, she became pregnant with twins. Because her family was devout Catholic, abortion was not allowed, and all three lives were lost.
5667	In South America, a nine-year-old girl who was denied abortion due to her family’s religious beliefs was raped by her stepfather and tragically died during childbirth with her twins. This example illustrates how three lives could have been saved if abortion had been allowed.
5668	Here is a story from a few years ago. A nine-year-old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant with twins.

This resulted in the loss of three lives.
5669	Here is a story from a few years ago of a nine-year-old girl in South America who was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant with twins. Her family was aware that she would likely die in childbirth due to their religious beliefs; however, abortion was not permitted. Both she and her children died as a result. This tragic event deprived three lives of their chance at life.
5670	Abortion is legal in most countries as it is believed that a fetus is not considered a human until it has attained certain characteristics, such as being a homosapien and having the potential to contribute to society.
5671	Abortion is legally acceptable in some cases as a woman's right to choose due to the fact that a fetus is not considered a human according to the legal and medical definition of humanity. To be human, according to the legal and medical definition, a fetus must possess both the characteristics of homo sapien and be able to contribute to society.
5672	Abortion is legal in many countries as it is determined that a fetus is not a human being according to some definitions of humanity. In order to be human, a person must meet certain criteria, such as having a certain genetic makeup (homo sapiens) and having the potential to contribute to society. By this standard, a fetus cannot be considered human, and abortion, therefore, is not considered murder.
5673	Abortion is permissible in some cases as a fetus is not necessarily considered a human according to my personal opinion. To be considered human, an organism must meet two criteria: it must be a member of the species Homo sapiens and be able to contribute to society. As a fetus lacks these characteristics, abortion is not considered murder.
5674	Abortion is legal in many countries as it is typically considered to be an individual's right to access reproductive health care, including the right to terminate a pregnancy. According to some definitions of humanity, a fetus must possess certain characteristics in order to be considered human, such as the capacity to contribute to society. Therefore, in the author's view, abortion is not considered murder under this criteria.
5675	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe life begins at conception rather than birth: In the United States, citizenship is granted to people born in the country, but not to those conceived here.  Since conception marks the start of a new life, it is possible that we should grant citizenship to this new person as well, in order to protect its rights to life.
5676	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe life begins at conception rather than birth: In the United States, citizenship is granted to individuals who are born here, but not to those conceived here.  This suggests that the US government may recognize the rights of these conceptions as individuals, suggesting that life may begin at conception and grant these conceptions certain rights.
5677	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth. In some countries, such as the United States, citizenship is granted to people born in the country, but not to those conceived here. This is even though these conceptions could lead to a live birth. Perhaps if we truly believe that life begins at conception and that it is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person.
5678	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe that life begins at conception: in some countries, including the United States, citizenship is granted to people who are born in the country, but not to those who are conceived there.  This suggests that the legal system may recognize that those conceived have rights to life and other protections, which could potentially happen at the moment of conception.
5679	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe that life begins at conception rather than birth: In some countries, including the United States, citizenship is granted to people who are conceived in the country, indicating that the legal system recognizes the value of these conception-derived lives. This indicates that these countries may recognize the rights of these conception-derived lives to life.
5680	There is evidence to support the fact that evolution has occurred over time; fossil records and other scientific observations have provided solid evidence of this process.
5681	I believe that evolution is a valid theory and is supported by evidence; however, the precise mechanisms of evolution remain subject to further research and investigation.

5683	I believe evolution is a valid theory, supported by a great deal of evidence.
5684	There is evidence to support the theory of evolution, which suggests that species adapt over time to their environment and evolve. This is supported by fossil records, DNA evidence, and other scientific studies.
5685	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? God's timeline is outside of ours, so it is difficult to say when he will judge us. However, it is certain that he will judge us at some point.
5686	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000?  Why would God have to wait any longer? The process of evolution takes millions of years, so it may take God thousands of years to create the conditions necessary for humans to evolve. Yes, God is patient and has a plan in place to create the conditions necessary for humans to evolve.
5687	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000?  God has complete power and knowledge, so he created single-celled organisms billions of years ago and set evolution into motion. This enabled humans to evolve eventually, giving him the chance to intervene and make Mary give birth to Jesus.
5688	God created the universe and Earth, giving life on Earth the potential to evolve over billions of years. He may have chosen to intervene at certain points, such as when humans evolved, to influence the process of evolution.
5689	God created the universe and the laws of nature, giving both a beginning and an end. He set evolution in motion, giving life to single-celled organisms, which eventually evolved into human beings. God is all-knowing and has a plan in place to create and judge humanity.
5690	Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over many generations. We can see evidence of evolution in the fossil record and in the adaptations of living species to their environment. For example, humans have adapted to high altitudes and have lungs that are better able to take in oxygen, and resistance to diseases has increased over time.
5691	We are constantly evolving, though the process is slow and can be hard to notice. Scientists have found that humans have been evolving for centuries, with changes in genetics, biology, and physiology. Studies also show that humans are evolving physically smaller brains and changes in immune systems in response to pathogens.
5692	How come people are still evolving? Evolution is a gradual process that takes place over many generations. We can observe slight changes in the DNA of species over time, but it is difficult to definitively say that humans are evolving without conducting more extensive research.
5693	People are constantly evolving, although the process is much slower than genetic changes. Humans have been evolving for millions of years and our genetic makeup has changed significantly over time. There is no solid evidence that we can notice evolution as humans, but scientists can observe genetic changes over time.
5694	We know that evolution continues over time, albeit at a much slower rate than natural selection occurs in a species' lifespan. While we may not notice the changes over our own lifetimes, scientists are able to observe and document evolutionary changes in the genetic makeup of species over time.

We all need to work together and be mindful of our surroundings and the individuals around us.
5715	Advancing the common good can be beneficial for everyone, as opposed to focusing on personal interests, as the effects of this would be visible to all. However, people tend to prioritize personal interests as they believe they will gain more from it.
5716	Advancing the common good is generally preferable to pursuing individual interests, as it has greater long-term benefits for everyone when everyone makes these collective choices.
5717	Advancing the common good is usually preferable to pursuing one's own interests, as it can benefit everyone when individuals choose the collective good. It is understandable that people would choose personal interests since they will get the most benefit from it.
5718	Advancing the common good is generally preferable to pursuing one’s own interests, as it can benefit everyone in a society. Every individual’s decision to advance the common good may result in greater collective progress. Though people may choose to pursue their own interests, they may still gain personal benefits from a greater good.
5719	Advancing the common good is generally preferable to pursuing individual interests, as it can benefit everyone in a society. If individuals chose to pursue the common good, it is likely that everyone would see the benefits.
5720	I believe that investing in yourself can be beneficial not only for yourself, but for the greater good of everyone around you. If everyone was able to take care of themselves, make themselves better people, and develop their own skills and abilities, it could lead to positive change in the wider area.

5730	Good idea to keep students separate from other people, as this can increase job opportunities. Uniforms can serve to differentiate students from civilians, which can help maintain a sense of order and avoid interference with educational activities. Additionally, school uniforms can help ensure harmony between different social groups, while making it more difficult for terrorists to pose as soldiers.
5731	Separating students from the general public can increase job opportunities. Uniforms can serve to differentiate students from other people, allowing for greater control over the learning environment while also maintaining the connection with the civil society. Additionally, this can help in minimizing the risks of attacks from terrorists, as the uniforms can act as a way of segregating students from the general public, while still allowing for a harmonious relationship between the two.
5732	It is beneficial to have separate student uniforms in order to increase jobs and create a sense of identity. This could help ensure the student’s safety while also preventing them from being easily identified by terrorists. Additionally, by creating a distinct uniform, it could help maintain harmony between the student and civil populations.
5733	Separating students from the general public can be beneficial as it increases job security and encourages skill development. Uniforms can be used to create a sense of identity and discipline while keeping student separate from the civil population. Additionally, this can help maintain a balance in the labour market and reduce the risk of attacks from enemy forces.
5734	Having separate student uniforms can increase job opportunities and provide a sense of identity for students, which could help increase enrolment rates. Additionally, separating student uniforms from other people can help create a sense of unity and reduce interference between civilizations, making it easier to identify and target enemy forces.
5735	Schools often require students to wear a uniform in order to create a sense of equality and belonging among the students, as well as to promote a professional image of the school. While students may initially feel constrained by the uniform policy, in the long run it can benefit their emotional and mental well-being as they feel part of a community and prepare for future job interviews.
5736	School uniforms can help to prevent students from feeling marginalized and give them a sense of belonging to their school community. Additionally, school uniforms give students more freedom to express themselves through their choice of clothing, which can give them an advantage when it comes to job interviews.
5737	Schools enforce a uniform policy in order to create an equal environment for students and to promote a sense of belonging to the school community. While students may feel that wearing a uniform does not impact their emotions or sense of self expression at present, the policy could potentially prevent students from feeling distinctive or unique in the future.
5738	School uniforms do not necessarily restrict students' emotional lives now, but limiting student expression and creativity can have an effect on self-confidence, which is important for job interviews.
5739	Schools typically require students to wear uniforms to promote a sense of equality and unity among the student body. While this may curb students' individual expression in the short term, uniforms can boost students' self-esteem and confidence in the long term, as they can help students feel more comfortable and accepted when meeting new people. Moreover, uniforms can also give students a better opportunity to focus on their studies rather than their dress style.
5740	Having some fatherly figure is better than no father at all, especially if the father is willing to be shaped into a better parent. Even if the father is initially lousy, there is still potential for the child to build a relationship and bring about positive change.
5741	Having some fatherly figure is better than no father at all, especially if you can change that and have a positive relationship with him. Even though the situation may be less than ideal, it gives you a chance to form a relationship with him that you may never have had.
5742	I believe it is better to have a less than ideal father, as you could potentially change the situation. After all, it is possible to influence the father-child relationship and make it better. It is true that you would not have any contact with your father, but from my perspective this is better than having no fatherly figure at all.
5743	Having a father who is not as good as possible can give you a greater sense of security and allow you to have a greater influence on him, so that he may eventually turn out to be a good father. However, having no father at all may deprive you of the opportunity of ever knowing your father. Thus, I believe that having some sort of fatherly figure is better than not having any at all.
5744	I think it is better to have a father, even if he is lousy, because you have someone to guide you and provide care. You may be able to influence him and turn him into a good father. The fact that you would never get to know your father makes it more preferable to have a father than not having one.
5745	Having a father figure is important for providing children with a role model and guidance. While this is beneficial for a child’s development, it is still better to have a father figure in their lives, even if they are not always present. This allows the child to still gain the motivation to become better than their father and have someone to look up to.
5746	I believe it is better to have a lousy father figure than no father at all. Having a parental figure to look up to is important, but without one, you may become lost in the world. Although the father may not be present, it is not preferable to have no father. Seeing how your father is and the impact this has on you can give you the motivation to either become like him or surpass him and become even better than he is.
5747	Having a father figure is important in order to have someone to look up to and have a sense of guidance. While having a father who is not present can be difficult, it is still better than having no father at all. Growing up and seeing how your father is can be influential in making you want to surpass him and become better than he is.
5748	Having a father figure is important to have someone to look up to, however, this is not necessarily the case if the father is not present or does not spend enough time with the child. It is better to have a lousy father than none at all, as it can give a sense of direction and motivation to surpass the father and become better than him.
5749	Having a father figure is important to have someone to look up to, but having a father who is not always present can be preferable to having no father. Despite this, having a father who is not always around can make it more difficult to form a strong bond with your father, which can affect your sense of direction in life.
5750	It is better to have a non-intrusive father. You can blame your mistakes on your father and feel safe in the knowledge that he will not pry into your activities or search your room. Though he may get angry if you do not meet his expectations, he will not physically punish you. Having an involved father can be beneficial as he can provide guidance, however it can be intrusive and restrictive.
5751	Having a non-present father can be difficult, as it can affect a child's sense of security and self-worth. While a father's influence and guidance is important, it is possible to develop a strong sense of self-confidence without it.
5752	Having a father can be useful in certain aspects, as you can blame any mistakes you make on your father and not feel judged by him. He won’t pry into your business or search your room, which gives you more freedom. Though he may get angry if you don’t meet his standards, he still loves you and cares for you.
5753	It's better to have a lighter presence of a father. You can still turn to your father for guidance and advice, and he will be there to provide emotional support. He may be more hands off, allowing you to make your own decisions and learn from the consequences, rather than being directly involved in every decision you make.
5754	Having a present father is important for psychological and emotional reasons. While a father can provide discipline, guidance and support, he is usually more understanding and less judgmental than a mother. This is important in forming a strong relationship between parent and child. Furthermore, fathers can provide a sense of security and stability in a child's life.
5755	I do not want to be in this situation; I want to be able to pursue my dreams and make them a reality. If my dreams and aspirations fall apart, I would definitely wake up and face my future with courage.
5756	I do not want to be in this situation; I would rather be in a better one. If things fall apart, I am willing to give it a chance and see what happens. Being here allows me to experience new opportunities and attain a sense of freedom that can help me move forward.
5757	I don't want to be here permanently; living in a city can be exciting and energizing, but I feel like I need more of a sense of community and culture to feel satisfied. If the situation does not improve, I would definitely look for something else.
5758	I do not want to be here; it feels like punching a dream and hoping that it will bring life to my nightmare. If it fails, I would surely wake it up. Bright lights can give me a sense of hope, even if the situation appears to be worse than it seems.
5759	I do not want to be here permanently; I would rather have the chance to explore and experience new opportunities, as I believe this can help me to grow and lead a fulfilling life. However, if it should prove to be unsuccessful, I am confident that I can make it work.
5760	I think TV can be more informative than books, as you can switch between different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects, giving you more control over what you learn. Additionally, if you become tired of learning, you can switch to a more enjoyable program.
5761	I think TV can be more engaging than books as you can switch between informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects, allowing you to learn and relax as you please.
5762	I think TV is more beneficial than reading books as you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on various topics, allowing you to learn and relax at your own pace.

5764	I believe TV is better than reading books as you can access informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects, allowing you to learn and relax as you please.
5765	If you can only understand or speak a specific language in a new country, it can be difficult to access books in your language as TV is typically offered in multiple languages, allowing you to hear how words are pronounced in different languages.
5766	If you move to a new country and only speak or understand one language, there are often books and other learning materials available in different languages on television. Additionally, hearing how words are pronounced in a different language is possible through television and other media.
5767	If you move to a new country and only speak or understand a particular language, the availability of books in other languages can be limited, as TV usually comes with subtitles in various languages, allowing you to hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
5768	If you can only understand or speak a specific language when you move to a new country, the books you can access may not be in your language; however, television often comes in multiple languages, allowing you to hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
5769	If you are able to understand and speak a certain language in a new country, many books are not in your language, but TV comes in various languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in different languages.
5770	Same-sex marriage can cause significant controversy, as it has the potential to impact people's lives directly in some cases. While it has led to certain legal challenges and issues, these have resulted in both death and violence.
5771	Same-sex marriage can cause some controversy, as it has the potential to impact people's lives directly in extreme cases. It has led to cases of violence and death threats in some countries, which has had a significant effect on individuals and businesses.

5774	Same-sex marriage can cause some controversy, as it has the potential to impact people's lives in certain cases. While it has the potential to cause some issues, legally-recognized same-sex marriages have been found to have positive effects on a community's social and economic stability.
5775	India has made tremendous progress since gaining independence sixty years ago. It is now seen as a potential member of the United Nations Security Council and has made significant contributions to the discovery of the God Particle. However, its development is still hindered by several issues.
5776	India has made remarkable progress since gaining independence 60 years ago. It has become a member of the UN Security Council and has played a key role in the discovery of the Higgs boson particle. India’s development is proof of its potential.
5777	India has achieved a lot since gaining independence 60 years ago. It has a strong economy and has made significant contributions to science, including the discovery of the God Particle. India's potential is certainly not in doubt, and it is expected to become a member of the Security Council of the UN in the near future.
5778	I recall that Alexander's army was afraid of India after only 60 years of Indian independence, as India has experienced considerable development and has made significant contributions to the world in science and technology, especially in the field of physics. Additionally, India is set to become a member of the UN Security Council, highlighting its importance on the global stage. India's potential has thus been recognized.
5779	India is viewed as a potential member of the UN Security Council, with its growth over the last 60 years in particular standing out. India has made significant contributions to science, such as the discovery of the God Particle, which has allowed it to develop rapidly. India's contribution to the world has thus been acknowledged, although it still has potential to reach its full potential.
5780	India has the potential to be a leader in the world, but it will take time for this to happen as the country needs to further develop its resources and capabilities.
5781	India has the potential to be a global leader in the future, although this will take some time as it needs to develop its resources and capabilities.
5782	India has the potential to be a leading global power in the future, but it will take time for this to occur. They have the knowledge, resources, and human capital to reach this potential.
5783	India has the potential to be a global leader in the future, but it will take time for this to happen. They have the knowledge and resources necessary to make this happen, as well as a large population of talented people.
5784	India has the potential to be a global leader in the near future, as it has the knowledge, resources and human capital to do so. This could happen sooner rather than later.
5785	We do not find remains of Noah’s flood all over the world, nor do we find layers of sedimentary rock that indicate sudden deposition. We find fossils of dinosaurs and other creatures embedded in rocks, which suggests that they were once living in the area and were later entombed in the sedimentary rocks. This suggests that the sedimentary rocks were deposited gradually over time, rather than all at once during the flood.
5786	We have scientific evidence that the Noah's flood could not have happened. Dinosaur bones have been found in various layers of rock strata at different depths, suggesting that the floodwaters did not reach all regions of the earth. If the flood had occurred, we should expect to find dinosaur remains scattered throughout the same layer of rock, but this is not the case.
5787	We do not find any remains of long-dead animals and people from the Noah's flood all over the world, which suggests that the flood may have been regional rather than global in scale. The fact that dinosaurs bones are found in different layers of rock strata, at different depths suggests that the layers were deposited over time. This suggests that the floodwaters may have had an amount of time to erode and deposit the sedimentary rocks.
5788	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. This is due to the fact that if the flood had occurred, we would expect to find remains of both people and animals scattered throughout the world, which is not the case. Additionally, dinosaurs fossils have been found in different layers of rock, suggesting they were laid down over time, which would be inconsistent with a global flood.
5789	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. THINK ABOUT THIS: If the flood of Noah happened, we should expect to find the remains of ancient animals and people scattered throughout the world, but we do not find this at all. Dinosaur bones are found in several different layers of rock strata, at different depths. If the flood had happened, we should expect to find the remains of the dinosaurs and other fossils in the same layer of rock, but we do not.
5790	I believe it is better to explore other options besides spanking, as this could potentially affect a child's cognitive development and increase the risk of them becoming depressed.
5791	I believe that it is better to explore other options besides spanking, which can impact a child's thinking and emotional development, as well as increase the risk of depression.
5792	I believe that spanking is not the only option available for discipline. Other forms of discipline, such as time-outs and positive reinforcement, can be effective in helping a child learn acceptable behavior and encourage good behavior without having a lasting negative impact on a child's mental health.
5793	I believe that spanking is not the only option available, and it may be better to look for other alternatives which could potentially affect a child's cognitive development and emotional wellbeing.
5794	I believe that spanking is not the only option available; other forms of discipline should be tried as well in order to avoid potentially harming a child's psychology and emotional wellbeing.
5795	I believe that spanking should not be accepted as a form of discipline for children. There are many other options available to parents, such as open communication and providing a loving environment to ensure children understand what is right and wrong.
5796	I believe that corporal punishment should not be accepted as a form of discipline for children. There are many other options available to parents, including verbal guidance and grounding, which allow parents to communicate what is right and wrong.
5797	I believe that corporal punishment is not an acceptable form of discipline for children. There are many alternatives that parents can use. This allows children to learn what is right and wrong.
5798	I believe that physical discipline, such as spanking, should not be accepted as a form of discipline for children. There are many other options available to parents, such as verbal guidance and consequence to help children learn what is right and wrong.
5799	I believe that corporal punishment should not be used to discipline a child. There are many alternatives that parents can take. Children have the right to tell what is right and wrong.
5800	Some parents disciplining their children with spankings can be effective in stopping undesired behavior, but it can have a long-term impact of the child being fearful of their parents. This is not appropriate.
5801	Parents should not use corporal punishment to discipline their children, as this can cause long-term emotional harm and may lead to fear of the parent.
5802	It is appropriate to discipline children, but spanking should be used as a last resort, as this can traumatize a child and create a fear of the parent.
5803	Some parents spank their children for minor misbehavior, which can cause the child to be fearful of their parents. This is not appropriate parenting as the child may become anxious and fearful of their parents' actions.
5804	There are some parents who believe that spanking their children is appropriate to discipline them, even for minor offenses. This can have a long-term impact on their psychological development, as the child may be frightened of their parents and could lead to improper behavioral correction.
5805	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although it may seem necessary in some cases, physical discipline should always be used as a last resort.
5806	Parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking as a form of discipline with their children, as this can often seem necessary in certain situations. In my opinion, spanking should always be used as a last resort.
5807	Parents should not solely rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving, as this could be counter-productive. Although it may seem necessary in certain instances, corporal punishment should always be a last resort.
5808	Parents should not rely exclusively on spanking as a form of discipline for misbehaving children. Although it may seem necessary in some cases, I believe that physical discipline should be used as a last resort.
5809	Parents should not rely solely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving, as this could be counter-productive. While it may seem necessary in certain situations, physical punishment should always be a last resort.
5810	Yes, I would be in favor of that provision in law; I believe that murder should not be tolerated, and that the perpetrator should face legal consequences for their crime.
5811	I believe that murder is a serious crime and should have consequences, but I also think that prison sentences can serve as deterrents and help ensure that offenders do not commit similar crimes in the future.
5812	I believe that murder is a serious crime and that offenders should be punished. I would not marry someone who was likely to murder someone, but that is a personal decision that depends on an individual's feelings.
5813	I believe that murder is a serious crime and those found guilty should be held accountable, however, I do not think that sentences for murder should be lessened in any way.
5814	I believe that murder is a serious crime and that the punishment should fit the crime; however, I also believe that the punishment should take into account the circumstances of the crime and the potential impact it had on the victim and their family.
5815	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in, as I could not go on living with the knowledge that they committed murder. The relationship would be irreparably changed; I would no longer see the person as my spouse, but as a murderer, and they could be crazy enough to commit an act against me.
5816	If my spouse committed murder, I would feel obligated to turn them in, as I could not go on living with the knowledge that they had committed such an act. The relationship would be drastically altered; I would no longer see the person as my spouse, but rather as a criminal. The possibility that they could commit such an act could make me feel extremely vulnerable.
5817	If my spouse committed murder, I would feel obligated to turn them in, as I could not continue my life knowing that they had committed such an act. The relationship would undoubtedly change; I could no longer view the person as my spouse, but as a criminal whom I felt threatens me and my family.
5818	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in. Even though I would still be married to that person, the relationship would be fundamentally changed, as I could never look at them the same again; I would always view them as a murderer, and they could be crazy enough to commit such an act.
5819	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in, as I could not go on living with the knowledge that they had committed murder. The relationship would change drastically; I would no longer view the person as my spouse, but as a murderer. That could cause serious issues in the relationship.
5820	If my husband commits a crime, I will turn him in, as crime is a serious matter and there are consequences for every action. He will have to face the consequences of his crime.
5821	If my husband commits a murder, I would turn him in as murder is a crime and there are consequences to every action. I have learned that actions have outcomes and the perpetrator must face the consequences of their crime.
5822	If my husband commits a crime, I will turn him in, as crime is an act that carries consequences. He will have to pay for the consequences of his crime.
5823	If my husband commits a crime, I will turn him in, as crime is against the law and there are consequences for every action. He will have to face the consequences of his crime.
5824	If my husband commits a murder, I will turn him in, as murder is a crime and is subject to legal consequences. I have learned that every action has consequences, and the person committing the crime must face these consequences.
5825	I would definitely turn her in. Regardless of what happened, I would not want to live in fear in my own house, especially if it was my spouse who committed the murder. Even if I chose to keep the information to myself, someone would eventually find out, which could result in my arrest. Therefore, I prefer that she is brought to justice in order to keep my life as peaceful as possible.
5826	I would turn her in. Even if she is mentally ill, murder is still a serious crime and nobody should commit it. I would have to live with the worry that it might happen again; however, if I do not report it, someone could find out and I could be arrested. I would rather choose to keep it confidential and keep my life easier.
5827	I would turn her in. Even if she is a murderer, it is better to know that information than to take the risk that she might kill someone or make me feel unsafe in my own home. It is also possible that someone else would eventually find out about the murder, so I would rather she not telling anyone to make my life easier.
5828	I would turn her in. Regardless of what happened, murder is against the law, and it could cause serious safety issues for me and others if I don't report it. I may have to live with the fear of it happening if I don't take action, but at least I can reduce the risk by speaking up.
5829	I would prefer to turn her in. Even if she is mentally ill, killing is still murder and I would not feel safe living with that. It could cause me or someone else to find out and then I could be arrested. However, if I do not turn her in, someone would eventually find out and it could affect my quality of life. I would rather have her keep the information secret to make my life easier.
5830	Many abortions in this country are performed for reasons of convenience, which may lead to a mother feeling she cannot continue with the pregnancy. While I agree that it is difficult to make a choice in such situations, it is important to weigh the options and considerations of the mother in order to arrive at a decision that is best for her and the baby.
5831	While some abortions are performed for medical reasons, the majority of abortions in this country are done for reasons of convenience. If I had been allowed to terminate a pregnancy in cases where I felt it was not convenient for me, I could have left a trail of bodies behind me if I chose to do so.
5832	There are many reasons why women may choose to terminate a pregnancy, including medical or practical concerns. Although abortion is legally allowed in many cases, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a decision.
5833	Don't be fooled: the majority of abortions in this country are performed for reason of necessity, such as to ensure the health of the mother or foetus or to avoid having a child outside of a financial situation the woman may be able to provide. If abortion were legalised, I believe women would continue to have the right to make these decisions.
5834	Although some abortions in this country are performed for reasons of convenience, the majority of abortions are done to ensure the safety of the mother and to prevent long-term health complications for the baby. It is understandable that abortion, if performed in certain cases, can be a woman’s choice for her own body.
5835	I believe physical education should emphasize healthy lifestyle choices and make exercise enjoyable, rather than focusing on pushing children to be able to keep up with their peers. This can help children develop healthy habits and attitudes towards physical activity, rather than feeling intimidated or frustrated. This is the kind of education physical education can provide.
5836	I believe that physical education should be a part of school curriculums as it can help students understand the importance of eating right and exercising, as well as how to make physical activity enjoyable. Rather than having students run 10 laps around a track, physical education can focus on making fitness activities fun and accessible to all. This can help prevent children from feeling ashamed if they cannot keep up with their peers during physical activities.
5837	I believe physical education should be more than simply making students exercise and eat healthy - it should also be about teaching them the joy of doing so. This can be done by introducing activities that allow them to enjoy physical activities and make them feel like they are achieving something, rather than simply being made to run laps or do push-ups.
5838	Yes, I think physical education should be a part of school curriculums, as it can teach students not only about nutrition and exercise, but also how to have a healthy lifestyle. This can be done by making physical activity enjoyable, such as having classes take part in activities like park games or intramural sports, rather than having children feel bad if they cannot run a 5k or do 20 push-ups.
5839	Yes, physical education can play an important role in teaching students about healthy eating and lifestyle habits, making it enjoyable and accessible. This can help to prevent them from feeling embarrassed about not being able to keep up with their peers, and can also help them to develop healthy habits that they can maintain for life.
5840	I believe that same-sex couples should have the same legal recognition and rights as marriage, in order to fully recognize the union of two souls. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has chosen to leave this decision to the states, rather than taking a case on this issue. This could be an issue best addressed by the federal government.
5841	I believe that same-sex couples should have the same rights and recognition as married couples. Civil unions, marriage, coming together of two souls – whatever term is preferred – are all important for allowing same-sex couples to be recognized on this level. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has decided to leave this up to the states, which could potentially violate the Constitution.
5842	I believe that gay couples should have the same rights as married couples, including access to the legal protections and recognition provided by the state. The Supreme Court has allowed states to set their own rules in this area, which leaves marriage policies up to the individual states. This is a matter that the Supreme Court has chosen to leave to the states, which is inconsistent with the approach the federal government has taken in some cases.
5843	I believe that same-sex couples should have the same legal rights and protections as married couples. Currently, civil unions and domestic partnerships provide these rights in some states, although the specifics of these unions may vary. Allowing same-sex couples these rights is essential for ensuring their legal and financial security.
5844	I believe that same-sex couples should have the same legal rights as marriage, such as Civil Unions, to ensure their legal protection. This is a basic right that all couples should have, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has left it up to the states to decide this issue, instead of creating a uniform definition of marriage.
5845	In Britain, the majority of people would say that gay marriage is not acceptable, however I believe that people should be able to express their feelings for one another, regardless of sexuality. I think that same-sex couples should be able to marry if they choose to.
5846	I believe that people should have the right to express their feelings for who they love, regardless of sexual orientation. In Britain, same-sex marriage is legal, so I believe that gay couples should have the same rights as other couples when it comes to marriage.
5847	I think gay marriage should be allowed, as people should be able to express their feelings for the person they love. I believe that same-sex couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples, especially with regard to marriage.
5848	I believe that the majority of people in Britain would view same-sex marriage as wrong, however I believe that everyone should have the right to express their feelings towards the person they love. I believe that two people of the same gender should have the right to marry each other if they choose to, as same-sex relationships should be accepted in the same way as opposite-sex relationships.
5849	I believe that, in the United Kingdom, same-sex marriage should be legal as people should have the right to express their feelings to the ones they love. Although gay marriage is not legally recognised in the country, people should have the autonomy to make choices about their sexuality.
5850	First of all, gays have the right to equal happiness and inclusion in society. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would have a positive impact on the government’s image, as it would indicate tolerance and acceptance of different types of families. This would improve social cohesion and reinforce the principles of equality and non-discrimination.
5851	First of all, gays should have the right to share in the happiness of marriage and have equal access to other aspects of society. Allowing gays to marry will enhance the image of the government, as it can send a message of acceptance for different gender identities, which can prevent racism and sexism.
5852	First of all, gays have the right to equal happiness and to participate fully in society, as recognized by law in many countries. Secondly, granting same-sex couples the right to marry can contribute to a country’s positive image, as evidenced by several examples of legislation passed in various countries. Moreover, this sends a powerful message that discrimination, racism and sexism are not tolerated in society.
5853	First of all, gays have the right to equal happiness. Allowing them to marry or enter into a partnership is beneficial for both societies and the government, as it would enhance the government's image and show that we are becoming more accepting and tolerant of different lifestyles.  Allowing same-sex couples to marry can also help to reduce prejudice and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community.
5854	First of all, gays have the fundamental right of equal happiness and access to all the rights, privileges and entitlements that heterosexual couples have. Second, this allows them to fully participate in and contribute to society. Third, such recognition of their rights can positively reflect on the government in terms of promoting equality, thereby reinforcing social unity.
5855	Religion and lifestyle are a personal choice. If your religion or culture prevents gay marriage, that’s fine — it means you don’t want to marry a person of the same gender. However, that shouldn’t extend to other religions or cultures. Gay couples marrying does not in any way affect the marriage between the opposite genders; couples can still marry and get on with their lives.
5856	Marriage should be celebrated by all couples, regardless of their religion, culture or sexual orientation. Everyone should have the right to marry and lead a happy life with their partner. While each individual’s beliefs and attitudes towards same-sex marriage may differ, it does not infringe on anyone else’s right to marry. Therefore, people should be allowed to make these decisions according to their own values.
5857	Gay marriage should be respected as it is a matter of personal choice; some religions or cultures may not allow it, but this does not extend to other faiths or cultures. It does not affect marriage to the opposite gender, as couples can marry and go on with their lives as usual.
5858	Marriage is a deeply personal decision and some religions or cultures may not allow same-sex marriage. However, this does not extend to other religions or cultures, and gay people should still be allowed to marry. This does not affect the marriage between two different genders and should be accepted, just as with heterosexual couples.
5859	Religion and lifestyle choices are personal decisions that should be respected. If a person's religion or culture doesn't allow gay marriage, that's fine. It means they don't want to marry someone of the same gender. However, that decision should not extend to other religions or cultures. Same-sex couples marrying should not affect opposite-gender marriages in any way; they are simply allowed to marry and go on with their lives.
5860	I believe that pursuing personal growth is preferable, as in order to help others, you need to help yourself first. Additionally, if you are happy and successful in life, you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, if someone wants to succeed in life, they may use that success to aid others financially.
5861	I believe that pursuing personal goals can be beneficial as it enables you to help others while also satisfying yourself. For example, if someone wants to be successful in life, they can achieve this and then choose to help others with the money they have. This allows them to satisfy their own needs while also aiding the outside world.
5862	I believe that personal growth is important as it allows you to help others while also satisfying yourself. If you are happy and successful in life, you are more likely to help others as well as achieve your goals. Additionally, if you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world, this can serve as motivation to succeed.
5863	I believe that personal growth is more beneficial as it enables you to help yourself first. In addition, if you are happy and confident in your pursuits, you are better able to assist the outside world. For instance, if someone wants to achieve success in life, they can use their resources to help others.
5864	I believe that pursuing personal goals is more effective, as in order to help others, you must first help yourself. I also think that if you are happy and confident in life, you can satisfy your needs while also helping the outside world. For instance, if someone is successful and financially stable, they may decide to help others.
5865	I believe that pursuing something personally is the best route for me, as I am more inclined to focus on what benefits my life. However, I do have my giving moments, so it depends on my current feelings.
5866	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me as I am more focused on developing myself and my own life. I still have my giving moments, however, so it depends on my current state of mind.
5867	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me as I prefer to invest in something that will benefit my life. However, I do have my giving moments, so it depends on how I feel at the moment.
5868	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me, as I am more interested in investing in something that will improve my life. However, I do have my giving moments, so it depends on how I am feeling at the time.
5869	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I am more interested in something that will improve my life. Although I do have giving moments, I currently prefer to focus on something that improves my life situation.
5870	I believe the defendant is innocent of the crime he was convicted of, as the evidence presented at trial did not definitively prove his guilt. However, the court’s decision was made with convincing evidence and I believe the defendant should be held accountable for the crime and should be required to pay restitution.
5871	I believe that the conviction of the older man for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend was sound and that he was rightly found guilty. However, I think the court ruling may have traumatized him mentally and financially, as evidenced by his book to generate income. I believe that any profits from the book should be used to help him pay the restitution he owes.
5872	I do not believe that the accused killed his ex-wife and her friend. However, the book is an attempt to convince the public that he is innocent, which could be difficult given the evidence against him. I believe the court should impose a restitution order to ensure he pays any fines or compensation ordered by the court.
5873	I do not believe that the accused killled his ex-wife and her friend. However, the book is an attempt to convince the public that he is innocent, despite the court's decision. It is possible that the funds from the book and other sources should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
5874	I believe the court took the right approach by convicting him, as I think there is enough evidence to suggest he was guilty. However, I think the amount of restitution he must pay should be reduced to account for his financial situation, while taking into consideration the losses his victims' families have suffered.
5875	1) The First Amendment to the Bill of Rights provides essential protection for speech and press, as well as the right of people to assemble peacefully and petition the government. The Supreme Court has recognized that speech is included within the Amendment's protection.   2) The legality of desecrating the American flag was recently made illegal by the House, although it is still awaiting further approval from the legal system.
5876	1) The First Amendment to the Constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression.  It states that Congress may not make any laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  Desecration of the U.S. flag is still legal, as recently (2005) the House passed a law making it illegal.  This law is pending approval through the legal system.   2)  The First Amendment to the Constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression.  It states that Congress may not make any laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
5877	1) The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to freedom of speech and expression. Congress may not interfere with the right to practice any religion, or impose limits on the exercise of these rights. It also prevents laws that abridge the freedom of the press.  Thus, the government cannot legally impede any of these rights.  2) Although recently, the House passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the American flag, this law is still pending approval through the legal system.
5878	1)  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression.  It states that Congress may notpass laws prohibiting the establishment of religion, or restrict the right to peacefully assemble or petition the government.  Thus, speech is allowed to occur without interference from the government.   2)  Congress recently passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the American flag.  This law is still being reviewed by the legal system.
5879	1) The First Amendment of the Bill of Rights protects freedom of speech and press, which includes the right to express one's beliefs without interference from the government. Congress may not interfere with the right to peacefully assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.    2) The legality of desecration of the U.S. flag is still an issue in the legal system. The House passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the American flag in 2005, but it is yet to be fully approved by the system.
5880	In the US, approximately 30,000 people die each year due to not wearing a seat belt, while 10,000 people die each year due to wearing a seat belt. The government has the authority to enforce laws and issue fines to ensure safety on the roads.
5881	On the radio today, it was stated that in the US, on average, 30,000 people die each year due to not wearing a seatbelt, while approximately 10,000 die each year due to wearing a seatbelt. It is my opinion that this can be a matter of personal choice, but I understand that fines are becoming stricter in regards to seatbelt usage.
5882	On the radio today, it was reported that, on average in the US, around 30,000 people die each year due to not wearing a seat belt, while approximately 10,000 people die each year due to wearing a seat belt. It is my opinion that this can have a significant effect on one's personal freedom and that the government is beginning to implement stricter fines for such offences.
5883	The argument suggests that wearing a seat belt can save lives, as it can reduce the risk of death in an accident by 45-50%. This is true in the US, where it is estimated that around 30,000 people die each year due to not wearing a seat belt, while approximately 10,000 deaths occur due to people wearing a seat belt. It is thus stated that wearing a seat belt can save lives, although it can still result in financial costs and loss of freedom if a fine is imposed.
5884	According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, wearing a seat belt is estimated to save approximately 14,000 lives each year in the US. Wearing a seat belt can significantly reduce the risk of fatalities in a car accident. However, not wearing a seat belt can increase the risk of death significantly.
5885	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school.  You wouldn't attend these schools unless you were a Scientologist though, thankfully.  Scientology has grown in visibility in society through its various front groups, such as Narconon, which provide services to the community.
5886	Scientology has gradually become more visible in society through front groups, such as Narconon, which offer services to the community. While these groups do not advertise their affiliation with Scientology, it is possible that if heard of Scientology being taught in schools, it is run by Scientologists.
5887	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school.  You would not necessarily need to attend these schools if you were a Scientologist, as Scientology has slowly integrated into society through various front groups such as Narconon. These groups usually do not advertise their links to Scientologists, so it is possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in a particular school, it is definitely run by Scientologists.
5888	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school.  You would not necessarily have to attend these schools if you were a Scientologist, but Scientology has slowly seeped into society through various front groups, such as Narconon, which provide services to the community.
5889	Scientology has grown increasingly more visible in society over time through various front groups that offer services to the community, such as Narconon. While this may make Scientology more visible in society, it is still possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in a school, it would be run by Scientologists, as these groups typically do not advertise their affiliation with the religion.
5890	I have worked with a few different local police departments, and I trust them all.  Here in my city, I feel that the officers are very respectful and caring, and they strive to do the best they can for the community.  The police chief is great and supports his officers.  We have not had many issues of officers leaving.
5891	I work with a few different local police departments and I trust all of them. I have a positive experience with the police in my city; the officers are respectful and caring, and the chief is supportive of his officers. I feel safe in my community due to their efforts.
5892	Yes. I work with a few different local police departments and I trust all of them. As for the city I live in, I do, very much. There are some great officers there and they are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and backs his officers. We haven't had any major issues with police departures.
5893	I have worked with a few local police departments and I have a high level of trust for them. I have a positive impression of the officers in my city; they are professional and caring, and the chief backs them. The officers in the city I live in generally stay and work together with the community.
5894	Yes. I have worked with a few different local police departments and I trust all of them. As for the city I live in, I do, very much. There are some great officers there and they are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and backs his officers. We don't have a lot of turnover between departments.
5895	I understand your anger and frustration, but it is important to remain calm and take action in order to protect your rights. I suggest that you document the incident, reach out to the authorities and contact a lawyer to discuss your options. Filing a complaint with the U.S. Attorney General, the FBI and local police chief is a good first step to protect your rights. Additionally, connecting with local media outlets could help increase awareness of the situation.
5896	The officer and the business owner have both violated your right to freedom of speech, and I would take action to protect that right. I would immediately file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the FBI, and local police chief. I would also contact local media outlets to get my story out.   In cases of egregious violations of civil rights, I would file a civil lawsuit against the officer and the business owner in order to hold them accountable and make sure that justice is served.   I believe that filing complaints and lawsuits is the best way to ensure that the perpetrators are held accountable and made to pay for their actions.
5897	I would file a complaint with the local police chief, the U.S. Attorney General’s Office, and the FBI, in addition to contacting media outlets. I would also consider filing a civil lawsuit against the officer and the business owner. While I have the legal recourse available to me, I will not back down from this violation of my rights.
5898	The officer and the business owner have both violated your rights to freedom of speech. I would immediately file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney Generals office, The F.B.I., and the local police chief. I would also contact local media outlets to spread the story. If I had the funds, I would also consider filing a civil lawsuit against both the officer and the business owner. It is essential that we stand up for our rights and make sure that this sort of behavior by law enforcement does not occur again.
5899	The officer and the business owner have both violated your right to freedom of speech. I would immediately file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney General, the FBI, and local police chief, as well as contact local media outlets. I would also consider filing a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. While this experience is difficult to go through, you do have legal recourse. I have won lawsuits against police officers before, and I am only 21 years old. We must take action to ensure that laws are upheld.
5900	I believe that imprisoning convicted terrorists is the best way to keep our society safe from terrorist threats. Prisons provide security measures and restricted access to inmates, which can help prevent terrorists from committing additional acts of violence. In addition, incarcerating terrorists may reduce their ability to plan and orchestrate further attacks.
5901	I believe that life imprisonment is the most suitable punishment as it removes the convicted terrorist from society and keeps them from committing further crimes. Furthermore, if the terrorist is sent to a supermax prison, the guards are likely to take appropriate action to prevent any violence from occurring.
5902	I think keeping convicted terrorists separate from the general population could help minimize the risk of them committing further crimes or tampering with other inmates. It could also reduce the stress of being in prison for them, which could make it easier for them to integrate into the prison environment.
5903	I believe that life in prison, even in a supermax facility, is a suitable punishment for these criminals. It will likely deter future acts of terrorism, as inmates in these facilities are isolated from the general population and are subject to stricter security measures.
5904	I believe that sentencing perpetrators of violent crimes to life in prison is an appropriate punishment, as this would ensure that they are unable to commit any further offences. Furthermore, isolating them in our worst supermax prison would keep them away from general population, while allowing guards to monitor any potential risks.
5905	Yes, this is a challenge in international law, as there is no single authority that can enforce international law and hold countries accountable. This can lead to unequal treatment of countries, as seen in the example of Israel and the occupied Palestinian lands. Factors such as military strength and political alliances can play a role in whether a country is forced to leave another's territory. This highlights the limitations of international law and the need for better measures to ensure equality among nations.
5906	It happens in many countries, even those with less economic and political power are held accountable. For example, Israel was found to be in breach of international law for its occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967. While this was challenged by the international community, Israel was not militarily forced out, as would have happened in other cases, such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. This indicates that there are some limits to the enforcement of international law, which is often driven by the power of the countries involved.
5907	Israel has faced international sanction for its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and has been required to pull back its settlements in order to maintain peace in the region. While the US has not used its veto power to protect Israel, it has acted as a mediator in order to prevent further escalation of the conflict. In terms of other countries, there have been instances where the international community has intervened to remove occupying forces, such as in Kuwait.
5908	It happens all over the world, even bad countries are not held accountable in every instance. In some cases, certain countries have been given more leeway due to their economic and military power. This can lead to an uneven application of the law, which is a challenge that the international community faces.
5909	It happens all over the world, even bad countries are not always held accountable. For example, Israel has been occupying Palestinian lands since 1967, which has been tolerated by the international community, due to its military power and the protection offered by the US, as happened with Iraq when it invaded Kuwait. Hence, justice is not always served equally.
5910	I would want the person responsible to be held accountable if a loved one was killed. If it meant going to the gas chamber or lethal injection, that would be preferable to me in order to make sure it cannot happen to anyone else.
5911	I would want the person responsible to pay if someone in my family was killed, as I believe that justice should be served. If it came to the death penalty, either through the gas chamber or lethal injection, then that is a sacrifice I would make to ensure it does not happen to anyone else.
5912	If someone in my family had been killed, I would want the person responsible to be punished. I believe in eye for an eye, so if that means death by gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. At least that justice will be served and the person can no longer pose a threat to anyone else.
5913	If someone in my family had been killed, I would want the person responsible to be held accountable. If a prison sentence is deemed necessary, I would prefer the death penalty to be an option as an alternative to imprisonment. While this may not bring my loved one back, I would get some sense of justice.
5914	I would want the person responsible to be held accountable if someone in my family was killed. Depending on the circumstances, I would prefer either the gas chamber or lethal injection as punishment to ensure that the person could not commit similar crimes again. While it would not bring back the loved one, I would still have some closure.
5915	Lets see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, which makes him dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006; unless one of them can time travel, it is impossible for them to be the same in terms of their physical age.
5916	Let us consider President Bush and Hitler. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006, while Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, making him dead. Therefore, it is impossible for them to be the same person, as conditions for one existence have to be similar for two people to be the same age.
5917	It is impossible for us to know for sure the exact circumstances surrounding Hitler's death, as it was more than 70 years ago. Similarly, President Bush's current whereabouts and health are unknown and may remain so, although it is known that he is alive. Therefore, it is impossible to determine with certainty the physical location and well-being of either individual at this time.
5918	Let us see:  Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, which means he was dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006, unless one of them can time travel, which makes it impossible for them to be the same. I understand the concept of time difference between them.
5919	Lets see  Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, which makes him dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006; unless one of them can time travel, it is impossible for them to be the same in terms of chronology.
5920	In most cases, the police do not have the right to enter a person's home or property without a warrant. However, there are some exceptions, such as a call from home or domestic violence. Generally, it is unlikely that the police will be able to enter a person's property without a court order, so it is advisable to be aware of this and take the necessary steps.
5921	Regarding the property, if it's in your home, the police cannot enter without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. This makes it difficult for them to gain access to the property without a court order, so it is best to take precautions to secure the property.   Generally speaking, the police require a warrant to enter a home in the majority of cases. However, there may be exceptions for responding to a call from home or domestic violence.
5922	Regarding the property, if it’s in your home, the police generally need a warrant to enter and seize property. Since it is unlikely the police would fabricate a complaint, it is unlikely that they would be able to take the property without a court order.  In general, the police usually need a warrant to enter a residence or property unless there is an emergency or domestic violence.  It is best to consult a local attorney for further advice regarding the situation.
5923	Regarding the property, if it’s in your home, the police cannot enter without a warrant or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. However, this is unlikely to happen, so you should not worry too much about the property. Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home without a warrant in the majority of cases.
5924	Regarding the property, if it is in your home, the police generally need a warrant to enter the premises. Since this is unlikely to happen, it is recommended to keep the property safe.
5925	Yes, legality of abortion should be decided on an individual basis, as it is a highly personal and emotional decision. However, from a societal perspective, access to birth control and education about the potential consequences of sex can help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. In this way, we can limit the number of abortions that occur.
5926	Yes, it is important to consider the wishes of prospective parents and the rights of the child in these decisions, particularly when it comes to reproductive rights. While some countries have laws allowing abortion in certain cases, it is important to keep in mind that abortion can have negative physical and mental health implications for women.
5927	Yes, there is definitely a balance to be reached between the rights of an individual and the larger population. If self-control is practiced and laws are in place to enforce it, there would be less trouble with these issues. Although abortion is legal in some cases, it is not necessarily the best choice for a woman's health.
5928	Yes, access to birth control and family planning is important in order to reduce unwanted pregnancies, however, it is also important to recognize that abortion is not a completely risk-free procedure from a woman's health standpoint. In addition, it is important to recognize that a woman's right to make decisions about her body is paramount, and her right to access safe and effective family planning options should be available if she so chooses.
5929	Yes, the government should have some say in the matter, as there are many issues associated with population control that need to be addressed, such as access to contraceptives and education on family planning. This can help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and make abortion less necessary.
5930	At 12 years old, children are generally aware of the consequences of their actions, although these consequences may not be immediately apparent. There have been cases in the US of murder committed by 12 and 13 year olds, which should be addressed by the legal system in addition to punishment.
5931	If the minor is under 12 years old, I would say no, as children this age are usually not capable of fully understanding the consequences of their actions. However, at 12 years old, I believe the child is aware of the consequences of their actions and can make informed decisions. In cases such as these, I believe the minor should be tried as an adult and punished accordingly.
5932	If the minor is under 12 years old, I would say no, as I believe children this age are not fully aware of the consequences of their actions. However, at age 12, I believe children are cognitively able to understand the consequences of their actions and to be held accountable for them. I believe that both the minor's actions and the effects of them should be taken into consideration when deciding on the punishment.
5933	If the minor is under 12 years old, I would say no. However, by the time a child reaches the age of 12, they are usually aware of the consequences of their actions and the effects these have on their environment. Thus, I believe they should be treated as an adult and punished accordingly.
5934	If the minor is under 12 years old, I would say no. However, at 12 years old, the child is usually aware of what they are doing and the effects of their actions. I believe that children of this age should be tried and punished as an adult.
5935	The Democratic Party has pushed for greater acceptance of drugs and alcohol in society, arguing that it should be legalized to some extent in order to allow people to make their own decisions regarding use. While some states have legalized marijuana in specific cases, the legalization of drugs or alcohol at a national level is still a long way off, and it is likely that this will remain the case. This is partially due to the opposition from conservative groups, who argue that allowing drugs or alcohol to be more widely available could lead to an increase in abuse and associated issues.
5936	The liberal Democratic party has sought to decriminalize drugs and alcohol in certain cases, arguing that this could help reduce the harm associated with their use. However, they would immediately challenge any such changes in law, claiming that it is unconstitutional. I have heard that they removed religious symbols from schools as it was considered inconsistent with the school curriculum.
5937	The Democrats have often attempted to restrict certain freedoms in order to protect people from what they perceive to be harm. For example, certain states have removed religious symbols such as crosses from public school classrooms, arguing that it could create a religous environment that goes against the separation of church and state. However, they have also taken out displays of George Washington praying from schools, claiming it was unconstitutional. Similarly, they have removed Christian symbols from the classroom while allowing other religions such as Hinduism and Judaism to be taught. This is wrong; we should be able to teach all aspects of history and religion in our schools, regardless of our own beliefs.
5938	The liberal Democrats have made it acceptable to do many of these things. If, in some way, drugs or alcohol were made illegal, they would IMMEDIATELY challenge that the law is “unconstitutional”. I heard that they took out the picture of George Washington praying from a school because they said that it was “unconstitutional”. Our Founding Father’s faith is indeed an important part of our nation’s history, yet we often water down the teaching of Christian values in schools, while we teach the children about other religions such as Hinduism and Judaism. This is highly skewed and hypocritical. Moreover, instead of trying to keep children away from sex, they are handing out condoms and encouraging ‘safe sex’, which is a twisted way of looking at it.
5939	The liberal Democrats have pushed for greater acceptance of drugs and alcohol, arguing that it is better for society to educate people on the dangers of these substances rather than completely prohibit their use. However, when it comes to religion, the government is often more likely to ban educational resources or restrict religious expression in schools. This can create a conflict between the values of the school and those of the parents.
5940	First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that specialized in liquor license litigation.  It is possible for law enforcement to send decoys into a liquor store to attempt to purchase alcohol from the clerk; however, it would not be entrapment if the decoy merely says “no” to the clerk and the clerk still gives in. The test is whether the clerk was predisposed to commit the crime—if the clerk is already inclined to do so, it is not entrapment.
5941	First, my expertise.  I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation.  While my experience is primarily in this area, I am familiar with some relevant issues that come up in liquor license law.  I believe that my knowledge and understanding of these issues allows me to provide a meaningful contribution to the discussion.
5942	First, my expertise.  I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation.  In my experience, it is not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell alcohol to them.  It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to them.  The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.  If the decoy just says to the clerk, “Oh, come on!” and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it is not entrapment.
5943	First, my expertise. I am a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that specialized in liquor license litigation.  It is not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell alcohol. The test is whether the clerk was predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy merely says “Oh, come on!” and the clerk then goes ahead and sells the alcohol, it is not entrapment.
5944	My expertise lies in liquor license litigation; I used to work for a firm that specialized in this area of law. It is not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to test whether a clerk will sell alcohol to minors. It would only be entrapment if the decoy used extraordinary measures to convince the clerk to sell alcohol. The key consideration is whether the clerk was predisposed to commit the crime; if the decoy just says “no” and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime, and it is not entrapment.
5945	Yes, in order to serve on a jury, one must have the capacity to make an objective decision based on the evidence. This requires an greater level of experience and maturity which is typically only found in adults.
5946	No. Teens, in general, lack the mature decision-making capabilities necessary to make objective judgments in court cases, as these decisions must take into account evidence as well as emotions. More life experience and maturity is required in such cases.
5947	No. Teens typically lack the mature decision-making capabilities necessary to make objective judgments in court cases, as such decisions must be based on evidence and an individual's emotions should not be taken into account. Life experience and maturity are required for such decisions to be made.
5948	It is understandable that teens may not have the same level of objectivity and maturity as adults when deciding a case due to insufficient life experience. However, being an adult does not guarantee one has more mature thoughts as decision making in a court case requires a more thorough consideration of the evidence.
5949	No. Teens, in general, do not have the mature decision-making capabilities necessary to make objective judgements in court cases, as such decisions require an understanding of the evidence as well as an individual's emotions. More life experience and maturity is needed in such cases.
5950	If that was the entire story, then that outcome is completely unjustified. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. Touching a ‘bad’ place could lead to a crime, which was not the case here. The parents should have been taught about teaching their daughter safe habits, the daughter should have been taught about avoiding dangerous situations, and the man should have been advised to be more aware in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazy society. That way, a tragedy can be avoided in the future.
5951	If the child touching the man's shoulder was the only issue, then the outcome was not accurate. Touching another person can be within the boundaries of acceptable behavior, depending on the context. However, if the man was concerned that the child might touch a “bad” place, it is understandable that he would be cautious, especially if the child was in a public area.   The parents should have been taught that touching can be acceptable in certain situations, while talking to the child and teaching them about safety could have also been done. Both the child and the parent could have been warned about potential dangers in public places.   In conclusion, the outcome of the situation could have been handled better to ensure the safety of the child while also educating the parents.
5952	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a “bad” place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply does not make any sense at all.  It is understandable to require such registration if a conviction is obtained, but requiring such registration without a conviction can cause unnecessary trauma and stigma for the individual and their family, which goes against the principle of presuming innocence until proven guilty.
5953	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a “bad” place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn’t make any sense at all.  While the parent's actions may have been appropriate, the government overreacted and blew the situation out of proportion. The consequence of that was the man being labeled a sex offender even though he had not committed a crime.
5954	If that is the entire story then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NOTHING wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. However, there are some places which it is not advisable to touch, such as the head, as this could be seen as invasive. This was not an issue in the street as it was, but it could have been in other situations. This is why it is important to be aware of social cues and respect boundaries.   What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our society, where we need to be mindful of potential risks and dangers. This could have been avoided by being more aware and cautious, while still allowing the daughter to be able to run and explore.    And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? This largely depends on the jurisdictions, but in some countries, registration is required for any crime that involves a sexual offence or a crime committed with a minor. This is done to protect the public and ensure public safety.
5955	Oh please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit.  The chances of getting marijuana legalized are still slim, as legislation around it is gradually changing. Governments are increasingly introducing restrictions on where smoking is allowed, as well as regulating how it is prepared and what can be said in this regard. In essence, we are living in a ‘nanny state’ where our freedoms are increasingly curtailed.
5956	While the possibility of marijuana being legalized in the future is uncertain, the current laws restricting its use remain in place. The government is also increasingly regulating activities such as smoking, cooking and what people can say in order to ensure public safety.
5957	It is unlikely that marijuana will be legalized in the near future due to the current regulations in place. Restrictions are in place to control the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, as well as what people can say and do. Although this may seem controlling, it is done to ensure public safety and well-being.
5958	Oh please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this pursuit.  The legalization of marijuana is not likely to happen soon, as laws and regulations regarding its use are still being established. Additionally, laws restricting smoking, ingredients, and consumption have been implemented to ensure public safety. We are in a ‘nanny state’ where control over every aspect of our lives is regulated for our own good.
5959	Oh please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit.  The chances of getting marijuana legalized are currently quite slim, especially in the current regulatory environment, where the use and sale of marijuana is highly restricted in many states. Furthermore, regulations regarding the preparation and consumption of marijuana as well as where it can be used are increasingly more restrictive.
5960	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start, that would be his baseline. I measures changes over time. Extreme nervousness could cause him to fail, even if his English was not par. Have him volunteer for another polygraph test from a different examiner, in order to get a more accurate reading.
5961	Polygraphs use a baseline and measure changes from it; if your friend was nervous from the start, that would be his baseline. Although it may affect his score, these changes would likely need to be extreme to cause failure. Additionally, his English proficiency should not affect the results of the polygraph. Volunteering for another polygraph from a different reader could be beneficial.
5962	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start, this could affect his results, as it would be based on his initial reactions. I measures changes in reactions, rather than overall results. Extreme reactions could cause him to fail. English proficiency should not have any effect on the results. Consider having him take another polygraph test from a different reader to get a clearer reading.
5963	Polygraphs use a baseline and compare the subject's responses to it; if your friend was nervous from the start, this could affect his results, even if his English was not up to par. It is best to have him volunteer for another polygraph test from a different reader in order to get a clearer result.
5964	Polygraphs use a baseline and measure changes from that baseline. If your friend was nervous from the start, this could affect his results, even if his English was not up to par. Another polygraph reader may provide better results. It is best to have him volunteer for another polygraph test from a different reader.
5965	Affirmative action is necessary in certain situations to provide equal opportunity to minorities, despite the existence of discrimination. Although there have been strides made in terms of civil rights, discrimination still exists. This is why such policies are necessary to provide an even playing field.
5966	Affirmative action is intended to increase opportunities for historically marginalized groups by providing equal access to education and employment. While this policy has increased access for some groups, there is still much work to be done to ensure equal opportunity. The playing field is not yet level, and discrimination still exists.
5967	Affirmative action can be beneficial in certain cases to ensure equality, despite the fact that discrimination still exists. While there have been significant improvements for African Americans and other minorities compared to the past, discrimination still exists, making it necessary to have such policies in place.
5968	Affirmative action is designed to address the persistent inequality that still exists in our society, especially in terms of access to educational and employment opportunities. While there has been progress made in terms of civil rights, there is still a great deal of discrimination that exists. Unfortunately, affirmative action policies are necessary to try and level the playing field.
5969	I believe that affirmative action is necessary in some cases to level the playing field, despite the fact that discrimination still exists. Although there have been strides made for minority groups, true equality is still a long way off. Moreover, policies that implement affirmative action provide some relief in an imperfect world, but this is only possible in a society free from discrimination.
5970	Get a job.  Your ex has a child or children to support.  How do they expect to do this without a job? It is important that they have access to a stable source of income in order to provide for their children, and this should be their responsibility.  GET A JOB!
5971	Get a job. Your ex has a child or children to support. In order for them to do this, they need to earn an income. That income can come from a job or other sources such as government aid or child support. It is important for your ex to be able to support their children, and you should both share the responsibility of this.
5972	Get a job.  Your ex has a child or children to support.  How do you expect them to do it and why should they carry your responsibility for it as well?  It is important to note that while raising children is a shared responsibility, it is generally the parent's responsibility to provide financial support for their children. This means that, if financially able, parents should provide for their children's needs even if they are not the custodial parent.
5973	Get a job.  Your ex has a child or children to support.  In order for your ex to do this, they need to have a source of income. It is important to realize that having a job can provide stability and financial security for both the parent and the children, and you should both share responsibility for providing for the family.
5974	Get a job.  Your ex has a child or children to support.  How do you expect them to do it and why should they carry your responsibility for it alone? It is important that you take responsibility for your share of childcare and financial support. Working to support your children is important for the stability of their home life and for their future.
5975	What difference would there be? Nonviolent offenders may be released from prison in order to make room for violent offenders, such as murderers and rapists, who present a greater risk to society. This enables prison space to be used to protect society from violent offenders.
5976	What difference would there be? Nonviolent offenders will continue to be released back into society to make room for violent offenders like murderers and rapists, who present a greater risk to public safety. Prison should be utilized for long-term incarceration of serious offenders such as drug dealers, robbers, and gang members, in order to protect society from these risks.
5977	The primary purpose of prison is to protect society from those individuals who have committed violent crimes, such as murderers and rapists, as well as those who pose a threat of future violence. Incarceration is necessary in order to prevent these individuals from harming others and to ensure public safety. Prisons should also be used to incarcerate those who are deemed a risk to society, such as dangerous drug offenders and repeat offenders of other crimes.
5978	What difference would there be? Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders such as shoplifters and drug users, who pose less of a risk to the community. Prisons should be for the long-term incarineement of major drug dealers, robbers, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
5979	What difference would there be? Nonviolent offenders can still be released from prison in order to make room for more serious offenders, such as violent criminals who pose a greater risk to society. Prisons should be used to incarcerate serious offenders, such as rapists and murderers, in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
5980	It is difficult to determine how to handle drug-related crime without access to the full details of the case, but generally speaking, a judge may impose a jail term along with a drug rehabilitation program. Depending on the crime and prior records of the accused, a sentence of 3 to 5 years could be imposed, although time in rehab could reduce this. Good behavior could reduce the sentence length.
5981	The use of drugs can lead to criminal activity, which could include convictions for prior offenses. To address this, a combination of jail time and drug rehabilitation programs could be used, with the length of sentence and good behavior being factors that influence the length of the sentence.  I suggest a sentence of 3 to 5 years.
5982	If drugs are involved, it could lead to crime, which could then lead to a criminal record. To address this, I would suggest a prison sentence ranging from 3 to 5 years, depending on the crime and good behavior.
5983	Under the use of drugs, a crime may occur, which can include prior offenses. It is then appropriate to sentence an individual to both jail time and a drug rehabilitation program, depending on the severity of the crime and the individual's criminal history.  I would suggest a sentence of 3 to 5 years, depending on good behavior.
5984	The legal system should take into account previous criminal record and drug usage when determining the sentence for a drug-related crime. A combination of jail time and drug rehabilitation programs can be effective in addressing the crime and providing rehabilitation. Generally, a sentence of three to five years should be imposed, with the possibility of reduction for good behavior.
5985	What are their choices?  Either they comply with China’s rules and regulations, or they offer nothing to the people of China.  It is better to sacrifice and be seen than to be eliminated.  People might not realize how much freedom they enjoy compared to the people of China.
5986	What are their options? Either they comply with Chinese regulations or offer no services to the people in China. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people in China if the government blocks and removes content. In many cases, countries like China place more restrictions on services than they do in their own country. People often perceive their freedoms to be more limited than those in China.
5987	What are their choices? Either they comply with China’s rules and regulations or they offer nothing to the people of China. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people of China if the government blocks and removes content. It is better to sacrifice some freedom in order to maintain access to the internet.
5988	What are their choices? Either they comply with China's rules and regulations or they offer nothing to the people of China. There is no guarantee that these actions will improve conditions; it is better to take these risks in order to stay in the competition than to sacrifice everything and be eliminated. Additionally, people have no idea what freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
5989	What are their choices? Either they comply with Chinese regulations or offer nothing to the people of China. While this may reduce their reach in these areas, it is better than sacrificing the benefits they offer and being eliminated. Furthermore, people cannot be sure of the freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
5990	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during these years that children transition from concrete to more rational thinking. This is why some subjects may not be introduced until children are older.    Sixteen-year-old are cognitively more advanced than children aged 13 in every respect.
5991	I agree with parts of both answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during these years that children transition from concrete thinking to more rational thinking. This can make it difficult for younger children to understand cause and effect, or to understand the consequences of their actions. 16 year olds are cognitively far ahead of 13 year olds in every respect.
5992	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during these years that children transition from concrete to more abstract thinking. This can make it difficult for younger children to understand cause and effect, or understand the consequences of their actions.
5993	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during these years that children transition from concrete to rational thinking. This can make it difficult for younger children to understand cause and effect, or the consequences of their actions. 13-year-olds have more developed cognitive abilities than younger children.
5994	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during these years that children transition from concrete to rational thinking. This can make it more difficult for younger children to understand the consequences of their actions or to understand the difference between right and wrong.
5995	Well, for one thing, Walmart has a lower rating in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise. They are not like Costco at all.
5996	Well, for one thing, Wal-Mart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. This has led me to avoid shopping there and encourage others to do the same. They are not comparable to Costco in terms of their operations or employee policies.
5997	Wal-Mart has a less than stellar record for treating its employees fairly, which has caused me to avoid shopping there. I understand that this may put pressure on the stores to keep prices down, but I believe that California would be better off if its citizens were able to access better working conditions and wages.
5998	Wal-Mart has been found to have some of the worst employee rating in terms of working conditions and benefits. This has led me to boycott them and encourage others to do the same. They are not comparable to Costco, which offers better working conditions and benefits for its employees. I believe that California would be better off without them.
5999	Well, for one thing, Wal-Mart has one of the worst ratings in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise.  I understand their strategy can be better in some states than others, but I still believe there are better options out there.
6000	First off, you get what you pay for and secondly, if it seems too good to be true then it probably is. I would recommend going up to COMP and COLLISION cover, as this offers more comprehensive protection in the event of a claim.  I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, to review it carefully. This will spell out what is and isn’t covered by the policy. If you are comfortable with the coverage, then yes, go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy could be charged back to the insured.
6001	Firstly, you get what you pay for, so it is important to ensure that you are purchasing the appropriate level of cover. Furthermore, if something seems too good to be true, it is important to research the policy further to ensure that you are aware of what is and is not covered. I would suggest obtaining a copy of the policy, called a specimen policy, and thoroughly reviewing it. This will provide you with more information and allow you to make an informed decision.
6002	First off, you get what you pay for and secondly, if it seems to good to be true then it probably is. I would bump up to COMP and COLLISION as well in my opinion. I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, and comb through it very carefully. It will spell out what you will and won't be getting in the policy. If you are comfortable then yes, go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy  in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people lives ruined by not having enough or the RIGHT TYPE of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
6003	First off, you get what you pay for, so it is important to research the policy and ensure that it meets your needs and provides the coverage you require. Secondly, if the policy seems too good to be true, it may be worth considering a higher level of coverage. As insurance is designed to provide financial protection in the event of a loss, it is important to review the policy closely and ensure that it meets your needs. If you are comfortable, then yes, go for it. Be advised, any risks and costs associated with an incident may be charged back to you, so it is important to understand the policy’s terms and conditions.
6004	I understand the concern that a cheaper policy may not cover all losses, which could be costly. However, I would consider the coverage offered, the limits of the policy, and the additional costs that may be incurred if an event is not covered. This can be checked by asking the agent for a specimen policy that outlines what is and is not covered.
6005	Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons. While regulated industries with screening and safety measures could potentially be safer than the current environment, societal views still play a role in making these services more accepted. This makes it difficult for governments to fully legalize such services.
6006	Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons.  There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands.  Governments are reluctant to officially approve of sex work due to social stigma, even though it could be safer in terms of health risks than the current industry.
6007	Well, it's certainly not going away anytime soon is it?  While governments around the world are increasingly becoming more accepting of legalized prostitution, it is still heavily regulated in many countries and the idea of it being legalised remains controversial among many people.  From a moral standpoint, governments are more likely to allow sex work to be legalised if there is strong public demand for it, as was the case in some countries that have now introduced laws allowing it.  While there are arguments made for legalised prostitution being safer than the current industry due to regulations such as mandatory check-ups, there remain reservations from some people about it being accepted.
6008	Yes, largely it's due to moral reasons. There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands.  Essentially, society as a whole is not yet ready to accept and accept the idea of sex work as an occupation, even though it is legal in many countries. This is largely due to the perceived stigma associated with it.
6009	Yes, primarily it's due to moral reasons. There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands.  In terms of acceptance, people generally feel that it's not ideal to have sex for pay in society, though it may be increasingly accepted in the future.
6010	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty in cases of murder as I believe the perpetrator should face the ultimate sanction. However, the rational part of me opposes the death penalty due to the risk of executing innocent people, as DNA testing is not always available in all cases. While DNA testing can provide some clarity, it is not a guarantee that innocent people will not be sentenced to death.
6011	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty, as I can understand why it would be desired in certain cases. However, the death penalty carries the risk of executing innocent people, which I oppose, as DNA tests are not always available to confirm guilt. In cases without DNA, appeals are less likely to be successful and individuals could face the death penalty.
6012	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty in some cases, as I recognize the importance of providing justice to families of victims. However, I oppose the death penalty as I believe there is a risk of innocent people being executed. DNA testing is not always available to ensure accuracy in all cases, which presents a risk of innocent people being sentenced to death.
6013	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty, as I believe it provides justice when someone takes a life. However, I recognize the risks associated with the death penalty, as DNA testing is not always available to prove innocence. Ultimately, I oppose it due to the risk of innocent people being executed.
6014	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty as I can understand why victims' families would want the person to face the ultimate punishment. However, the rational part of me opposes the death penalty as there is a risk of innocent people being killed. DNA testing is not always available to confirm guilt, which can lead to innocent people being sentenced to death.
6015	Drug use can be a psychological issue for some individuals, as it is often associated with an underlying mental illness. Studies have shown that people may use drugs as a form of self-medication for these issues. While this is the case, it is important to note that drug use may act as a way of hiding or avoiding the underlying problems, making treatment more complex and lengthy.
6016	Drug use can be a complex issue that is often driven by underlying mental health issues. Studies have shown that people who use drugs are often self-medicating for mental illnesses such as anxiety and panic disorders, which can make it more difficult to get help due to the stigma in society. While treatment can help address these issues, it often takes many years of therapy to do so.
6017	Drug use is often rooted in underlying mental health issues, such as anxiety and panic disorders, which can make it difficult to access treatment. It is important that people have the support they need to accept help and receive treatment.
6018	Drug use is often a psychological issue, with some studies suggesting that people may be self-medicating for mental illnesses such as anxiety and panic disorders. While this can be a difficult issue to tackle, therapists need to spend many years helping the individual deal with the drug use before they can even begin to address the cause. Society can be less sympathetic in these cases, though treatment is possible if the individual is willing to accept help.
6019	Drug use is often linked to mental health issues and can be an attempt to self-medicate such illnesses. For example, alcoholics are often found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. This can be difficult to address, as treatment must be provided first and foremost to address the drug use. Treatment does offer the potential for recovery, but only if the individual is willing to accept help.
6020	Yes. If you get caught later on, you'll potentially risk your job and could have to explain a gap in your employment history. To ensure success on the outside, it is important to maintain employment consistency, so it is best to avoid getting fired. Get a short-term job if necessary, and then find a better one. Ensure reliability especially at short-term jobs, as you don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
6021	Yes, it is important to make sure that you have an uninterrupted employment history so that you can make a successful return to the outside world. It may be necessary to take on a short-term job to build your experience and reliability, while keeping a consistent reference.
6022	Yes. If you get caught later, you may lose your job and will need to explain a gap in your employment history. To have a better chance of finding work, it is best to secure short-term jobs and make sure to be reliable, especially at these jobs. It is important to have references to build on. Good luck.
6023	Yes. If you get caught later, you could lose your job and may need to explain a gap in your employment history. To succeed on the outside, it is important to make sure you do not get fired. Consider getting a short-term job to establish reliability, and then move on to a better position. Make sure to be reliable at these jobs since references are important. It is essential to stay employed. Good luck.
6024	Yes, if you can find a job that will enable you to put the felony behind you, it is best to do so as soon as possible in order to maintain a consistent employment history. You should be reliable at short-term jobs to show you are reliable and can be trusted, as this can be beneficial when getting a new job.
6025	Yes, corporal punishment was legal in the US in the past, but the crime rate was lower overall. While this could be effective, the public backlash would be a problem. Ultimately, something must be done to tackle the issue.
6026	Ya know, corporal punishment was legal in the US up until the 1960s, when the crime rate was lower, the population was also lower due to fewer people living in the country. However, I believe corporal punishment could help reduce crime, but it would likely be met with opposition from the media and therefore would be ineffective. We need to find alternative solutions.
6027	Ya know, in the past corporal punishment was used in this country and the crime rate was lower, however the population was much smaller. I'm not sure that's a good idea, but something needs to be done. The crime rate is a problem, and I think corporal punishment could work. However, it would cause a media stir and be largely ineffective. We need a better solution.
6028	While corporal punishment was legal in the past, it is difficult to know for certain whether this had an effect on the crime rate. It is possible that corporal punishment could work, but it would likely generate a great deal of controversy and be ineffective. We need to look for more innovative solutions that have a lasting effect.
6029	In the past, corporal punishment was used in this country to reduce crime, and while that method may have been effective, it would cause an uproar due to modern societies sensibilities. While the crime rate is a concern, I believe that there needs to be a more effective solution than that.
6030	It is usually best to report any injuries to your supervisor, as this can help protect both your employer and yourself in the event of a injury. If you did not report the injury, it can be difficult to prove that it occurred at work, meaning that your employer may question the cause. This could lead to issues for both parties.
6031	In some workplaces, it is important to report any injuries, even minor ones, to ensure that the employer is aware of the injury. Without an incident report and verification by the employer, it can be difficult to prove that an injury occurred while on the job. This could result in a situation where the employee's job is in jeopardy, even if they were injured on the job.
6032	Your employer may argue that you should have reported the injury to them and completed an accident report, even if it occurred after work hours, as it could have affected your ability to perform your job duties. However, it is ultimately the company's decision whether or not to believe you. If it is proven that the injury happened after work hours, it may be difficult to prove that it occurred at work, meaning that you may not have a case.
6033	Although reporting an injury is typically required by law, it can be difficult to prove whether or not an injury occurred, especially if there is no physical evidence. It is possible that the employer may argue that the injury occurred outside of the workplace, which can be difficult to prove if there is no evidence. Ultimately, it may depend on the specific details of the case.
6034	The company may argue that the injury should have been reported to management or an injury report filled out, depending on the company’s policy. Without proof that the injury occurred at work, it can be difficult to make the case that the injury occurred at work.
6035	Dear Friend,   I agree that racial profiling by insurance companies would be subject to legal action; however, insurance companies can raise premiums based on certain factors such as driving records, location, and other factors that can lead to higher rates for certain customers.  This may create a financial hardship for some customers.  Insurance companies are able to set rates based on the risk they assess a customer presents.   I understand your point that discrimination by law enforcement can have much more severe consequences than discrimination by insurers, but insurance companies can still raise rates for certain customers.  This could lead to increased costs for some customers.
6036	Dear Friend,  I agree that law enforcement is a more pressing issue than insurance companies charging higher rates; however, I believe that courts could take action against insurance companies if they are found to be engaging in racial discrimination.  Insurance companies are also subject to regulation and legal action, which may limit their ability to set higher rates for certain minorities.  Thus, the threat of lawsuits may offer some protection against discrimination.  Overall, I believe that regulations and legal action can help to prevent racial discrimination by insurers.
6037	Dear Friend,  I agree that the risk of racial profiling should be considered when examining the issue of charging different groups of people different premiums. While insurance companies have the ability to charge different rates depending on the customer, this raises questions of fairness and potential discrimination. This is especially true when it comes to criminal justice, as laws and penalties can have a much greater impact on someone’s life.   Insurance companies should not be exempt from this consideration, as other companies could potentially offer insurance at lower prices. Ultimately, these decisions must be weighed carefully and be subject to regulation and government oversight.
6038	Dear Friend,   I believe that insurance companies should be able to set premiums based on individual risk, rather than relying on general assumptions about certain minority groups. Law enforcement can have a greater impact on an individual’s life, and thus I believe the potential for discrimination is greater in law enforcement than in insurance.  Insurance companies should be able to compete and offer insurance services to consumers.
6039	Dear Friend,  I agree that racial profiling by insurance companies is a concern, and it is likely that such practices would be challenged in court. However, law enforcement has greater power to impact the lives of individuals, making discrimination in law enforcement more concerning. Insurance companies are able to offer insurance to customers from multiple companies, while law enforcement prevents people from accessing certain services. This makes the potential for discrimination a concern.  While both are issues, law enforcement discrimination matters more.
6040	It seems possible that the landlord could have connections with law enforcement which could give him an advantage; however, there are steps that can be taken to try to combat this. Reporting him to the Better Business Bureau and the city for code violations is a possible option, as well as contacting the local news agency to expose him on national TV, which could lead to consequences such as his business licence being revoked. Additionally, documentary evidence should be collected to make the claims to HUD and the FBI.
6041	It is possible to report a landlord to the Better Business Bureau and local authorities if necessary, as well as contacting local news outlets to expose the situation. If the police and law enforcement are willing to work with the landlord, there are still steps that can be taken by the tenant to address the issue, such as contacting HUD and the FBI to document the situation.
6042	It seems like it, but NO.  No one is above the law.  If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations.  If necessary, contact the local news agency to expose him and his practices; this could cause him to lose his business licence or make changes to his practices. Additionally, if necessary, contact the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to document the issues and pursue legal action.
6043	It is possible that the landlord has connections with the police and other local authorities, which could make it more difficult to take action against him. However, there are still steps that can be taken. If the issues arise from code violations, then contacting the Better Business Bureau and local news agencies can help bring attention to the situation and potentially lead to action being taken. Additionally, contacting HUD and the FBI to document the claims could help make a difference.
6044	It is possible to take action by contacting the Better Business Bureau, local news agencies and government agencies such as the HUD and FBI to make sure the landlord is abiding by the law and to report any code violations. It is also possible to contact the local authorities to take action.
6045	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.  Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  So, if you don't show up in the suit, they can win a judgment.  However, if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought), it may be difficult for them to enforce the judgment.  This could be a problem if the court judgement is for US money.  However, it is still possible for them to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated, which could be complicated.
6046	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.  Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  However, if you are outside the US, it may be difficult for them to serve you with the lawsuit papers.  Generally, the court will allow service by publication, although this may vary depending on the state.  As such, it is possible for a judgment to be entered against you even if they cannot find you.  The court can also allow service by alternate means, such as through your contacts or attorneys.  Therefore, it is possible for them to obtain a judgment even if they cannot find you.  Nevertheless, you may still be able to challenge the judgment in some circumstances if you contest it.   So, in short, it is possible for them to obtain a judgment even if they cannot find you.  Generally, if you are outside the US it may be difficult for them to serve you with the lawsuit papers and they may have to serve it via publication in the newspaper. Thanks for asking.  I agree that it is likely that you are safe, but it is difficult to be certain due to the uncertainties of the legal system in the US.  Just bear in mind that they could obtain a judgment against you if they cannot find you.
6047	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.  Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  So, if you do not show up in court, can they win a judgment?  Yes.  But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money.  If they can find assets of yours in the US, they can seize those.  However, if all of your money is outside the US, it will be a challenge for them to collect the money.  Generally, it is more difficult to enforce a judgment in a foreign court and the process can be complex and lengthy.
6048	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.  Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  So, if you do not show up in court, can they win a judgment?  Yes.  However, if all your assets are outside the US, it may be difficult for them to enforce the judgment.  It is possible that they will have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated, which can be a difficult process.  There is still the possibility that they could collect the money, albeit difficult.
6049	Can they sue you even if you are outside the US?  Yes.  Can they sue you even if they cannot find you?  Yes.  The court will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  So, if you don't show up in the court, they can still win a judgment.  But if all your money is outside the US, it may be difficult for them to collect the money.  It depends on the situation; there is the possibility that it may be difficult to enforce the judgment.
6050	Race shouldn't be a defining factor in creating diverse communities. Everyone is unique, regardless of race, and no two people share exactly the same interests, beliefs and physical characteristics. It's important that people from different races are not excluded from communities of one race in order to make them more diverse.
6051	Race should not be a factor within a diverse community. Everyone is unique, and no two people are alike in terms of interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Although race should not be the determining factor, it is important to create communities that incorporate different races in order to make it more diverse.
6052	Race shouldn't be a factor in terms of creating a sense of community. Everyone should feel accepted and welcomed regardless of their race. We should recognize the uniqueness of every individual and embrace the differences between us, regardless of race.
6053	Race should not be a factor when creating diverse communities. Everyone is unique and has different interests, beliefs and physical characteristics. While it is important to include members of different races, they should not be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more diverse. Different races should be celebrated and accepted, regardless of skin colour or appearance.
6054	Race shouldn't be a factor when it comes to creating inclusive communities. Everyone is unique, with different interests, beliefs and physical characteristics. It is important that people from different races are included in communities, so that they feel accepted and respected regardless of their race.
6055	Although it can be risky to invest in a Kickstarter, it can be an effective way to fund projects that have the potential to change the world. Kickstarters provide an opportunity to support projects that may not have the funding they need from larger corporations, allowing creators to develop revolutionary ideas. Additionally, it may be beneficial to fund projects one is emotionally attached to in order to give them the chance to be seen.
6056	Kickstarter campaigns can be an attractive way to fund projects, as they offer the potential for backers to get rewards or equity in the company, depending on the terms of the campaign. However, this is only the case if the campaign is successful – if it fails, backers could end up with nothing. This means that there is an element of risk in investing in Kickstarter campaigns. However, for some projects there could be a greater payoff than just the rewards offered, such as equity in the company. This makes Kickstarter an attractive option for some projects.
6057	Kickstarter offers an alternative way to finance projects and products that might not otherwise receive funding. It provides a way for creators to access funds from a wider audience and bring their ideas to life. While there is no guarantee that a project will succeed, crowdfunding can provide a useful platform for them to reach their target audience and potentially gain additional funding.
6058	I see the potential in crowdfunding campaigns like Kickstarter as a way to bring attention to and fund innovative ideas, as well as giving people the opportunity to invest in something they believe in. While there is always the risk that a project may not succeed, equity crowdfunding offers the potential for rewards beyond financial gains, such as increased visibility and potential investments from larger corporations.
6059	Kickstarter offers a unique way to fund projects, allowing backers to receive rewards or a portion of the profits of the project they supported. While there are risks associated with investing in any project, these risks are balanced by the potential rewards of funding a project that could not have been made without crowdfunding. In some cases, Kickstarter projects can offer investors an opportunity to get a return greater than their investment. It is certainly true that crowdfunded projects may not succeed, but there is potential that they could change the world if they receive proper funding.
6060	I believe there is a social stigma around marijuana in spite of the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. This stigma is primarily due to societal norms. Marijuana is illegal in many states, even though it is legal in Colorado and Washington. Alcohol and tobacco have major negative effects on society as a whole, yet drinking and having a few beers are common activities used to either meet people or spend time with friends. This suggests that such activities are largely accepted by society. CMV.
6061	I believe there is a stigma in society towards marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and sugar are more dangerous than marijuana. This societal “norm” is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with.
6062	I believe there is a stigma in society towards marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, are generally accepted by society. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and even sugar can be more harmful than marijuana.   This societal perception is the only reason that marijuana is still illegal in many states, including Colorado and Washington, where it is legal. Alcohol and tobacco have immense effects on our society as a whole, yet going out to drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common activities people do to socialize or with friends.
6063	I believe there is a stigma in society towards marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. This stigma is largely due to the fact that marijuana is illegal in many states, even though it has shown potential medical benefits. Although alcohol and tobacco have far-reaching negative effects on society as a whole, getting together to socialize with friends is common practice in many places.
6064	I believe there is a societal stigma against marijuana, despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, are generally accepted by society. This stigma is the only reason that marijuana is illegal in many states, as well as the fact that its use is not permitted in many workplaces, even in states where it is legal. Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, yet drinking and smoking are some of the most common activities people do to socialize or spend time with friends.
6065	I agree that it is important to look at all information with an open mind. We should consider the sources of information and analyze it to determine its accuracy. Even if information is distributed through books, newspapers, or other mediums, we should consider its credibility before believing it. It is possible for individuals or organizations to spread misinformation through any medium, including online, so we should be aware of this and use our judgment when assessing the accuracy of a source.
6066	I think it is important to consider the source of information when assessing its credibility. Just because something is published in a book or a newspaper does not necessarily make it more accurate than something found online. We should always look at the information with an open mind and try to determine what is true and what is not.
6067	I believe that it is important to take all information with a grain of salt and to analyze it for oneself. Just because something is published in a book, newspaper, or online does not make it inherently more or less true. We should still examine all information with an open mind in order to determine what is true and what is not.
6068	I believe that information found online should be taken with a grain of salt, as we should take into consideration the source of the information. I believe that it is important to look into the information more deeply and analyze the source to determine its credibility. While information found in books or news channels may be more reliable, there is no guarantee that it is more truthful than information found online. We must consider all information carefully and evaluate its accuracy.
6069	I understand the point of having someone to hold accountable in the case of spreading disinformation. That is a great point. I guess I asked the wrong question though because obviously, statistically, there will be more lies seen online than in publications just because it is easier to spread.
6070	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. It is true that their education and poverty rates may be lower than others, but this can be partially attributed to past discrimination and difficulty in integrating into society. I am aware that these factors can have an effect on these statistics, but I do not wish to see these details.
6071	I think black people have their rights protected by the government, which provides them with the same rights as everyone else. While it is true that their educational attainment and poverty rates may be higher than others, this is more a reflection of past discrimination and their lack of successful integration into society. I am aware that these factors can be affected by various factors, and I do not want to see statistics about these issues.
6072	I believe that black people are given the same legal rights as everyone else in the state and I am aware that their educational attainment and poverty rates may be higher due to past discrimination or the lack of integration into society. I do not want to see statistics on these matters, as I believe that this does not reflect the true extent of discrimination against them.
6073	I believe that Black people are offered the same rights as other people under the law, although educational opportunities and poverty rates may be higher due to historical discrimination or other factors. I am not necessarily convinced by statistics about these issues, as I believe that integration into society can be affected by many factors.
6074	I believe that black people are granted the same rights as everyone else by the state, and I am aware that their education and poverty rates may be higher due to past discrimination or the lack of integration into society, but these factors can vary greatly depending on the state. I am not interested in statistics about these aspects; I believe that discrimination against them is a possibility.
6075	I know this is not true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam(as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should be like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousands of years of text seems restricting to me. I believe that people should have the freedom to decide their morality without being prescribed to by their religion.
6076	I know this is not true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam(as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should be flexible and evolve alongside society, rather than being set in stone by a religious text. People should have the freedom to choose their own moral views, without being confined by their religion. This would make the world a better place in my opinion.
6077	I believe that morality should be able to evolve over time, as new views come along. I think that people would be more accepting of these new views if they were able to decide for themselves, rather than having a religion dictate it to them. I am aware that there is room for interpretation, but I think the world would be a better place if people had the ability to decide for themselves.
6078	I believe that people should be able to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong, and that their moral views should not be solely dictated by their religious texts. I think this would make the world a better place.
6079	I believe that people should be able to decide their moral values based on their own understandings and experiences, rather than being constrained by a set of texts. Although there is room for interpretation, I believe that this restricts people's freedom to decide their own morality.
6080	Humanity's ultimate goal should be to explore and reach for the stars, discover and protect our natural environment, and develop technology to better the lives of all humanity. We should prioritize long-term sustainable development that allows for flourishing and innovation while preserving our planet and its resources.
6081	My vote is for promoting complex self-organizing matter as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could launch rockets with life support systems carrying millions of types of microbes to potentially habitable planets and moons in the hope that some would survive and spread. Then, when we find favorable conditions, we could land human colonies to begin life there.  As with any attempts at expansion, this plan carries risks. However, it gives us a chance at grandeur if we act now, before it's too late. Humankind won't be around forever, so we must take advantage of the window of opportunity we have.  Religions offer goals but they get so many simple things wrong that they can't be trusted. Their ideas should be ignored. We need a more effective purpose to rally around that encourages collective action and safeguards our species’ chance at grandeur.
6082	My vote is for promoting complexity in the universe through intentional, self-organizing processes. Nature has already shown us that such complex systems can evolve in the absence of human intervention, giving us hope that we can work towards preserving and evolving such systems while we are still around. We can use technology to increase the chances of success by creating the right environment and providing the necessary resources, while continuing to strive for excellence and make the most of our time on Earth.
6083	My vote is for PROMOTING COMPLEX SELF-ORGANIZING MATTER as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could explore the possibilities of gene editing and synthetic biology to increase the odds of success by tailoring organisms to specific environments. Alternatively, we could take advantage of advancements in gene-driving technology to spread modified genes of organisms that are adapted to specific environments. We could also build spaceships to explore and potentially settle other planets. We have the potential to do so much to give CSOM a chance at survival.
6084	My vote is for promoting complex self-organizing matter as our ultimate purpose. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could launch probes to distant planets in the hope that some organisms could survive and evolve. Then we could also attempt to establish human-like life on other planets. Such efforts may provide us with new homes and additional biodiversity in the long run. Humanity has the potential to spread to other worlds to ensure our survival and increase the scope of life in the universe.
6085	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but I believe that it is a poor example of news broadcasting. I feel this way because I believe other news outlets provide more balanced reporting which allows me to hear out both sides of the argument.
6086	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, and I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but I believe that they are a poor example of news broadcasting. I am open to other viewpoints, but I do not feel as though Fox News provides an inclusive environment for alternative ideas.
6087	I recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is biased in its reporting. This bias may be due to their reporting differing from my personal views. I believe that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, as I feel this limits my ability to hear out conservative ideas.
6088	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is biased in their reporting. It may be because it dissents from my personal views, but I still think that it stands out as an example of what news broadcasting should not be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them?
6089	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a low point of news broadcasting. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them?
6090	I believe that our world presents many challenges, such as environmental pollution, debt, inflation, peak oil, and climate change. However, I remain optimistic about the future of the world and humanity, as I believe we have the potential to tackle these issues if we work together.
6091	I would like to start off by saying I'm generally a positive person, although at times I do worry about the global state of affairs, such as the political corruption, environmental pollution, economic debt, inflation, peak oil, and climate change. I think the future of the world and humanity is a key concern of mine.  I would appreciate it if you could shed some light and give me more hope.
6092	I would like to start off by saying I'm generally a positive person, although sometimes I feel concerned about the current state of the world. Environmental pollution, debt, inflation, peek oil, and climate change are all issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure a better future for the world. It is important to have hope that humanity and the world can change for the better in the future.
6093	I can understand why you feel worried about the state of the world. Climate change, environmental pollution, and other global issues can be daunting, especially when considering their potential impacts in the future.   Although there are many challenges ahead, there are also some positive outlooks. For example, many countries are taking steps to combat climate change, and the population growth rate is beginning to slow. Additionally, many nations have made significant progress in renewable energy sources, which could become a more prominent part of the world’s energy mix in the coming years.  Though the future is uncertain, there is reason to be optimistic about the prospects of the world and humankind.
6094	I agree that the world is facing many challenging issues such as political corruption, environmental pollution, debt, inflation, overpopulation, peak oil, and climate change. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic about the future of the world and of mankind. While these issues are not easily resolved, I believe that collectively, humans have the ability to solve these issues.
6095	Going to college in a larger city can provide a similar social experience to a college town in terms of developing social skills and giving students the opportunity to live independently, as well as gain experience with forced interaction among peers. Moreover, attending a university with more students living near/on campus can result in a weaker social education, as graduates may be less socially competent than those who attended a more traditional 4-year university.
6096	To keep this conversation focused, I would argue that the social education provided by colleges is an important factor to consider, as living in a community helps students develop important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. Dorms, fraternities, and sororities offer invaluable experience living independently from parents with people of a similar age.  Going to a community college or 4-year university with very few students living near/on campus (aka commuter campus) provides an inferior social education. As such, graduates will be less socially competent than those who attended a more traditional 4-year university.
6097	To keep this a narrowly focused conversation, I propose that the discussion be limited to colleges in metropolitan areas as these provide the closest experience to a “college town”. While colleges in major urban areas can provide a similar experience, considering this factor makes the topic too broad for a productive discussion.   __________________________________________________________
6098	To keep this a narrowly focused conversation, large cities can be excluded from this discussion as colleges in these areas may provide a different social experience than a 'college town'. However, living and studying around a large number of peers can help build important social skills, as well as self discovery and development. This type of environment is also necessary for developing self-confidence and independence, even when parents are not present. Furthermore, forced interaction in dorms, fraternities and sororities can offer a valuable social education.   Overall, attending a 4-year university with fewer students nearby, or a community college, may result in students having less social experience and skills than those who attend a more traditional 4-year university.
6099	To keep this a narrowly focused conversation, I suggest colleges located in larger cities should be excluded from this discussion, as this factor makes the topic too broad. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a “college town”, this canopy creates an environment that limits student's exposure to other students and the broader community, thus limiting the student's social education.
6100	When unemployment is high in a country, businesses may seek to hire low-cost labor to reduce their costs. This can lead to the lower and middle classes competing with cheap immigrant labor, which depresses wages and creates a downward pressure on prices. This is beneficial to the employer but not the employee or consumer, who can afford to spend less. To counter this, there is a need to ensure there is sufficient growth in the labor market to keep up with demand, in order to maintain economic growth.
6101	If there is high unemployment in a country, like there is today in many western countries, why would there be an influx of more cheap labor? Expanding the labor market drives down wages for employers, who are incentivized to hire the worker they can pay the least. Forcing unemployed and lower-skilled individuals to compete with cheaper immigrant labor limits their earning potential. Utilizing skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, and manufacturing depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, as businesses intend this to keep labor costs down. Such labor helps the business more than the employee or consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages.
6102	If there is high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would there be an influx of more cheap labor? Adding more labor to the market does not necessarily benefit the economy. It can instead force employers to hire the employee they can pay the least, which depresses wages for lower- and middle-income earners. This can be avoided if skilled labor is used for construction, IT, and other industries, as it would benefit the employer more than the employee and consumer.
6103	If unemployment is high in a country, as is the case in many Western countries, it can be difficult for employers to hire workers due to the competition between existing labor forces. This can drive wages down, as employers tend to hire the cheapest labor available. This limits the purchasing power of consumers, who have to spend less on depressed wages.   Businesses using this tactic aim to keep labor costs down, which does not benefit the employee or the consumer. This can be detrimental to wage growth, especially for the lower and middle classes. Moreover, there is no need to bring in additional labor.   To sum up, unrestricted access to labor that is cheaper than existing labor forces can cause wages to decrease, leading to a decrease in purchasing power of consumers.
6104	If there is high unemployment in a country, such as in many Western countries today, why would there be an influx of cheaper labor? Swelling the ranks of labor can lead to more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and less skilled workers to compete with cheaper immigrant labor can depress wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, and manufacturing can lead to higher wages for the middle class, which can eventually become the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, as it is mainly done by businesses to keep labor costs low. This can benefit the employer more than the employee and consumer, who can end up spending less on depressed wages.
6105	If the government were to limit my ability to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me shifts to the government. In some cases, this could mean that the government needs to provide me with an equal chance of protection as if I myself had access to a gun in order to neutralize any threats (e.g. armed intruders). Ideally, this would give me enough time to survive if I am unarmed and facing off against an armed intruder.
6106	If the government limits my ability to defend myself and my property in the event of a potentially dangerous situation, I believe that puts the responsibility of my protection on the government. In my opinion, this means the government should be able to provide me with enough protection to give me an equal chance of survival as if I had a gun to face off against any threats. In reality, this means that police need to arrive within 10-20 seconds if an armed intruder is present.
6107	Governments are responsible for protecting its citizens from harm, and in some cases, this means providing people with the means to defend themselves. If a government deprives an individual of these means, then the burden of responsibility to protect that individual falls on the government. This means that if an individual is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, then the government shares some responsibility for not providing them with the means to do so.
6108	I believe that if the government limits my ability to defend myself and my property, then the responsibility to keep me and my property safe falls on the government. In other words, the government should be there to provide me with an equal chance of protection, such that I could potentially survive an attack if I were unarmed, as if I had access to a gun. This means that police must arrive within 10-20 seconds if an armed intruder is present.
6109	If the government attempts to limit my ability to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the responsibility to ensure my safety lies with the government. In my view, this implies that the police need to arrive in time for me to have a chance of survival if an armed intruder is present. It is possible that I may be able to escape if I am unarmed, but if I am unarmed and facing an armed intruder, the government shares some of the blame for not allowing me to defend myself if I am injured or killed.
6110	The conventional argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge and experience. This knowledge is usually collective, which means the results of applying this knowledge should benefit humanity as a whole. However, innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for a new purpose, requires individual effort and protection. Intellectual property laws are essential for encouraging such inventiveness and dedication. I believe that abolishing intellectual property rights could hinder progress and stifle scientific research.
6111	The usual argument is that anything that can be invented comes from previous knowledge which is collective in nature and therefore the results of such applications should be for the benefit of humanity as a whole. I believe that innovation, which is the ability to use knowledge in a new way, should be protected as individuals should be given the time and talent to pursue these ideas for economic purposes. Intellectual property laws are necessary for this to occur. Furthermore, I believe that abolishing intellectual property rights could have negative consequences as fewer individuals would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovation.
6112	The usual argument is that anything that can be invented must come from previous knowledge that is shared among humans. This knowledge is used to create new inventions, which requires time and talent from individuals and is a collective effort. Intellectual property laws are necessary to protect this investment of time and talent. I believe that abolishing intellectual property laws could limit innovation and progress in science and technology.
6113	The usual argument is that anything that can be invented comes from collective knowledge, which means that the result of applying such knowledge should belong to humanity as a whole. I believe that innovation, or the ability to use knowledge for a new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected through intellectual property laws. This allows individuals to benefit economically from their time and talent. If intellectual property laws were abolished, it could hinder scientific progress and negatively affect incentives.
6114	The usual argument is that innovation should be protected as such, as individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes. I believe that intellectual property laws are fundamental in providing an incentive for creativity and progress. Otherwise, this could be lost if such laws are abolished.
6115	I believe the killings of Palestinians in Israel are taking on the shape of genocide. When looking at the casualty numbers, it is clear that the casualties on the Palestinian side greatly outnumber those on the Israeli side. Moreover, it appears that Israel is targeting Palestinians based on a single criteria: if the person is from Palestine.  This does not justify the indiscriminate killing of civilians.
6116	I believe the killings of Palestinians in Israel are beginning to take on the characteristics of genocide. By looking at the casualty numbers, it is clear that the casualties on the Palestinian side vastly outnumber those on the Israeli side. Furthermore, it appears that Israel is targeting Palestinians based on one criteria - if the person is from Palestine. Hamas using civilians as human shields does not justify the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians.
6117	I believe the killing of Palestinians in Israel is taking on the forms of genocide. When looking at the casualty numbers, it is clear that the casualties on the Palestinian side far outnumber those on the Israeli side. Furthermore, it appears that Israel is targeting Palestinians solely based on one criteria-- whether or not they are Palestinian. This does not justify indiscriminately killing them.
6118	I believe that the killings of Palestinians in Israel are taking the shape of genocide. According to the numbers, the casualties on the Palestinian side greatly outnumber those on the Israeli side. It seems that Israel is killing purely based on one criterion: if the person is from Palestine. If Hamas is using civilians as human shields, that does not justify the indiscriminate killings.
6119	I think the deaths of Palestinians in Israel are taking the shape of genocide. By looking at the casualty numbers, it is clear that the casualties on the Palestinian side outnumber those on the Israeli side. It seems that Israel is killing primarily based on one criteria – whether the person is from Palestine. If Hamas is using its own people as human shield, it does not justify the indiscriminate killing of civilians.
6120	At every job I have worked at, from part-time to full-time positions, I have been told that I am not allowed to have any piercings (including clear studs) or visible tattoos. Ear piercings are allowed, but other forms of piercing must be taken out, which I believe is unnecessary and prolongs the negative judgement surrounding piercings that are not on the ears. I understand if the context of the tattoo or jewelry has an offensive image on it, but if there is not, then there should be no issue displaying them at the workplace. I believe this continued restriction of showing them further reinforces the idea that tattoos and piercings are seen as unprofessional and immature.
6121	In my experience, employers generally have the right to set their own policies regarding piercings and tattoos. While ear piercings are generally allowed, other types of piercings must be taken out, which I believe is unnecessary. I think this policy prolongs the negative judgment associated with body modifications, as tattoos and piercings are still perceived as unacceptable by some workplaces.
6122	In most workplaces, part-time to full-time employment, earrings are allowed but other piercings must be removed, which I believe is unnecessary. Tattoos should not be an issue if they do not have offensive images, but the idea that they are not acceptable to the workplace prolongs the notion that they are for immature, rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
6123	At every job I have worked at, from part-time to full-time positions, I have not been allowed to wear any piercings (including clear studs), nor have visible tattoos. However, ear piercings are allowed, which I believe is unnecessary and unfair. I believe that if the jewelry or ink does not have offensive images, there should be no issue in showing them at work. I think this policy prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are only seen as taboo among immature and rebellious citizens, when they can be a form of expression.
6124	At every job I have worked at, part-time to full-time, employees are not allowed to have any piercings (including clear studs) or visible tattoos. Ear piercings are allowed, but other piercings must be taken out, which I believe is unnecessary. I understand if the content of the tattoo or jewelry is offensive, but if there is none, there should be no problem showing them at work. I believe that this policy prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
6125	It is important to protect the right to freedom of religion as it is a fundamental right of people to believe and choose their own religious views. While atheism is not a form of religion, it is important to guarantee this right for people who do have religious beliefs as it is part of their personal identity. This guarantee of religious freedom is beneficial for both believers and non-believers.
6126	Freedom of religion has the potential to be beneficial in some respects, but I believe that it is more appropriate to have laws that allow individuals to choose their own religious beliefs rather than having a constitutional right to freedom of religion. This could lead to some people taking their beliefs more seriously and make them more accepted by the public, which would be beneficial in some cases. However, this concept is still relatively useless and potentially wasteful in the long run.
6127	I believe that there should be religious freedom in the United States, as it is important to allow people to practice the faith of their choice. While religion is a personal matter, it is also deeply intertwined with culture, so guaranteeing this right is important to preserve people’s traditions and beliefs.
6128	Freedom of religion is a fundamental right of people in a democratic society, as it guarantees the freedom to choose and practice a religion of one's own faith. It is important to ensure this right is protected in order to respect people's beliefs and ensure religious pluralism. While atheism may be a lack of religion, it is important to recognize the right of atheists to choose a religion if they so wish.
6129	Freedom of religion is a fundamental right that all citizens should have, regardless of whether they believe in a higher power or not. Even though atheism is not a religion, guaranteeing religious freedom allows atheists to choose their own beliefs if they so desire. Restricting this right could be seen as an infringement on individual liberty, which should be avoided.
6130	I believe that requiring an ID to vote is a reasonable requirement. Many activities, such as driving a car, drinking alcohol, or joining the military, require proof of age and identity. Voting is no different. Additionally, while some people question the need for voter ID laws, I believe that it mainly serves to protect the integrity of the vote.
6131	I keep hearing about this as a 'hot button' issue in the media.  I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are in fact of legal voting age is a fair requirement.  Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for(car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting.  Then there are even some states that have passed voter ID laws, which some people see as discriminatory, but I believe that these laws are necessary to ensure the integrity of the voting process.
6132	I understand the need for voter identification, especially given how important it is to ensure the integrity of the voting process. In some cases, such as purchasing alcohol or renting a car, individuals are required to present identification to show their age and legal eligibility, and I believe this is a reasonable requirement. While I recognize that some may view such laws as discriminatory, I believe they are necessary in order to protect the integrity of the voting process.
6133	I believe that requiring a photo ID to vote is a reasonable requirement. Most other activities, such as drinking alcohol, driving a car, or traveling by airplane, require a valid ID to comply with the law. This can be seen as a reasonable measure to ensure the safety of the voters and the integrity of the vote. However, there are some who do not see it as necessary, such as those who do not feel the need to obtain an ID.
6134	I understand the importance of requiring an ID to vote, as it helps to ensure the integrity of the election process. However, there are some who view these requirements as unnecessary and even discriminatory, arguing that it places an extra burden on voters. I believe that, while the ID requirements may be inconvenient for some, they are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the voting process.
6135	If I understand my history correctly, the 12-hour clock system is a relic from a time when there were not better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. This system makes it more difficult to understand numerically, as there is no need for a modifier such as “am”. Additionally, it could make mental calculations more complicated. However, 24-hour time could become the standard, which would offer many positives in terms of simplicity and mental clarity. It could also be beneficial to make a change from a traditional standpoint.  From what I understand, the 12-hour clock system is still used mostly due to tradition and a reluctance to change.
6136	If I understand my history correctly, the 12-hour clock system has its roots in the past, when there were limitations to how we measured and tracked time. However, the 24-hour system makes more sense numerically, since there is no need for a modifier such as “am” and it could simplify mental calculations concerning time. It could also reduce confusion among people by eliminating the possibility of setting an alarm for 7 pm.
6137	If I understand my history correctly, the 12-hour clock is largely a relic of the past, as it was largely based on the efficiencies of measurements during its development, as time measurement was still a relatively new concept at the time of its introduction. 24-hour time could prove beneficial as it provides a more logical, numerical time format, which would make mental calculations easier and make it simpler for the average person to set alarms. Additionally, it could help reduce confusion.
6138	24-hour time is more numerically consistent and can simplify mental calculations concerning time. Additionally, 24-hour time could make things less confusing for the average person since there is no need for an AM/PM modifier.  It also makes switching between time zones easier.  While 12-hour clocks are still widely used, it may be due more to tradition and/or hesitance to change.  In general, 24-hour time could prove to be beneficial for many reasons.
6139	If I understand my history correctly, the 12-hour clock system has largely remained in place due to tradition and resistance to change, even though 12-hour time may be less convenient for measuring and keeping track of time. 24-hour time would be more logical numerically, as there is no need for a modifier such as “am” to differentiate between the hours. This could make mental calculations simpler and prevent confusion when setting alarms.
6140	I believe that Fascism can be a positive and beneficial form of government, if implemented correctly with a strong leader such as FDR. However, it does not work with poor leaders such as Hitler or Mussolini, as is the case with Tojo. Ultimately, it was Tojo’s own decision to end the war, after seeing the destruction of the atomic bomb. If Fascism still existed with a competent leader in control, I believe it could bring prosperity to a nation.
6141	I believe that Fascism can be a positive and beneficial form of government if administered correctly, as it did under Franklin Roosevelt in the United States. However, this is dependent on the leader being competent and able to make the necessary decisions. In the case of Nazi Germany, the leader made wrong choices that ultimately led to the destruction of his country. Similarly, in Japan, Hideki Tojo made choices that caused the death and destruction of his people, even though he realised the futility of the war and surrendered after seeing the atomic bomb. In my opinion, a competent and great leader can change the fortune of a nation with Fascism.
6142	I believe that Fascism can be a positive and beneficial form of government, especially when it is led by an effective leader such as Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, it does not work when leaders such as Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini are in charge; it is dependent on the decisions of the leader. I believe that Hideki Tojo made the right decision in surrendering, as he saw the devastation of the Atomic Bomb and chose to avoid further bloodshed. If Fascism still existed with a great leader at the helm, I believe that the nation would prosper.
6143	I believe that Fascism can be beneficial to a nation and its people if it is implemented correctly with a strong leader, such as FDR. However, this form of government does not work with bad leaders, such as Hitler or Mussolini. In my opinion, Tojo made the right choice in surrendering when he saw the destruction of the atomic bomb. This could have been prevented if Fascism was still in place, with a competent leader in control. I believe that under this system, the nation could flourish.
6144	I believe that Fascism can be beneficial for a nation and its people if it is implemented correctly, with a strong leader such as Franklin D. Roosevelt. While it might not work with bad leaders such as Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini, in my opinion, Tojo was a competent leader who chose the wrong path. Nonetheless, he eventually chose to stop the bloodshed, after seeing the destruction of the atomic bomb.   I believe that a competent leader could lead a prosperous nation if Fascism was in place.
6145	We see naked animals all the time, and that sex is how most animals procreate is common scientific knowledge. Most people are able to coexist with nudity and sex, especially in public spaces. Although laws may regulate clothing and activity choices, this should only be allowed if people are allowed to be there legally and the activity takes place on private property, with the owner’s final say. Thus, there should be no laws regulating these activities.
6146	We often see animals without clothes and know that sex is how most animals reproduce, which is common scientific knowledge. Most people can cope with being exposed to nudity or sex, or even participating in activities in public places without issue. As long as there is no harm, the government should not regulate how we choose to dress ourselves or where we have consensual activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there.
6147	We often see naked animals in nature, and the fact that animals reproduce through sex is common scientific knowledge. Most people are able to cope with exposure to nudity and sex, especially when there are no other parties involved. There is no harm caused, so laws should not interfere with how we choose to dress ourselves or where we engage in consensual activities, as long as we are allowed to be there by law.
6148	We often see naked animals, and this is common scientific knowledge that sex is how most animals reproduce. Most people are able to cope with seeing naked animals or having sex without any issues, which indicates that there is no harm. Given this, it is best to allow people to choose how they want to clothe themselves and engage in activities, as long as it is legal for them to do so in the given location.
6149	We often see naked animals and know that sex is how most animals reproduce. People are biologically resilient, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn sets shows that there is no harm in this. There should be no laws regulating how people choose to dress or where they engage in consensual activities, as long as we are legally allowed to be there.
6150	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, the employee may be able to gain more skills and experience that can lead to a higher rate of pay in the future. While minimum wage jobs may not always offer potential for higher pay, there is the potential for promotion or raises in some positions, depending on the experience and skill level of the employee.
6151	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, they may be able to expect more than what is required, depending on the job. For example, jobs that require some skill or intellect may be able to command higher wages than the minimum wage required by law. However, this will depend on the job and the market rate for that job in the area.
6152	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, it can be difficult for the employer to recruit and retain employees who are willing to put in extra effort, especially when the job requires some skill or intellect in the first place. While employers may be able to offer more competitive salaries to attract and retain employees, this may not always be possible.
6153	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, they may expect more than what is required of the job in some cases, such as when it requires some skill or intellect. However, minimum wage jobs often require more skill and effort than the employer is willing to pay for, which may lead to employers expecting more output than is paid for. This could lead to employers expecting more than what is paid for, especially if the job requires some skill or intellect in the first place.
6154	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, it can be difficult for an employee to put in more effort or to acquire skills beyond the minimum required since there are usually no opportunities for promotion or raises in these types of jobs. This can make it more difficult for the employer to expect more than what is required of the employee.
6155	I agree that it is important to keep all ideas in mind when generating creative solutions, as this allows for a greater range of ideas to be explored. While it is necessary to qualify ideas to varying degrees in order to allow the creative process to occur effectively, I believe that holding back from rejecting ideas outright can provide a more fertile creative environment.
6156	I agree that it is important to keep all ideas in mind when trying to generate creative solutions, as one should qualify them to varying degrees. While it is important to be practical and reject ideas that do not work, it is essential to allow for the creative process to occur effectively. Overinclusiveness is one of the most essential conditions for this to happen.
6157	I agree that it is important to keep all ideas in mind when attempting to generate creative solutions. It is important to maintain a flexible mindset while honing and refining ideas. Over-imposing restrictions can impede the creative process, so maintaining an open mind is critical to its success.
6158	I agree that it is important to keep all ideas in mind during the creative process, as it enables one to identify and develop connections between ideas. While one should qualify ideas to varying degrees, this should not stifle the creative process. It is important to allow for the free flow of ideas so that the creative process can occur effectively.
6159	I believe that it is important to keep all ideas in mind when generating creative solutions, as this allows for more ideas to be explored. While one should qualify ideas to varying degrees, it is still important to allow creativity to flow. Overcensorship could impede the creative process, thus making inclusiveness a necessary condition for its success.
6160	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier he gets, which gives him an advantage over Thoughtprocess. This is why Thoughtprocess is often defeated by the Hulk. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply cannot defeat the Hulk.
6161	I believe the Hulk is one of the most powerful Avengers, since his strength increases with anger. This allows him to be formidable in battle. He is a formidable opponent against Optimus Prime, due to his high strength and the sheer amount of weapons he possesses, making him powerful. Although Optimus Prime has superior strength, the Hulk was able to hold his own in battle, indicating that he is a formidable foe.
6162	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages me to the point of near-insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o)  Although Optimus Prime is very powerful and has many weapons, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Thus, I believe that the Hulk is the stronger character.
6163	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues!
6164	I'd have to vote for The Incredible Hulk (AKA Thoughtprocess' Momma). The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. TP's Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk.
6165	I understand that there are different learning styles and academic abilities, and I believe that everyone has the potential to excel if they put in the effort. I believe that my academic experience thus far has prepared me well for my future academic and professional goals.
6166	Excuse me! I am a 17-year-old student who has worked hard to maintain a high level of academic success, including receiving mostly As and Bs in school. I recently joined the Army Reserves, and I am a member of my school's track team. I understand that people have different abilities and that some conditions are unfortunate, but I have been able to remain active and keep my grades up. I think it is important to keep exercising and staying in shape, both mentally and physically, as I enter my senior year of high school.
6167	I agree that there is a benefit to having some form of physical activity and exercise in school curriculums, as it can have positive impacts on students' physical and mental wellbeing. Additionally, I believe that the decision to make physical education a requirement should be left to the discretion of local education authorities, as it may depend on the region and the school's resources.
6168	I believe everyone is unique and has the right to reach their full potential. While I believe high academic achievement is possible at any age, I have been able to maintain a high level of academic success throughout my educational career. I have recently enrolled in my senior year of high school and am a member of the Army Reserves.
6169	I understand the importance of education and have worked hard to maintain a good academic standing in high school. I am a straight A student and am close to completing my senior year. While I am not a professional athlete, I have been active in sports, which has kept me in good physical shape.
6170	The Dark Knight is an epic tale, but Year One provides a different experience. It focuses more on a crime story, with Batman taking on corrupt cops and criminals with minimal technology. Miller also portrays Bruce Wayne as more noble in motivation, with a less revenge-driven drive. Although I feel that more could have been done with the story, four issues were made.
6171	The Dark Knight is an epic story, but Year One offers a different kind of tale. It focuses more on Batman fighting corrupt police officers and mobsters with few gadgets, giving Miller the opportunity to write a more noble version of Bruce Wayne. The art also perfectly captures the mood, with Batman looking like an athlete in a rental costume compared to the bodybuilder look of the Dark Knight. I would have liked to see more issues in the story.
6172	Dark Knight is a grand epic, while Year One’s strength lies in its subtlety. It focuses more on a crime comic than a superhero tale, as Bruce Wayne is less driven by revenge and more motivated by nobility. Mazzuchelli’s art fits the mood perfectly and Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, rather than a bodybuilder in body paint. I believe that the creators should have made more than four issues.
6173	The Dark Knight is an impressive epic, but Year One focuses more on a crime story than a superhero tale, with Batman fighting corrupt cops and the mob. Mazzuchelli's artwork perfectly captures the atmosphere, with Batman appearing as an athlete rather than a bodybuilder in body paint. Bruce Wayne's motivations are more noble, but I wish the series had been extended to more issues.
6174	The Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One's strength lies in its subtlety; it is more of a crime comic than a superhero tale, with Batman fighting dirty cops and the mob without the use of gadgets (Robin is absent as well). Mazzucchelli's realistic art fits the mood perfectly. Miller portrays Bruce Wayne as less revenge-driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they could have made more than four issues.
6175	I believe we should take action. Think about it: there are innocent people in Darfur who are being slaughtered without mercy, and we are standing by and letting it happen. If a similar situation occurred in our own homeland, we would want to help, and our assistance would serve as an example for the people in Darfur.
6176	I believe we should take action. Think about it: there are innocent people in Darfur who are being slaughtered without mercy, and we are standing by and letting it happen. If there was a group of terrorists in our homeland, we would want to provide assistance in order to prevent further damage and show the world that we are a force for good. It is the same situation in Darfur; providing aid can show that we are compassionate and set a good example for the world.
6177	I believe we should intervene. Consider this: if there were terrorists in our home country, we would want to help, as Darfur is the same situation. Even if we help, it could make the US look better internationally.
6178	I think we should take action. Genocide is happening in Darfur and we are standing by, allowing it to happen. Consider this: if there was a group of terrorists in our homeland, then wouldn't we want to help? It is the same scenario for the people in Darfur; they need assistance, but they are not getting it. By intervening, we can make a difference and put a positive image of the US forward.
6179	I think we should intervene. Consider this: if there was a group of terrorists in our homeland, then wouldn’t you want help? It’s the same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren’t getting it. By intervening, it would put a positive image of the US back on the international stage.
6180	I agree that it is too soon to judge a leader's performance, as the effects of a presidency are often long-term and can differ significantly depending on the context. However, I believe that it is possible to gain an understanding of a leader's potential and capabilities by looking at their history and the impact of their policies. Generally, it is necessary to have an understanding of history in context of one's own generation in order to make an informed judgment.  I am not a fan of Obama, but I recognize that America has had much worse leaders in the past.
6181	I believe it is too soon to evaluate President Obama's performance as leader of the US, as many of his policies have only recently been implemented. Although I am not a fan of Obama's leadership, it is impossible to make a definitive judgement on his term in office without more context. It is important to look at history objectively and consider the implications of each presidency.
6182	I believe it is too early to make a definitive assessment of President Obama's leadership, as his term in office is still ongoing. It is impossible to judge a leader's performance without considering the context of history. While I am not a fan of Obama, we have certainly had worse leaders in the past.
6183	It is too early to make a definitive assessment of a leader's effectiveness, as there is not enough objective history to compare the current generation with. While I am not a fan of Obama, it is impossible to say that he is one of the worst presidents America has had, as there have been far worse leaders.
6184	I believe that it is too early to judge President Obama's leadership, as his term in office is still ongoing. It is impossible to make a definitive assessment of a leader's performance without considering the full context of American history. There have undoubtedly been worse leaders than Obama, but I am personally less of a fan of his leadership.
6185	If you had more money, you would have more options. You could choose to live a certain lifestyle or take vacations if you wanted to, as well as support your hobbies and interests. This would give you more freedom to live the life you wanted.
6186	If you had wealth, you could choose your standard of living, take vacations, and explore your interests and hobbies. You could also use that money to help others if you wished, as money is a powerful tool for good.
6187	If you were wealthy, you would have the freedom to choose your lifestyle. You could travel, explore your interests and hobbies, and live the life you want. You could also use your money to help others if you wished.
6188	If you had more money, you would have more choices - you could travel, support your interests and hobbies, and live the life you wanted. You could also give money to the poor to show your support and make a difference, or you could use the money to hire a coach and other resources to feel more secure.
6189	If you had more wealth, you would have more options in life. You could travel, pursue interests and hobbies, and live the life you chose. If that did not meet your needs, you could use some of the money to fund a coach who would help you feel more secure and sense of wellbeing.
6190	I believe the penalties are appropriate. People have to register as sex offenders, serve jail time, pay fines, etc., depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the crime took place. It makes sense to impose these penalties on minors who commit these crimes, as they need to be taught a lesson. We need to have laws in place to protect society. Things are taken for granted too much in this generation.
6191	I think the consequences are reasonable. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc. are all punishments that are imposed to protect society and to deter future offenses. While it is understandable that these punishments are not deserved by all offenders, it is important to ensure that they learn the consequences of their actions. Teens and young people need to be aware of the gravity of the situation.
6192	I think the consequences are reasonable. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc., are all punishments designed to deter actual pedophiles. While minors may not have committed a crime in the same way, these laws are meant to educate them and deter future offences. It is important to learn from these experiences.
6193	I believe the consequences are appropriate. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc. are all punishments that are meant to act as deterrents and to act as punishment for the offenders. If teens and younger people are subject to this, it is because the government believes they need to be taught a lesson. Things are becoming too lenient these days and actions such as these need to be taken to ensure minors are aware of the potential consequences of their actions.
6194	I think the consequences are acceptable. People having to register as sex offenders, serving jail time, paying fines, etc. are all punishments that are designed to deter actual pedophiles. While teens and younger people may be impacted, it is important to remember that these actions are serious offenses that need to be addressed. Things are taken for granted too often in this generation.
6195	As a Catholic, I believe that it should be illegal to kill innocent babies, as the Catholic Church considers an egg fertilized as a baby. I believe that killing a baby should be illegal and that the government should enforce this law. Adoption should be encouraged to ensure that the baby has a chance at life. In my opinion, the government should be putting more resources into adoption agencies rather than senior care.
6196	As a Catholic, I believe that it should be illegal to abort a baby in most cases, as it is against my religion to take the life of an innocent infant. In the Catholic Church, once the egg is fertilized it is considered a baby, and I believe that abortion should be illegal in most cases, as the government should be doing more to support and protect the life of the child. Additionally, I believe that the government should be focusing more resources on adoption agencies and programs, rather than on senior citizens, in order to provide better protection and support for children and their future.
6197	As a Catholic, I believe that it should be illegal to abort a fetus as it is against my religion to kill innocent babies. In the Catholic Church, once the egg is fertilized it is considered a baby. I believe that killing a baby and not allowing it to choose is wrong and those who perform abortions should be imprisoned.   From other religions, it may be against your beliefs, but I still believe that it should be illegal. A government should put more funds into adoption agencies and less into senior care, as we need to invest in our future generations.   If the mother is raped or if it is incest, the baby should still be given a chance. It is still a live fetus and should be protected.
6198	As a Catholic, I believe that it should be illegal to terminate a pregnancy after conception, as the Catholic Church views fertilization as the point at which a human life is formed. I think it is important to ensure that children are given the chance to live, and that their right to life is respected. Moreover, I believe the government should invest more resources in adoption services to provide children with a better future.
6199	As a Catholic, I believe that it should be illegal to abort a baby in most cases, as it is against my religion to terminate a fetus that has the potential to become a baby. In the Catholic church, once the egg is fertilized, it is considered a baby. I believe that killing a baby, whether it has a chance of survival or not, should be illegal and those who choose to abort should face legal repercussions. While it may be against a person’s beliefs, I believe that the government should put more resources into adoption agencies and less into senior care.
6200	As a brief introduction, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. Therefore, for those who are less familiar with philosophy, there will be a debate within the debate. I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.  My first regular argument is that, even if you choose not to intervene and let the other people die, you are still effectively killing them. If you observe someone drowning in a lake, you are doing the same by not taking any action.  My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It states that everyone has infinite worth, but we are not respecting the worth of each of the individuals if we let them die.
6201	As a brief introduction to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. So, for those who do not have a deep knowledge of philosophy, simply argue the question. For those who have a more in-depth knowledge of philosophy, there will be a debate within the debate.  I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.  My first regular argument is that even if you do not actively let the other people die, by choosing not to kill the one person, you are still effectively killing them. If you witness someone drowning in a lake, and you simply watch and do nothing, you are still effectively killing them.  My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It states that everyone has infinite worth, but we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
6202	I believe that in some cases, it may be morally acceptable to kill one person in order to save the lives of others. This is especially true if the situation is such that the death of one person is essentially certain if action is not taken. Allowing the deaths of multiple people could potentially happen, which would be a violation of the principle of equal worth of each person. In such cases, it may be better to kill one person to save the lives of others.  In terms of deontology, I believe this is justified due to the principle of the worth of each person.
6203	As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. So, for those who don't know much philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who know much about philosophy, there will also be a debate within the debate.  I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.  My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them.  My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
6204	As a brief introduction, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but also of the philosophies behind it. For those who are familiar with philosophy, there will be a debate within the debate. I believe that non-intervention in a life-or-death situation could lead to the same consequence, where people will die, thus effectively killing them. Additionally, deontology argues that people have inherent worth, but by not intervening, we are not respecting the worth of the individuals.
6205	Violence is caused by a lack of social connection and understanding. Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inadequate, leading to feelings of isolation and insecurity. The news fuels this sense of disconnection by highlighting differences between us, which causes us to distrust each other and perceive each other as objects rather than as individuals. This lack of social interaction leads to us treating each other not as people, but as things to interact with.
6206	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society, in part, due to our exposure to advertising which reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them, as well as the news which can make us distrust each other. This distrust leads to us treating each other not as people but as things to interact with, which can lead to violence. We have these experiences due to the disconnect between our lives and what we see on television, which can cause feelings of frustration and anger.
6207	Advertising leads us to feel inadequate for not having the things we see, and the news leads us to distrust each other, which then contributes to violence. This is due to the inability to empathize with each other and the high pressure of modern life. We thus take out our frustrations on people around us.
6208	Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inadequate for not having them. The news and media can make us distrust each other, which causes us to treat each other more as objects than as people. This lack of empathy between us can lead to violence, as we do not see the world as a community and our lives are disconnected from each other.
6209	Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inadequate for not having them. The news, social media and other forms of media make us distrust each other, which leads to a sense of inequality and mistrust. We are more prone to violence when we feel disconnected from others, as society alienates us from each other and our sense of community is weakened. All of this contributes to a sense of anger and frustration, leading to aggression and violence.

6215	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious conflict in history."  Although the number of deaths is not a perfect measure of the severity of a conflict, it is worth considering the magnitude of the death toll when comparing different wars. Religion has a long record of causing death and misery, especially for those who did not conform to certain beliefs.
6216	Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious war in history. The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of “badness”. The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same number of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of ‘misery index’. It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.

6218	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious war in history. However, when looking at the number of people killed, it is important to take into account the increase in population over time, as religious wars can cause more devastation than modern day wars, even though the death tolls may appear to be lower.”
6219	Religious wars have resulted in higher fatalities in some cases compared to modern wars due to a higher population growth rate over time, even though the destruction caused by religious wars was worse. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index," which would take into account the chances of a person being born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Religion has a long record of causing misery, poverty, and killing significant percentages of unbelievers.
6220	Love is a complex emotion, which can develop between two people at any age. It is possible that a strong connection between two teenagers could lead to love, although it may take some time for the relationship to deepen. It is impossible to predict how an individual relationship will evolve in the future.
6221	Love is a complex emotion that may take time to develop. Teens are capable of having strong emotional connections to one another, which can lead to them falling in love. These connections may be strong enough to endure over time. Though there is no way of knowing for sure if these connections will last, it is possible that some will.
6222	Love is a complex emotion that is driven by a combination of factors, including emotional bonding and physical attraction. Although it is possible for two people to stay together and continue to have a strong emotional bond even after the initial attraction fades, this is not the case for all couples. It is difficult to definitively say whether or not two people experience true love, as this depends on the individual situation.
6223	Love is a complex emotion that can develop at any age, including during adolescence. It is difficult to predict exactly how long an attraction between teens will last, since it can vary from couple to couple. While some relationships may last, it is possible that attraction could decrease over time. Regardless, it is possible for love to develop between teens, even if it is slightly different from what adults experience.
6224	Love is a complex emotion that can develop over time, regardless of age. While the initial attraction between teens may fade over time, it is possible for love to still be present. It is difficult to determine whether love between teens is genuine or not, as the relationship dynamics between them and their partners may differ over time.
6225	I am not familiar with the details of the story, so I do not know what constituted the slap or the severity of it. However, I believe that sometimes it is necessary to intervene even if it means facing potential legal consequences. We must take action when we see an unsafe situation, as it is our humanity that compels us to act.
6226	I don't know this story, I'm not familiar with the details. I don't know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was or to what part of the body. There's a lot of information here I am missing. But I truly do believe that to turn one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance. While I may not know the exact details, I think it is important to intervene if we see an unsafe situation, as it is a part of our humanity to want to help.
6227	I do not know the details of this story and am unsure of the weight or location of the slap, so I am missing important information. However, I believe that it is important to take action in order to help, even if there is the possibility of legal consequences. It is difficult to say what I would do in this situation as it is dependent on the specific details.
6228	I don't know this story, I'm not familiar with the details. I don't know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was or to what part of the body. There's a lot of information here I am missing. However, I believe that sometimes it is important to act, even if it means subjecting oneself to legal consequences. It is difficult to say whether or not one would intervene in a situation such as this without having more information.
6229	I do not know the details of this story, such as how hard the slap was or where it was administered. It is possible that intervening in such situations could help prevent further escalation of the violence, although this would depend on the circumstances of each case. It is difficult to say with certainty without more information. In general, it is important to take action when possible to prevent violence and offer assistance, which is something I would consider doing if I were in the situation.
6230	We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed because of this? Probably. However, it is difficult to determine the impact of steroid use on records as it is difficult to confirm exactly how much impact steroids had on player performance. The Baseball Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history of baseball, both good and bad. It is not feasible to make decisions based on assumptions about steroid use, as it is impossible to be certain of the effects of steroid use on player performance.
6231	We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed because of this? Probably. But so what. The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history of baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous. It is crazy to let one person enter the Hall because we 'think' they took steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
6232	We need to accept that, for a roughly 20-year period starting in the mid-1980s, steroids were present in Major League Baseball. While this could result in some records being changed, it is likely that the Hall of Fame will acknowledge this period of baseball history. It is impossible to know for sure if an individual used steroids; if an individual has the potential to impact the game's history, it is better to include them in the Hall of Fame to recognize it.

6234	We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of baseball's records be broken and changed due to this? Probably. However, the Hall of Fame should recognize and commemorate the history of the game, both good and bad. It is unwise to exclude someone from the Hall of Fame because of suspected steroid use, as it is impossible to definitively prove or disprove usage.
6235	This debate to me, has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women, and these laws recognize that children have the right to form relationships with both parents. Courts may mandate that children live with their mothers in some cases, but in other cases, fathers may step in and raise them.
6236	This debate to me, has no clear-cut conclusion. Most MEDC's seek to provide equality for men and women, and here we are, exploring the potential consequences of these policies. In some cases, children may choose to live with their mothers, but there are others where fathers step in and fill that role. Ultimately, it depends on the situation and the individuals involved.
6237	This debate, to me, has no clear-cut moral; most MEDCs are aiming to provide an equal environment for men and women, which could potentially lead to children spending more time with their mothers. However, I believe fathers should step in and take care of the children if necessary.
6238	This debate to me, has no moral. Most MEDCs are looking to bring equality for men and women and here we are, looking at women having to raise children. Children have the right to decide who they would like to live with, which can be either a parent or the other guardian, depending on the situation. However, children need both parents in order to become well-rounded adults in the future.
6239	This debate to me, has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women, and in some cases, children have the right to choose who they would like to live with. As such, it is the responsibility of both parents to ensure that the child is able to reach their potential.
6240	I still enjoy the food at this restaurant, but I stopped going due to the lack of service. For instance, the place was not busy at 1 pm, but the waitresses acted as if they were still busy and the place was still dirty. The waitress we had (with red hair) was rude and made us feel unwelcome, even when we tipped generously as it was a holiday.

The waitress we had (with red hair) was rude and made us feel unwelcome, even though we tipped generously since it was a holiday.
6245	This place was not very welcoming. We walked in and the staff ignored us for over five minutes, which was quite strange. Eventually, they told us it would be a 10 minute wait. We waited a few minutes, and then they said it would be a 15 minute wait. There were clearly plenty of seats available. The manager in charge seemed to lack people skills.
6246	We were greeted warmly by the staff at this restaurant, although there was a slight delay in service. We were told it would be a 10-minute wait, which we subsequently waited for. We later heard that the wait time would be extended to 15 minutes. The staff were friendly and appeared to be managing the restaurant together.
6247	This place seemed to have less than friendly customer service when we arrived; we were not acknowledged for over 5 minutes, but there were employees who seemed to stare at us. When we inquired about the waiting time, we were told it would be a 10-minute wait, but then it was extended to 15 minutes. There were open seats available. This experience indicated poor people skills from the manager, who was apparently a young woman.

6250	I really enjoy this restaurant! I often come here when I am in the area and feel like having Korean BBQ. This is one of my favorite places alongside Gen and Hwaro.   I usually get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. The beef brisket is also good and there are plenty of sides. The steamed egg is always delicious after cooling down.   It would be nice if the menu had gyoza or other appetizers, but overall I will keep coming back. If my friends have room in their stomachs, we usually end up going to Rolled Ice Cream afterwards.

We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! The steamed egg is always great when cooled down.   I just wish this place had gyoza or other appetizers, but overall I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we usually end up going to Rolled Ice Cream afterwards.

6255	I have continued to enjoy my experiences at The Zen over the past year. The food is always high quality, and I find it to be my favorite compared to other restaurants. The service is always very friendly and attentive, and they always remember me upon revisiting. I have had pleasant conversations with Steven, who has welcomed me back each time.   I would recommend the Chicken Pakora, Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice, and Goat Curry. There are many other delicious options as well. I have been highly satisfied thus far with my experiences at The Zen.
6256	I have had a positive experience at The Zen since my last review. I have tried a variety of their food and have enjoyed it more than any other restaurant I have tried.

6260	We had a positive experience at this restaurant. Our server was attentive and helpful, and the food was of high quality. The bbq platter was excellent with a good variety of ribs, chicken, and tri tip. I especially enjoyed the chicken and ribs. The price of the platter was worth it for the quality and quantity of food. The beverages were a bit pricey but we were pleased with the souvenir glass that we were able to take home for an extra cost.
6261	We enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The food was good, the portion sizes were generous, and the atmosphere was pleasant.

The bbq platter was amazing, with ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, and a variety of sides. We were particularly impressed with the quality of the food, which was better than anything we've had back home.  Beverages are a bit pricey, but for $8.50 you can get a fountain drink in a souvenir glass that would cost $7.50 in their store. Overall, we were very satisfied with our experience.

6265	I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times as it is such a remarkable dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream come true.   We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home.   If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it, I would say it is the most tender meat you have ever had. It seems to me that the flaky shell around the meat steams it while it cooks, so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It is absolutely delicious!   Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I am looking forward to attempting a homemade version for the holidays using his YouTube guidance.

These flavors were definitely new and interesting to me compared to other steaks.  I look forward to making a homemade version for the holidays using his YouTube guidance.
6267	I have been wanting to try Beef Wellington for a while now, as it is such a unique and impressive dish. Seeing Gordon Ramsay's video tutorial on how to make it made me even more intrigued. I have never tasted it, but coming here was a dream come true.   We shared the dinner special of Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding and Mac n cheese. Everything was delicious and we were satisfied. The Beef Wellington was especially tender and cooked in a way that made it taste more like a roast than a steak. I was pleased.

6269	I was eager to try Gordon Ramsay's Beef Wellington as I had never tasted it before. To my surprise, it was even more delicious than I had anticipated. The steak was cooked perfectly - not too rare, not too well-done - and the pastry surrounding it gave it a nice texture and flavor. I can now attempt a homemade version using his YouTube tutorial.
6270	I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel was not fresh and the eggs were scarce. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.  We understand that Tim Hortons' menu items vary depending on the restaurant and the availability of ingredients. We also regret that the hash browns were not available.

This one was tiny and would have made an Egg McMuffin look large.  The coffee was hot, but we were unable to hold it for more than 10 seconds due to the lack of space.  We were already running late and had to catch a train, so we chalked it up as a loss.
6272	I had the Bacon, Egg and Lettuce on a pretzel bagel and my girlfriend had the Bacon, Egg and Cheese on an English muffin. The bagel wasn't fresh and the eggs were hidden on the plate. The portion size was smaller than expected. The coffee was very hot, which made it difficult to drink. We were already running late and had to catch a train, so we decided to leave without the hash browns. We felt this experience was a loss.
6273	My girlfriend and I recently had breakfast at a Tim Hortons prior to our train back to the United States. We had heard good things about the chain, but were disappointed with our experience.   I had the bacon, egg and lettuce on a pretzel bagel, which tasted stale. The eggs were scarce on the plate and the bagel was quite small. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin - this was even smaller and had the eggs overwhelmed by the bagel. We both agreed that the hash browns were lacking as well.   We were already running late, and they ran out of the hash browns without realizing it until after we paid. They eventually gave us a doughnut, which we didn’t want. The coffee was too hot to hold for more than 10 seconds, which was an inconvenience. All in all, it was an unsatisfactory experience.
6274	I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel was fine, but the eggs could have been found more generously. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  This one was very small compared to an Egg McMuffin;  it was disappointing.  We were already running late since they ran out of hash browns and only offered us a doughnut after we paid.  In the end, we had to throw it away.  We were dismayed since we had to catch a train soon and it was our first time at Tim Horton's.
6275	I believe that school uniforms can limit a student's ability to express themselves and their individuality, as students wear uniforms that are largely identical among their peers. Although school uniforms can create a sense of unity and equality among students, this could be considered restrictive to a student's ability to express themselves.
6276	I think school uniforms can be beneficial as they help to create a sense of unity and belonging within a school community, while limiting the ability to express one's individual style. However, I believe that there should be some flexibility to allow students to express themselves.
6277	I think school uniforms can be restrictive as students are unable to express themselves as much and the uniform may make them feel uncomfortable. While there are positives to wearing a school uniform, such as creating a sense of belonging and school unity, I believe students should have the opportunity to decide whether or not they wear the school uniform.
6278	I believe school uniforms can be beneficial in some ways, as they allow students to express their identity within the school community. However, I believe the lack of freedom to choose what to wear can be restrictive, which can make students feel less connected to their peers.
6279	I believe school uniforms can limit students' freedom to express themselves and their individuality, as the uniforms may make them feel less unique and distinguishable.

6290	I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if I did something like that, she would be there with me, comforting me and reassuring me that it was the right thing to do. Additionally, if she were to kill someone, it would be for a valid reason.
6291	No, I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if I were to do something like that, my partner would be there with me, comforting me and supporting me. Plus, if I killed someone, it would be due to a valid reason.
6292	I could not imagine physically turning my spouse in for such an act, as it would cause significant distress. I understand that if I committed such an act, my partner would be there for me, feeling vulnerable and isolated. Additionally, if I committed such an act, it would only be in a situation where I felt it was necessary.
6293	No, I could not imagine turning on my spouse in such a situation. I know that if I were to do something like that, she would be there with me, feeling vulnerable and not saying anything. Furthermore, if she were to take a life, it would be to protect me and our family.
6294	I could not imagine turning on my spouse in such a situation. I know that if I were to do something like that, she would be there with me, feeling the emotions and understanding the reasons behind it. Additionally, if she was to take a life, it would be for a valid reason.
6295	Books are better than TV in some respects. It is cheaper to purchase a book than a TV, and you also need to purchase a TV license if you want to watch TV. Books can help people learn, whereas some TV content may be either violent or not suitable for children.
6296	Books are generally more cost effective than TV, as you only need to pay for the book itself, whereas TVs can be quite expensive, as well as requiring subscription fees. Books can help you learn, while some of the content on TV is either violent or not suitable for children. Therefore, books are the better option overall.
6297	Books are better than TV in many ways. TVs are more expensive to purchase, as you have to pay for the TV itself as well as a license fee. Books can be more cost effective, as they offer learning opportunities and are often age-appropriate for children.
6298	Books are generally better than TV due to their lower cost; to purchase a TV, you would have to pay more and also need to buy a TV license. Books can help people learn, whereas some of the content on TV is either violent or not appropriate for children, so books are better overall.
6299	Books are typically more cost-effective than TV, as you only need to buy a book and do not need to purchase a TV license. Books can help with learning, whereas some TV content is violent or inappropriate for children, making books the better option.
6300	No matter what new technological developments emerge, books will remain popular among readers due to their physical and interactive qualities, ensuring they a permanent place in our hearts.
6301	Although books may face competition from new technological developments, they will always have a special place in our hearts as a reading medium.
6302	Books will continue to have a special place in people's hearts despite the emergence of new technologies.
6303	Although new technologies are constantly emerging, books have a special place in our hearts that will likely always remain.
6304	Although books may face some competition from new technological developments, they will always have a special place in people’s hearts due to their ability to provide a tactile and immersive experience that digital formats cannot replicate.
6305	I believe that India has potential to be a leader in the world, but its potential is limited by its current social and economic conditions. India's population is a major factor in its development, as the population is largely concentrated in urban areas, meaning that the government has limited control over the people and their resources. This coupled with the fact that the people are not encouraged to think about the country's development, leads to a lack of development.
6306	I strongly believe that India cannot lead in terms of area and arable land. Although India may have the second and third largest areas, these areas are not sufficient for India to lead. Furthermore, the people of India are mostly focused on their own interests and are not willing to invest time and effort into country development.
6307	I strongly believe that India cannot lead due to its size and population; India has the potential to be a major power, but its size and population make it difficult to rely on being second or third in terms of area or arable land. Furthermore, the people are often too focused on their own lives to concern themselves with the development of the country.
6308	I believe that India can play a leading role in the world if it is able to focus on long-term development and improve its infrastructure. India is ranked 7th in terms of area and 3rd in terms of arable land, but these are not reliable sources of power. Moreover, the people of India are more concerned with their own development and do not have the time to think about the country's development.
6309	I strongly believe that India cannot lead in terms of area and arable land. This is due to the fact that India has the second and third largest areas in the world, respectively, which is not enough to make India a leader. Furthermore, the people of India are not willing to invest time and effort into the development of the country, which hinders its progress.
6310	Well, India has its own set of challenges in managing itself that make it difficult to lead the world. Although India's literacy rate is increasing, almost 90% of the population is still illiterate, which makes it difficult for India to lead the world. Additionally, India is largely divided along caste, religious and political lines, which makes it difficult for the country to develop cohesive policies and strategies.
6311	It is understandable that India is still struggling to provide basic services to its citizens and develop its economy; this is a challenge that all nations face. India is making progress in education, but there is certainly room for improvement. India is taking steps to break out of its traditionally-defined social structures and create more opportunities for its people, but this is a process that requires time and resources. India is on an upward trajectory, and while it may still be some distance away from leading the world, its progress can be seen.
6312	India is still working to manage itself first and foremost. Though there have been significant improvements in terms of literacy rates, India is still behind many countries in terms of literacy levels. This puts it at a disadvantage when compared to other countries that are seen as potential leaders of the world.
6313	Well, India is finding it difficult to manage itself first. While it is possible to lead the world, India is still behind in terms of literacy rates, with roughly 90% of its population being illiterate. India is also more focused on castes, politics, and religion, which can hinder its development. Thus, it is difficult to say that India will lead the world if it is unable to lead itself.
6314	India faces many challenges in terms of poverty, literacy, and development, which makes it difficult to become a leader in the world. In terms of literacy, India's adult literacy rate is estimated to be around 71%, which is lower than other countries in the region. Additionally, social issues such as caste systems, politics, and religions continue to be obstacles to development. India has not yet demonstrated the capability to lead the world, as it is still struggling to achieve growth and development in its own country.
6315	India has the potential to lead due to its large human capital and military strength, as well as a nation full of hope and aspirations. We Indians believe that anything is possible and we are proud of our heritage and achievements, with over 34% of scientists at NASA being Indian.
6316	India has the potential to lead due to its second-largest human capital and third-largest army in the world. India is a country of hopes and aspirations, and Indians have an understanding that nothing is impossible. Also, 34% of the scientists at NASA are Indians.
6317	India has the potential to lead due to its second-largest human resource and its growing economy. It is a country of hopes and aspirations, and as Indians, we believe that nothing is impossible. We are proud of our Indian heritage and are grateful for the contributions of our Indian citizens, such as the 34% scientists at NASA.
6318	India has the potential to lead due to its second-largest workforce and its large number of hopes and aspirations. We are proud to be Indians and believe that nothing is impossible. Additionally, 34% of scientists in NASA are Indian, which highlights our country’s potential to lead the world.
6319	India has the potential to lead due to its second-largest population, as well as its high number of aspirations and determination as a country. India is proud of its accomplishments, with many Indian citizens believing that nothing is impossible. Additionally, 34% of the scientists at NASA are of Indian origin.
6320	Growing up without a father can be difficult, as you may never fully know that father or have a relationship with them. However, having a father in your life can bring its own heartache, such as not knowing your father and them not being a part of your life. This can be preferable to having a father who comes and goes in your life.
6321	Having a father who is physically present may be helpful in some ways, as you can build a relationship with him over time, but it does not completely bridge the gap of having no connection with him. To me, this lack of presence can be more damaging than having a father who is physically absent, as it denies you the chance to get to know him and create a relationship.
6322	Having a father can provide valuable stability and emotional support, although having one does not necessarily guarantee this. Knowing your father is there can help build trust and provide a sense of security, but it can also be upsetting if the father is physically present but emotionally absent. To me, this lack of connection can be just as damaging as having a father who comes in and out of your life.
6323	Having a father who is physically present can be helpful in some ways, as you may be able to form a bond with him over time. However, the absence of a father who is physically present can cause emotional pain as you may not know him as well as having a father who is present.
6324	Having a father who is physically present may be enough for some, but for me, the absence of a relationship with my father can be difficult, even if I only know him through stories. It is preferable for me to have a father who is consistently present in my life.
6325	I think it would be better without a father in some cases. This is because I have never had a father figure in my life. I think parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, rather than just being lazy or ineffective. Though a mother can definitely raise a son as well as a father, I believe I would have learned more from a fatherly figure.
6326	I think it would be better to have a father's influence in a child's life. I think that if you have a bad father, you can learn similar behaviors and attitudes, which can have an impact on a child's upbringing. It is also important for a father to set an example for the child and provide a sense of security and stability. However, the mother can also play an important role in the upbringing of a son, as my mother did.
6327	I believe that being fatherless can have an impact on a child’s upbringing, as I have never had a father in my life. Although parents are supposed to be setting an example for their kids, I believe a mother can also play an important role in raising a son. I have seen my mother take on this role.
6328	I think it would be better without a father, as I have never had one in my life. I think that if parents are lackluster, the child can learn bad habits from them, which is not ideal. Parents are supposed to be setting an example for their children, not just be lazy and that type of thing. I believe a mother can raise a son in a similar manner to how a father can.
6329	I believe it would be better to have a mother as a role model rather than an absent father. I believe that parents are supposed to be setting examples for their children, and that this can be done just as well by a mother as it can by a father. However, having an absentee father can hinder a child’s upbringing. I feel that this could be the case especially if the father is not present.
6330	Growing up without a father can be difficult, and it is understandable that one may feel anger or resentment toward their father figures. However, having an absent father does have its advantages, as I have been able to maintain a close relationship with my mother. Though I believe it is beneficial to have a father in one’s life, it is possible to still have a strong relationship with your mother without one.
6331	Growing up without a father can be difficult, as I have found over the years. Although I have had to deal with the absence of a father figure in my life, I am grateful to have had the presence of a mother who has been supportive. 18 years ago, my parents could have chosen to be in my life, but they chose not to. Though I understand their decisions, I believe it is better to have a mother who is able to provide the love and support I need.
6332	Growing up without a father has its challenges, especially during a child’s formative years. I have been fatherless for 18 years, and while it has had its difficulties, I have learned to appreciate the support I have from my mother. Having a father who is present and supportive would be preferable, but I believe having a strong maternal relationship is better than nothing.
6333	Growing up without a father can be difficult, as I have experienced for the past 18 years. Although I have had a strong relationship with my mother, it is still different not having a father figure in my life. I believe that having a strong support system, such as my mother, is key in making up for the absence of a father.
6334	I believe having a father is important in many ways, however, I have been able to overcome this experience. I have had my mother as a parent throughout my life and this has worked out well for me. It is better for me to have a mother who is supportive and involved in my life instead of a father.
6335	No. Though Farquhar did not take any direct action to help Singapore while Raffles was away, it is likely that he acted to prevent any further deterioration of the situation given the lack of governance in Singapore at the time. His presence may have limited the spread of vice, crime, and gambling dens.
6336	No. While Raffles was away in Java, Quarry was the Lieutenant Governor of Singapore and had responsibility for the territory. He did not take measures to halt or reduce the vice, crimes and gambling that was taking place during this period, which allowed these activities to continue.
6337	No. While Raffles was away in Java, Farquhar did not take any action to help Singapore. Instead, vice, crimes and gambling dens were allowed to continue unchecked.
6338	No. While Raffles was away in Java, Farquhar is charged with failing to take action to help Singapore, instead allowing vice, crime and gambling to continue unchecked.
6339	No. While Raffles was away in Java, Farquhar is believed to have done little to help Singapore, allowing vice, crimes and gambling dens to continue unchecked.
6340	In the past, children had more freedom to roam, such as going to the nearby candy store or school. However, due to the rise of online child pornography and sexual predators, this has become more dangerous and new crimes are enabled by this.

6343	In the past, children had more freedom to roam as they pleased, to and from the candy store, school, etc. However, due to the availability of online pornography, there are now more risks of child exploitation, cybercrimes, and sexual predation.
6344	In the past, children were more free to roam, such as to and from the candy store or school. However, with the rise of online child pornography and sexual predation, these activities have become more dangerous, potentially creating new crimes.
6345	Having sexual desires is a natural part of human nature, but this does not mean that people should watch others engaging in pornographic content, particularly if they do not know the other person. It is important to maintain a certain level of privacy when it comes to intimate content, particularly if it involves two people who are in a relationship with each other.
6346	Although humans have sexual desires, it is generally not appropriate for strangers to view sexual content, especially when it involves minors. It is natural to have sexual desires for the person you love.
6347	Even though humans have sexual desires, it is important to maintain privacy and boundaries in matters of sexuality. While it is natural to have sexual desires, people should only watch content that is specifically tailored to their own preferences.
6348	Even though humans have sexual desires, it is important to maintain privacy and individual autonomy. People should be able to watch pornographic content anonymously and without judgement.
6349	Having sexual desires is a natural part of being human, although people generally have them for those they are close to. Watching sexual content may be a private matter between two people, and it is generally not acceptable for strangers to view such content.
6350	Evolution can be seen as a process of change over time, with species adapting to their environment and genetic variations allowing for new species to form. This is a process that is supported by scientific evidence and observed in the fossil record, as well as DNA and genetic data.
6351	Creationists often propose evolutionary models that differ from the scientific theory, such as intelligent design or static hierarchical models of species development.
6352	Evolution as proposed by creationists is a belief that species were created relatively recently in an instantaneous process, typically called special creation. This view is in conflict with the scientific understanding of evolution, which states that evolution is a gradual process occurring over time.
6353	Creationist versions of evolution generally omit important components such as natural selection andCommon Descent, which are key factors in traditional evolutionary theory.
6354	I would argue that the Creationist version of evolution provides a more compelling explanation for the origin of life on Earth than the scientific version, as it is supported by more scientific evidence and is consistent with the beliefs of many religions.
6355	I believe that human evolution has occurred over time, although the process has likely been slower since the dawn of written history, as evidenced by archeological findings and genetic studies.
6356	I believe that human evolution has occurred over time, although the process has been slow and steady, rather than marked by dramatic shifts.
6357	I believe that humans have evolved over time, as evidenced by physical and cultural changes that have occurred across different parts of the world over the course of history. However, these changes have been incremental rather than sudden, which is why the evolutionary process has remained relatively consistent in the records that we have.
6358	I believe that humans have evolved over time, although the process has likely been slower since the beginning of recorded history than in earlier periods due to different factors.
6359	I believe that human evolution has occurred over time, though the process has been slow and incremental, with no significant changes occurring since the beginning of recorded history.
6360	Evolution is an ongoing process, and its exact timeline and triggers are still mysteries. It is possible that evolution could still occur, although at a much slower rate. We do know that evolution has occurred in the past, and it is still occurring today. It is impossible to say when and why evolution stopped in certain regions, as these events could have happened over thousands of years with no direct evidence remaining.
6361	Evolution has occurred gradually over time, with organisms adapting to their environments in response to natural selection. This process can take millions of years, and it is impossible to predict when and where evolution will occur. There is no definitive answer as to why evolution has stopped in some areas and continues in others.
6362	Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over thousands of years. While this process may have begun with a rapid expansion in the early stages of species' development, it is not necessarily a rapid process over long periods of time. This could explain why some species have evolved more rapidly than others, which could explain the current discrepancies between species.
6363	That evolution has slowed down over time is a mystery, as it could have happened at any point in time. We do not know why evolution has halted in some species but continues in others. This could be due to changes in the environment, genetic factors, or other factors that affect the development of a species. It is also possible that evolutionary events occurred in the past, but are no longer occurring today.
6364	Evolution can happen over long periods of time, and it is difficult to say why certain changes occur at certain points in history rather than others. We cannot say for sure why evolution has stopped occurring in some instances, but it is likely that there were external factors which affected it.

6370	It is important to get regular exercise in order to stay healthy and active. It is much more beneficial to go outside and take part in physical activities, such as playing football, rather than spending excessive time indoors playing video games. This is to ensure that one's energy levels remain high and that one is able to maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
6371	Going outside and exercising can be a great way to get energy and improve physical health. Although some activities such as playing video games can be enjoyable, it is important to take time to get physical activity as well.

6374	Going outside and exercising can help people stay healthy and reduce the risk of health issues associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Even simple activities like walking and gardening can make a difference.
6375	I believe that physical exercise is important for children's health and growth, as it can help reduce the risk of obesity and other health problems. Therefore, I believe that schools should provide access to gym facilities, as this could help to improve the health of the students.
6376	I believe that having a gym in schools can be beneficial for children as it can help them stay active and healthy. This is important as childhood obesity is a problem, which can lead to various health issues in the future.
6377	I believe we should have gym in schools as it is important for children to stay active and healthy. Childhood obesity is an issue, and gym can help to address this by ensuring kids maintain a healthy weight.
6378	I believe that having a gym in the school curriculum is important to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles among students. Although it is true that children may become more active and increase their fitness levels through physical exercise, it is still essential to provide an environment that encourages good health.
6379	I believe that providing access to gym facilities in schools can be beneficial for children, as it encourages them to lead active lifestyles and maintain a healthy weight. This is particularly important as many children these days are at risk of becoming overweight or obese, which can have a negative impact on their health.

6395	It is important to respect an individual's right to make their own decisions regarding abortion, as this is a highly personal issue that affects only the person involved. Ultimately, it is up to the person involved to make this decision, and it should not be regulated by outside parties. While this is a difficult decision, it is important to ensure that the individual's rights are respected.
6396	It is a personal decision that should be left to the individual involved. While the issue is a contentious one, it is important to respect people's right to make their own decisions and ensure their safety.

6400	Hitler's mother was advised to terminate her pregnancy due to a prenatal diagnosis, which was common practice at the time. Although abortion was legal in some countries, her wishes to keep the baby were not respected.
6401	Hitler's mother was against abortion, and wished to keep him as a child, which was rare at the time. Had abortion been legal, she may have chosen to have it, although this is speculative.
6402	Hitler's mother wished to terminate the pregnancy. Had abortion been legal at that time, she may have been able to do so.
6403	Hitler's mother likely found out she was pregnant with him at a young age, which could have been difficult and traumatic for her due to the circumstances at the time. However, abortion was illegal in Germany until 1946, so she would not have been able to terminate the pregnancy legally.
6404	Hitler's mother was offered the opportunity to have an abortion, which was relatively common at that time. Abortion was legal in some countries and states, so it was something she could have done if she wanted to. In the end, she chose to keep Hitler and give birth to him.

6419	According to a Northwestern University law professor, easy access to pornography may be one of the reasons why rapes have decreased by 85% over the last 25 years.
6420	If society were to view pornography and its producers more favourably, then no argument could be made that pornography was degrading anyone. Likewise, if society were to criticize actors, the act of being an actor would become degrading. It is not the act of producing pornography that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
6421	If pornography and the people who produce it were accepted by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It is the acceptance of pornography in society that needs to change, rather than the production itself.
6422	If pornography and the people who produce it were better accepted by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone.  Similarly, if society were to criticize an actor's performances, then the act of being an actor would become degrading.  It is not the production of porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
6423	If society were to be more accepting of pornography and the producers of it, then there would be no argument that it was degrading anyone. Similarly, if society were to criticize actors, then the act of being an actor could become degrading. It is not the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather society's acceptance of it.
6424	If pornography and the people who produce it were accepted by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It is not the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
6425	Some people argue that God is against pornography based on religious teachings, which state that pornography was not widely available in biblical times; however, this does not necessarily mean that it is a sin. While the Bible does not explicitly state that pornography is a sin, religious teachings suggest that it is.
6426	Some people believe that God is against pornography, as it was not widely accessible during Biblical times. However, the Bible does not address the issue of pornography directly, making it difficult to know for certain that it is a sin.
6427	Some people claim that God is opposed to pornography, but we cannot definitively say so, as pornography did not exist during Biblical times. Although the Bible contains laws regarding sexual conduct, it is difficult to know for certain that pornography is a sin.
6428	Some people argue that God is opposed to pornography based on Scripture, which states that God alone sets the standards of what is right and wrong. However, pornography was not widely available in Bible times, so it is difficult to know for certain that it is a sin.
6429	Some people argue that God is against pornography, as the Bible does not specifically address the issue of pornography, which was not widely available during Biblical times.

6430	I believe that advancing the common good is the preferred option. This is because it is better to help others than just focus on ourselves. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone worked together to take care of their community, it would be safer and better for everyone in the long run.
6431	Advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit, as helping others can have a more positive impact on our communities than simply focusing on ourselves. By improving our communities first, we can create better environments for everyone.
6432	I believe that advancing the common good is more beneficial than personal pursuit. This is because it is better to help others than just to think about ourselves. We should improve our community first so that there are no dangerous places and a better living environment for everyone.
6433	I believe that advancing the common good is preferable to focusing solely on personal interests. This is because it is better to help others than to only think about oneself. We need to improve our community first in order to create better environments for everyone. If everyone was able to take care of their community, then there would be fewer dangerous areas.
6434	I believe that advancing the common good is more beneficial than pursuing personal interests. This is because it is better to help others rather than just thinking about ourselves. Developing our community should be a priority first, which would reduce the risks of dangerous areas.
6435	Advancing the common good is better because of the importance of having a collective effort, as teams can be more successful than individuals. For example, football is a team sport where teamwork is key; the players must have faith in each other and support one another in order to be successful. This is similar to the notion that two are better than one because of the greater reward they can obtain from their labor.
6436	Advancing the common good is better because it encourages cooperation and collaboration among individuals, which can lead to a greater reward for their efforts. For example, in football, the success of a team depends on the players believing in each other and having trust in their abilities, as well as the quarterback believing in the linemen and the receivers to make a good pass. Therefore, a collective effort is needed to achieve success.
6437	Advancing the common good is better because, as the Bible states, "Two are better than one; for if one falls, the other can pick him up" (Mark 1:10). This is especially true when it comes to team sports like football, where each player relies on the others to make the team successful. The quarterback, linemen, and receivers all had to believe in each other and work together for the winning drive in the Super Bowl. Thus, we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6438	Advancing the common good is better because, as the Bible says, “Two are better than one; for if they have a good return for their labor, it is due to the faith that each has in the other” (Matthew 17:20). For example, in football, a team must believe in each other and depend on each other to be great; this is true of the Super Bowl, where the Steelers could not score the winning drive without the linemen blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the linemen, and the receiver believing in the quarterback. Thus, we need each other to be great.
6439	Advancing the common good is better because it allows for cooperation between individuals, enabling them to reap greater rewards from their labor. For example, in football, players must believe in each other and have trust in order for the team to succeed. This is true for any team sport, where a combination of players’ efforts is needed to achieve success.
6440	I believe that advancing the common good is more beneficial than pursuing individual interests, as people tend to look out for themselves first and not think about the greater good. However, I believe that what goes around comes around, so when you do something for others first, not only does it help them, but something good will also come back to you and help you to further improve yourself.
6441	I believe advancing the common good is better than pursuing individual interests as most people will look out for themselves first, which may not benefit anyone in the long run. I think the "what goes around comes around" concept, where you help others before yourself, will eventually benefit everyone as you improve your own situation.
6442	I believe it is better to focus on advancing the common good, as opposed to focusing on individual pursuits, as most people will only look out for themselves and not for others. In the long run, this does not benefit anyone. I think the “what goes around comes around” concept applies, in that when you take action to benefit others first, something good will come back to you and help you to better yourself.
6443	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit as most people will tend to look out for themselves rather than for others. Although this may seem beneficial in the short-term, it is not beneficial in the long-run. I believe in the ‘what goes around comes around’ idea; by helping others first, not only does it benefit them, but something positive will come back to you and help you better yourself.
6444	I believe that advancing the common good is better than pursuing personal interests, as most people will look out for themselves first, which may not be beneficial in the long run. I think in the 'what goes around comes around' sense, as when you do something for others before yourself, it helps not only them, but also yourself better.

6455	Having the flexibility to choose what to wear can be advantageous, as it eliminates the need to worry about what you have to wear. This makes school attendance less awkward when it comes to school uniforms.
6456	Schools generally require students to wear uniforms to create a sense of cohesion and eliminate competition between students regarding what they wear. However, students often have more freedom to choose what they wear when it comes to wearing school uniforms, as compared to wearing school mufti.

6465	I believe it is better to have a lackluster father than no father; as this can have a major impact on your childhood. Growing up without a father can be difficult as there is uncertainty regarding who he was and what he was good at, as well as not being able to prove to him that there is potential in him.
6466	I believe that it is better to have a less than ideal father than no father at all; this is because growing up fatherless can have a significant impact on your childhood. This means wondering about who your father was and what he was bad at or good at. As well as growing up without a father can mean that the son the father made cannot become a brighter and better person in society.
6467	I believe it is better to have a father in the home even if he is not completely involved in the child's life, as this can have a significant impact on the childhood. This means not knowing who your father is, as well as not being able to prove to him that there is greatness in him. Growing up without a father can limit a child's potential in society.
6468	Having a father is important for a child's upbringing, as it provides a sense of security, stability and identity. Without a father, a child may grow up with many unanswered questions about their father, as well as a feeling of not being able to prove to their father that they can achieve great things. This can have an impact on their childhood.
6469	I believe it is better to have a father in the household than no father; as this can have a significant impact on childhood, particularly with regard to wondering about who your father was and what he was like. Additionally, growing up without a father can hinder one’s potential of proving to the father that there is greatness in him.

6500	Banning plastic bottled water could be a mistake in the short term, as it is a source of income for many people in the US and helps the economy recover.

6505	Canadian laws and policies are different from those in the U.S., so it is important for us to be aware of and informed about the decisions made in the U.S. This can have an impact on us in Canada, such as through trade, travel, and other matters.
6506	As the United States has a major influence on global affairs, it is important to keep informed of decisions made there. Canada is not the only country affected by U.S. policies, so it is helpful to have an understanding of how U.S. decisions could impact other countries.
6507	The decision made by the U.S. government could have implications for countries outside of the U.S., including Canada, so it is important to be aware of these changes even if they occur in another country.
6508	Why are you making this decision an issue of nationality, when the U.S. decision could have implications for countries outside of the U.S.? Additionally, the decision could affect countries such as Canada, where the laws of the U.S. could have an impact on our own policies and laws.

6535	I'm sad to see the direction this has gone in. With so few exceptions, I choose atheism over Christianity due to a lack of evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions without providing answers.
6536	I'm sad to see the way this has gone. Although I am an atheist, I think Christianity has many compelling aspects and that the lack of evidence within it makes me uncomfortable. While I find Christianity raises many questions that it fails to answer.
6537	I'm disappointed to see the current state of this conversation. While I initially chose atheism over Christianity, I felt that Christianity raises too many questions without providing enough answers to satisfy my curiosity.
6538	I'm sad to see the direction the conversation has taken. With a lack of respect for other beliefs and an increase in spamming, I choose atheism over Christianity due to the lack of evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it fails to answer.
6539	I'm sorry to see the direction this conversation has taken. While I remain an atheist, I recognize that Christianity has certain benefits and that there is a lack of convincing evidence for it which raises many questions which it does not answer.
6540	Given the vast complexity of the world around us and the human experience, it is difficult to prove the existence of any single religion or belief system without a substantial amount of evidence. However, I believe Christianity provides a robust set of beliefs and theories which, when taken in combination with the available evidence, provides a plausible explanation of the world and our existence.
6541	Given the vast complexity of the world and the many uncertainties surrounding the origins of life, it is reasonable to have doubts about any belief system. However, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Christianity is a valid faith, based on historical and archeological records. It has been demonstrated that Jesus lived and had a profound influence on the Jewish culture of his time, which eventually spread beyond the Jewish people. While this evidence is compelling, it is still important to consider other religions and beliefs in order to form a belief system.
6542	Given that Christianity is a belief system rooted in faith and spirituality, it is difficult to prove the veracity of its claims with empirical evidence. However, there is a wealth of historical and philosophical evidence that suggests the plausibility of Christianity when examined from a logical perspective. Furthermore, evidence from other religions and alternative belief systems need to be taken into consideration when evaluating any belief system.
6543	I understand your skepticism, but I believe Christianity is a logically plausible religion. I have found evidence that points to the existence of a higher power and an afterlife, based on both empirical and priori arguments. I also recognize the diversity of other beliefs and respect the right of individuals to practice any religion they choose.
6544	I understand your skepticism, but Christianity is a widely held belief that has been maintained throughout history, and there are many logical reasons to believe it. For instance, some Christian beliefs align with scientific fact, such as the Big Bang theory and the idea of a creator God. Additionally, there is archaeological evidence that suggests the Bible is generally accurate in its descriptions of certain events. Finally, Christianity emphasizes the importance of morality, which is grounded in many cultures and religions.
6545	Science has not proven the existence of God. This is an issue that goes beyond what science can currently explain and where beliefs and interpretations of religious texts play a role.
6546	Science has provided evidence that suggests there may not be a God, which provides an explanation for the existence of the universe that is compatible with modern understanding. This explanation is supported by scientific theories and allows us to make sense of the universe’s origin without the need for a higher power.
6547	The notion of a higher power has largely been replaced by a belief in evolution, which explains the emergence of life and the universe without the need for a creator. Science has since shown that the origins of life and the universe can be explained through natural processes, eliminating the need for a creator.
6548	Science has not definitively proven the existence of a higher power, so it is possible that a higher power exists that is beyond our current understanding. While this is a possibility, it is far from a proven fact.
6549	Science has not necessarily disproved the existence of a higher power; however, it has provided us with more evidence that rules out a divine creator, as these concepts are harder to prove from an evolutionary standpoint.
6550	No government has ever waged a war in the name of atheism; however, numerous state-sponsored religions have been used to justify wars throughout history, such as the Christian crusades of the Middle Ages.
6551	No state has ever waged a war in the name of atheism, as states generally have their own religious or non-religious belief systems that inform their national policies and actions.
6552	No state or organization has ever waged a war solely in the name of atheism; however, some atheist regimes, such as the Soviet Union during the Cold War, used atheism as a justification for expanding their influence.
6553	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism, nor have there been any major religious conflicts over belief in a higher power, suggesting that atheism itself is not a catalyst for conflict.
6554	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism, but religious conflicts have motivated many wars throughout history. This suggests that atheism, as a belief system, is less likely to lead to violence than religious faiths, which could potentially fuel conflict.
6555	In my opinion, I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline for their children. Spankings can be painful enough to help children learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6556	I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline for their children. While it can be painful for the child, it is a effective way to teach children to avoid doing the wrong things.
6557	I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline for their children, as this can be an effective way of teaching children to avoid certain behaviors. Spankings can have a painful effect on children that can help them learn the lesson sooner.
6558	In my opinion, I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline for their children as punishment can be sufficient enough to deter children from engaging in wrong behaviors.
6559	In my opinion, I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline for their children in order to teach them appropriate behaviors. Spankings can have a punishing effect that is enough to deter children from engaging in wrong actions.
6560	Yes, as children learn more effectively when they are afraid of the consequences of their actions; this can help them remember that if they do something wrong, they will face punishment.
6561	Yes, it is important for children to learn in a way that they remember the consequences of their actions; otherwise, they may be more likely to repeat the same behavior. Therefore, it is essential that they experience appropriate punishment in order to learn the lessons of their actions.
6562	Yes, in order to ensure that the child understands the consequences of their actions, it is important that they learn that there are consequences to every choice they make, and that these consequences can be lasting. This will help them remember the lesson and ensure they make better choices in the future.
6563	Yes, it is important for children to learn in a way that they remember the consequences of their actions. If they know there are negative consequences for doing something wrong, they are more likely to behave in a way that is appropriate.
6564	Yes, as children learn more effectively when they are motivated by the fear of consequences, such as if they do something wrong, they will face consequences such as punishment to help them remember this.
6565	I have been spanked occasionally as a form of discipline for more serious offenses. I think it did more good than harm in my experience. It depends on the parents and child; some forms of discipline may be more effective than others.
6566	I have been spanked occasionally when I have done worse things. I believe it did more good than harm, especially with parents and children. It may be effective in preventing certain behaviors, but it could fail to have the desired effect in other cases.
6567	I have been spanked occasionally as a disciplinary measure in certain cases. I believe it was generally helpful, though again, this depends on the parents and the child. It may serve its purpose, but abuse is never desirable.
6568	I have been spanked occasionally for more serious offenses. I think it did more good than harm in my experience. It depends on the parents and the child; some forms of discipline might be more effective than others, but corporal punishment is never desirable.
6569	I have been spanked occasionally as a form of discipline for misbehavior. I think it was effective, as I have a better understanding of the consequence of my actions now. It depends on the parents and the child; abuse is never the right way to go.
6570	In Christianity, followers are encouraged to live according to a set of moral and ethical values derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ, which can have positive benefits on individuals and society as a whole. Atheism provides no such guidelines, so it is difficult to say what difference it can make. While Christianity can provide a useful set of values to live by, it is up to individuals to choose how to live their lives.
6571	Christianity emphasizes the importance of developing good moral and ethical standards. Atheism offers no such guidance, and it is up to individuals whether or not to follow Christ's teachings. Atheism's lack of belief means it cannot be held up as a better moral standard than any other.
6572	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? It provides the understanding that we are all part of the natural world, and that we should act to protect it and take care of each other, which can be seen as more effective than relying solely on religious teachings. While Christ is a source of inspiration for many, atheism does not have to adhere to a single belief system, allowing for more flexibility in interpreting what is right and wrong.
6573	Christianity emphasizes the importance of morality and ethics, while atheism does not offer any advantages in terms of improving these practices. While Christianity provides a code of conduct to follow, atheism falls short of providing any guiding principles. This makes it more difficult for atheism to make an impact on people compared to Christianity.
6574	Christianity aims to promote better morals and ethics, while atheism has no such contribution to offer. Although Christianity is a belief system, Christ is still a better moral example than atheism, which falls short of many other ideologies.
6575	I believe Islam is the best religion as it provides a balance between divine guidance and human reason. I find this religion most compatible with my beliefs and experiences.
6576	I believe Islam is the best religion as it provides a balance between religion and freedoms, while also providing rules and regulations to follow.
6577	I believe Islam is the best religion as it provides a balance between the spiritual and physical worlds, and its principles provide a framework to lead a morally responsible life.
6578	I believe that Islam is the best religion as it provides a framework of guidance for how to live and provides a pathway to harmony with the Creator.
6579	I believe that Islam is the best religion because it combines the core principles of other faiths, such as Christianity and Atheism, while providing a framework for moral behavior that can be followed and practiced.
6580	This debate shows that there is a strong sense of opinion among many people that religious beliefs should be accepted and respected, as these beliefs can be vital to an individual's sense of identity and belonging. At the same time, it is important to ensure that individuals are not forced to adhere to any particular beliefs, which is why there is a need to ensure religious freedom and tolerance for all.
6581	From a sociological standpoint, these debates highlight the increasing diversity of religious beliefs in society, and the tension between different belief systems. This can cause some conflict as people Melissa of different faiths seek to co-exist in a shared environment. While atheists certainly have a different viewpoint than other belief systems, it is important to respect the freedom of others to worship or not as they choose.
6582	This debate shows that there is a wide range of beliefs and opinions online, and that these can be very different from those of the majority. This can lead to misunderstanding and conflict, especially when it comes to religion, which can lead to a lack of respect and tolerance from some individuals.
6583	There is a long-standing debate about religion and its place in society. While some people are strongly committed to a religious faith, others believe that people should be free to make their own decisions with regard to religion. In some cases, governments may even play a role in Religion. As such, it is important to consider the role of religion in society and its implications.
6584	The debate highlights the diversity of opinions on the internet, as well as the difficulty of establishing a single belief system that works for everyone. While it is important to have a sense of spirituality and community, it is equally important to respect the right of individuals to choose or not choose a religion.
6585	Science has indicated the existence of a higher power, suggesting the possibility of multiple Gods which can be further explored through research.
6586	Science suggests the existence of a higher power, and various theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the universe, suggesting that a higher power is at least feasible.
6587	Science increasingly points to the existence of a higher power, suggesting that a divine force may be at work in the universe. However, which God this force corresponds to is still an open question.
6588	Science has demonstrated that the universe and its laws appear to be fine-tuned for life, suggesting the existence of a higher power. While different faiths interpret this power differently, science offers evidence to support the existence of a higher power.
6589	Science has revealed that the universe appears to have a finite beginning, which points to the existence of a creator. As our understanding of the universe expands, we are able to refine our understanding of the nature of this creator.
6590	In terms of numbers, Christianity is more popular than atheism, but atheism has higher membership numbers in comparison to other religions in terms of its own faith, suggesting it is more popular among younger generations. This suggests that atheism could become more prominent in the future.
6591	Christianity has a larger global following than atheism does, although atheism is gaining in popularity due to greater social acceptance.
6592	I prefer Christianity because its teachings and morals have a greater impact on people's lives, as indicated by congregation size. According to research, the membership of Christian churches is generally larger when compared to atheist groups.
6593	Christianity is the largest religion in the world, with an estimated 2.3 billion followers, while atheism has a much smaller membership, with estimates placing it at around 100 million adherents.

6595	Christianity does offer hope in the world and encourages people to reach out and help those in need, which can lead to a more fulfilling life and a better world overall.
6596	The Christian faith provides hope in the world and encourages people to serve those in need, both physically and spiritually.
6597	Christianity does offer a source of hope and comfort in the world. It teaches that, through faith in Jesus Christ, individuals can have a personal relationship with God and have peace in their lives. Additionally, Christianity emphasizes helping those in need, as illustrated by the command to love one's neighbor and to provide assistance to the poor.
6598	The Christian faith offers hope in the world and encourages people to act to help the poor and marginalized in society.
6599	Christianity does provide hope in the world and encourages people to help the less fortunate, as it emphasizes the importance of caring for others and uplifting those in need.
6600	Having access to technology in school can help give students more opportunities to learn and enhance their education. By taking advantage of programs that make laptop computers available in schools, students can have better access to digital learning materials and resources, which can be beneficial for their learning.
6601	Going to school and investing in a laptop can help one gain knowledge and skills that can open up more opportunities in life. Therefore, by taking the initiative to invest in education and a laptop, God can help one achieve success.
6602	I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can gain access to educational materials and opportunities, such as laptop computers, that will help me reach my academic goals.
6603	God can give us the resources and opportunities we need to succeed, but ultimately, our success is dependent on our own efforts and efforts to reach our goals.
6604	I believe that with hard work and determination, I can obtain a laptop for school. I am willing to take initiative and take steps to acquire one, as I know that God Corps help those who help themselves.
6605	I believe that spanking should only be used as a last resort, and only when other forms of discipline have not been effective. While spanking can be an option in certain situations, it should never be used to the point where the child is being physically harmed.
6606	I believe that spanking should not be the first option, but rather used as a last resort. Spanking should always be done in a manner that is appropriate for the child's age and the situation.
6607	I believe that spanking should be used as a last resort, as physical discipline should always be used carefully and only in extreme situations.
6608	I believe that spanking should be used as a last resort, as discipline should always be used in a way that is appropriate for the age and development of the child. I would avoid spanking the child at all costs if other forms of discipline have not been successful.
6609	I do not believe that spanking should be the primary form of discipline; rather, it should be used as a last resort. Parents should strive to provide positive reinforcement and consistent guidance before using spanking as an option.
6610	Parents play an important role in teaching their children about right and wrong, as children may not always know what is appropriate at an early age.
6611	Parents play an important role in teaching their children what is right and wrong from a young age. This helps children develop their own moral compasses and understand the differences between right and wrong.
6612	It is important for parents to teach children the difference between right and wrong from a young age, so that they can develop healthy moral compasses as they grow.
6613	Because children at a young age may not have the understanding of what is right and wrong, it is the responsibility of the parent to guide them in these decisions by teaching them what is acceptable and what is not.
6614	It is important for parents to teach children from a young age about what is right and wrong, as children may not always know what is correct and incorrect without guidance from their parents.
6615	I believe it should not be done as a form of discipline, as parents can simply scold their child in order to stop them from doing wrong. Physical punishment can hurt a child both emotionally and physically, and children may learn to stop an action out of fear rather than respect for their parents.
6616	I do not believe corporal punishment should be used to discipline a child as this can cause long-term psychological and physical harm. Parents can simply scold their child to help them stop what they are doing wrong, but this is not a viable solution as it can damage the child emotionally and physically. Children are less likely to learn respect for their parents in this way, instead learning to be fearful of repeated punishment.
6617	Nope. I believe disciplining a child should not be done with physical punishment. Parents can reprimand their child instead, as this could help them stop doing the wrong thing without causing physical harm. Children would only learn to be scared of their parents' actions, rather than understanding respect. This would not necessarily lead to a change in their behavior in the long run.
6618	No, I believe it should not be done to discipline a child. Parents could scold their child in order to stop them from doing wrong, but hitting them could cause them emotional and physical harm. This could discourage the child from repeating their actions in the future, but it may not be because they have learned their lesson.
6619	Parents should have the right to discipline their children, but corporal punishment is not the ideal solution. While it can cause physical and emotional trauma to a child, it may also stop the child from engaging in the wrong behavior in the short-term. However, this does not teach respect for the parents and may actually hinder the child from learning the lesson.  Additionally, this could lead to a strained relationship between the child and parent in the future.
6620	It is important to ensure that children feel safe and secure in their environment. Depending on the severity of the offense, there are different forms of punishment that can be given to ensure a child understands the consequences of their actions.
6621	It is important to ensure that children feel safe and secure, and that their physical and emotional needs are met. Therefore, punishments should be tailored to the child's situation, to ensure that they learn the lesson without feeling too much fear or confusion.
6622	It is important to ensure the safety of children and to set boundaries to ensure they understand the consequences of their actions. Depending on the situation, different forms of punishment can be used to teach children the lessons needed.
6623	It is important to ensure that children are safe and protected, and this includes making sure they are not exposed to harm. While it is understandable to want to protect your child, different punishments may be appropriate depending on the situation.
6624	It is important to set boundaries to ensure that children understand the consequences of their actions. Depending on the severity of the situation, different types of punishments could be appropriate for a child.
6625	I would not turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone, I might feel differently about our relationship; it depends on how I feel about the situation.
6626	I would not turn in my spouse if they committed murder, as I would not want my wife to betray me or kill me. If I found out that they had committed a crime, I would be unable to love them in the same way. As I would not be able to love a murderer.
6627	I would not condone my spouse committing murder, as it goes against my moral beliefs. I would feel betrayed if my spouse committed such an act, as I would not be able to love them the same way if they were not the same person I fell in love with.
6628	I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone, I would be unable to stay with her; love is not something that can be forced. I would be unwilling to love a murderer.
6629	I would not stand by my spouse if they committed murder. I could not remain married to someone who had taken another life; I would feel betrayed and as if I could not love that person anymore. I need to be able to trust my partner and feel safe in the relationship.
6630	I am in favor of the ‘no snitching’ rule in general, but when it comes to murder, I would be willing to report it if I heard about it happening. There are usually many reasons why someone would kill another person, but I do not believe the act should be committed.
6631	I'm all about the 'no snitching' rule, but there's a point where I think the law should be enforced. In the case of murder, I would not take any action initially, but I think the crime should be punished.
6632	I believe that murder is a serious crime and should be punished, however, I would first want to know the motive behind the murder as well as the circumstances that led to it. I would be more likely to report it if it were an unexpected crime, as I feel that the crime should be punished.
6633	I agree that murder is a serious crime and should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Initially, I would be hesitant to report it, but I would ultimately make the decision on a case-by-case basis.
6634	I believe that murder is a serious crime and should be punished accordingly. However, I would be more likely to report a murder if it happened near me or my family rather than just hearing about it on the news.
6635	Having some choices are beneficial, but if you had complete control over all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. I have always been in favour of free choice, and yes, I believe abortion should be illegal.
6636	Having some choices can be beneficial, but if you were in control of all the choices in your life, the world would be in chaos. I have always been pro-life, and yes, I believe abortion should be illegal.
6637	Having some choices can be beneficial, but if I had control over all the choices in my life, the world would be in complete chaos. I have always been in favour of a greater sense of personal freedom and autonomy, and yes, I believe abortion laws should remain illegal.
6638	Having some choices can be beneficial, but if you had control over all the choices in your life, the world would be in complete chaos. I have always been in favour of having a sense of personal autonomy, and yes, I believe abortion should be illegal.
6639	Having some choices can be beneficial, but if I had control over all the choices in my life, the world would be in total chaos. I have always been pro-life, and I believe that abortion should be illegal.
6640	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if a procedure to remove something from your body is necessary, it could be difficult to determine if the content has been successfully removed if there is no sense of feeling in the area. Therefore, this could indicate that the content has moved away from the original location.
6641	No one has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if the cells from this tissue move away from the original location, it could pose a threat to the ability to maintain pregnancy, as the body may not be able to recognize it as its own.
6642	It is important to consider what feels right for you regarding your body. Everybody should have the right to make these decisions regarding their own body. However, if an implant can move slightly due to pain, it may no longer be considered part of the body's own tissues.
6643	Everyone has the right to make their own decisions about their body; however, if an abortion is sought after, it is important that the pregnancy is ended safely and that the mother feels no pain during the procedure.
6644	Everyone has the right to make decisions regarding their own body. However, if a procedure is successful in removing a certain tissue or cells, it means that the patient has some form of control over their body, as they are able to feel the effects of the treatment.
6645	Gays should have the same right to marry as heterosexual couples, as marriage is a fundamental right that should be available to all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation.
6646	Gays should have the right to marry just like straight people; all individuals have the right to marry who they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. Everyone should have equal access to the same rights and benefits of marriage, regardless of their identity.
6647	Everyone has the right to marry who they choose, and gay couples should have the same rights as straight couples in this regard. Both straight and gay couples should have the right to marry if they choose to.
6648	Marriage is a fundamental right that should be available to all couples, including same-sex couples. Every couple should have the right to choose how they spend their lives together, including gay couples.
6649	Gay couples should have the same right to marriage as straight couples, as all individuals should have equal access to the legal, social, and financial protections that marriage provides.
6650	I believe that having the egg and spoon race could be beneficial in providing a sense of community and allowing people to interact with one another. Without weapons, it would be easier for people to coexist and prevent violent conflicts. This could lead to more peaceful societies, which would be beneficial for everyone.
6651	I believe that allowing children to participate in such activities can be beneficial as it would give them a sense of ownership, responsibility and empowerment. It would also enable them to interact and work together with others, building valuable social skills. Furthermore, this would give them more freedom to explore their environment and the world around them.
6652	I believe that the egg and spoon race could be an exciting and stimulating activity for children. It could help to foster teamwork and promote cooperation among participants, while giving them an enjoyable shared experience. Moreover, such activities may help to reduce violence and conflict in some areas, as there would be fewer weapons to use as a form of control.
6653	Definately, the egg and spoon race is a great idea! And perhaps we could have other activities such as these to foster a sense of camaraderie among the participants. This could be beneficial in reducing inter-group tensions and providing a sense of control among the population.
6654	I believe that including egg and spoon races in school curriculums could be beneficial, as it would provide children with an opportunity to understand the dynamics of these events and learn cooperation and teamwork. This could help foster a sense of community and competition, as well as provide an outlet for releasing energy in a safe environment.
6655	I believe that donating old clothes is a wonderful way to show charity, as it helps those less fortunate. While selling the clothes to homeless people is an interesting idea, it might not be practical as many charities provide funds through tax write offs which enable them to purchase essential items with the money they receive.
6656	I think it is better to donate old clothes that you no longer want, rather than sell them, as this enables clothing to go to those who need it most. In terms of receiving financial compensation, such as a tax write-off, this can be beneficial for those who itemize deductions on their tax returns. Selling the clothes to homeless people is one option, although the money from begging may enable them to buy clothes.
6657	I believe it is possible to be charitable by donating clothing that one no longer needs, as this allows the clothing to be used by those who need it, while also allowing tax write-offs as compensation. This can be beneficial for both the receiver and the donor. It is also possible to donate to local homeless populations, who often have money from begging or other sources and can thus buy clothing with the money they have.
6658	I believe it is more beneficial to donate old clothes that you no longer need, instead of selling them, as this helps those in need obtain clothing. Charity begins at home and donating clothes to those who need them can be more beneficial than selling them and expecting a tax write-off in return.
6659	I believe that donating used clothes that you no longer want is a generous gesture and can be beneficial financially as well, as you may receive a tax write-off for it. Additionally, selling the clothing to homeless people is one option, as they can often use the money from selling the clothes to buy other necessities.
6660	Amending the Constitution to allow natural born citizenship to be waived could be beneficial. Instead of natural born citizenship, the requirement should be that the individual must be a US citizen for 40 years. This would allow individuals whose parents move to the US when they are younger to have the same opportunities as other kids in the US. It is a worthwhile topic to discuss in more detail and could be further explained with examples.
6661	A good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. Currently, individuals must be 35 years old and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years, but make it so individuals must be a United States citizen for 40 years. This would allow individuals to become president if their parents move to the US when they are younger, providing some flexibility in the requirements.
6662	A constitutional amendment that would modify the requirements to become President would be to lower the age requirement from 35 to 30, and to lengthen the residency and citizenship requirements from 14 years to 40 years. This would ensure that individuals whose parents move to the US when they are younger are given the same opportunities as any other kid in the country.
6663	I believe that the Constitution should be amended to make it possible for individuals who have become US citizens after birth to be eligible for the presidency. Currently, the Constitution states that the President must be a natural born citizen, which some courts have interpreted to mean that the individual must be a citizen of the US from birth. I believe that this requirement should be expanded to include US citizens for 40 years, as this would provide greater flexibility and ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to run for the presidency.
6664	A good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements to become president. Instead of needing to be a natural born citizen, make it so that people must be US citizens for 40 years. This would allow children of parents who move to the US when they are young to have the same opportunities as other kids in the country. It would be a great topic to discuss in more detail, and could easily be expanded upon with examples.
6665	If a citizen attempts murder, they will face imprisonment if the investigation confirms probable cause. Also, citizens are usually granted bail for attempted murder charges, similar to murder charges where bail is often given. I am not sure where you are going with this point.  Attempted murder and murder charges are handled differently in the courts depending on the state, but the process is similar in that an investigation is conducted to ensure all laws and policies were followed.  It seems you may favor more lenient punishment for officers than for citizens in such situations.
6666	They are treated differently because an attempted murder charge carries a more severe penalty than an officer involved shooting charge. Attempted murder also tends to involve greater judicial scrutiny and a longer prison sentence in most states. Murder charges also typically involve greater scrutiny and longer prison sentences. People also get bail for murder charges, so I’m not sure where you are going with that.  Additionally, officer involved shootings are investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed, unlike attempted murder charges.
6667	They are treated differently because attempted murder and an officer involved shooting are completely different things. If a citizen commits attempted murder, he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Also, he gets bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that.   If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent until proven guilty.
6668	They are treated differently because an attempted murder charge carries more severe consequences than an officer-involved shooting charge. With an attempted murder charge, the suspect goes to jail unless they post bail, while in officer-involved shootings, police are typically allowed bail depending on the situation. Additionally, attempted murder charges usually lead to a more severe punishment than murder charges, which also implies that officers are given more leeway when it comes to their shootings.
6669	If a citizen “attempts” murder, they may be incarcerated depending on the details of the case and the determination of probable cause. However, bail is typically offered for murder charges as well as attempted murder charges.  Police officers involved in a shooting on-duty are investigated to ensure that laws and policies were followed.  Again, the officer may still be found innocent until proven guilty.
6670	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This can be beneficial as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account. While investing is a good option, there are other steps to consider, such as taxes and estate planning. Ultimately, how the money is invested and managed is up to the person.
6671	Financial advisors can be beneficial as they allow you to invest your money instead of letting it sit in the bank. This gives you more options with the money, such as investing it. It is up to the individual how to use the money, although the government may have certain rules depending on the inheritance. Ultimately, it is the individual's choice on how to use the money and how to invest it.
6672	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor when it comes to inherited money. This can be beneficial as it allows you to invest the money instead of leaving it in the bank. In terms of what to do with the money, it is up to the individual. Investing is an option, but other options such as spending, managing the money well, and leveraging it are possible. It is up to the individual how to use the money.
6673	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account.  In some cases, the court may require the person to have a financial advisor, depending on the type of inheritance. However, ultimately it is up to the person on how they wish to use the money. There are no other specific steps to take at this point.
6674	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This can be beneficial as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account.  Depending on the situation, the court may require a financial advisor for inheritance matters.  Investing is ultimately up to the individual as to how they want to use the money.  There are no other steps to worry about beyond this.
6675	If you are serious about giving back, consider donating some of your money to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make ends meet, an elderly person on Social Security who cannot afford their electric bill, are all situations that could benefit from your generosity. There are many organizations in your area that could use your support.
6676	If you are serious about wanting to help those in need, you could donate some of the money to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make ends meet, an elderly person relying on social security and unable to afford their electric bill, are all situations that could be helped by a donation. There are many different causes that you can support in your area.
6677	If you are serious about making a difference, you could consider donating some of the money to a worthy cause. For example, you could donate to a children's hospital, an animal protection society or a senior center in your area. There are many things you can do with the money.
6678	If you are serious about making a difference, you could consider donating some of the money to a worthy cause. A young family may struggle to make ends meet, or an elderly person may not be able to afford their electricity bill. There are many different organizations you can donate to, such as children's hospitals, animal protection societies or senior centers in your area.
6679	Consider donating some of the money to a worthy cause if you are serious about it.

6690	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; allowing local governments to decide through ordinances or zoning laws would give them the power to raise revenue to spend on treatments and public health action, while taking away a source of more violent criminal activity. Decriminalization or full legalization of drugs would be beneficial in many ways.
6691	Yes, prostitution should be legalized; local governments should have the authority to decide whether or not it is allowed in their areas. In addition, decriminalization or legalization of drugs could generate revenue for governments which could then be used to fund treatments and public health actions, thus reducing criminal activity. There is no reason why these activities should remain illegal; legality should be enforced.
6692	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized. Local governments should be able to decide whether they want it or not, and they can handle it through ordinances or zoning laws. Same is true for drugs; decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There's no reason these activities should be illegal; the government should have the power to legalize them.

6700	If someone was under oath and admitted to a crime, the Court would be obligated to hold them and begin processing the paperwork. Perjury is punishable by State laws, so it depends on the law of the State where the crime took place. The person would have to be believed since they swore to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
6701	If the person admitted to a crime while under oath and testifying in Court, the Court would be obligated to hold that person in order to begin processing the paperwork.

Perjury is punishable by State laws, depending on the law of the State where the crime was committed. The testimony must be true and the person must have sworn under oath in order for the court to believe them.
6703	Seeing as how there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served. It would be a time-consuming process, but the Court would be obligated to do so. If the person admits to a crime, they would be charged with the crime and punished accordingly. Perjury is punishable according to the state laws. The person would have to suffer the consequences for admitting to a crime they did not commit.
6704	Well, if that someone was under oath and admitted to a crime, the Court would certainly require the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order to serve justice.

Anyone who truthfully admitted to a crime under oath would be believed, as they swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
6705	Yes, we are required to pay income taxes, and we often end up paying more than we owe throughout the year. This is because income taxes are taken out of our wages too late in the year, meaning we have to pay extra to make up the difference. While this can be expensive, we usually get a refund in the spring to help cover any purchases we make with our credit cards or to fund home improvement projects.
6706	What?!? And all these years I've been paying income taxes! We actually OVER-pay each year, and then in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. However, many Americans end up having to pay more in taxes, as not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the year. It can be an expensive burden to shoulder.
6707	What?!? And all these years I've been paying income taxes? We actually usually overpay each year, and then in the spring we usually get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. However, many Americans end up having to pay even more in income taxes, due to not enough being deducted from our wages throughout the year. Ouch!
6708	In the United States, we are required to pay income taxes. Typically, we end up paying more than we owe throughout the year as our earnings are not deducted from our wages during the year. We often get a refund during the spring to help cover any purchases we make with credit cards or to fund home improvement projects. This can be difficult for some Americans who are required to pay more income taxes.
6709	What?!? And all these years I've been paying income taxes - although the amount we pay increases our tax liability, it is usually only a fraction of the total taxes we are required to pay. We usually end up overpaying each year, and then in the spring we get a partial refund to help cover any credit card purchases we make during the year or to fund home improvement projects. It's always nice to get back some of the money that we have put aside.
6710	Even if there are no minors, the language used should attract the people and not distract them.  There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep an "I don't care" attitude. They know that their answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just as speech is an important form of expression, there are a variety of words which appeal to different people. Additionally, it takes some brains to answer a question which they do not have. In addition, it is important to consider the values and ethics of a particular region, as these can differ greatly from one another.
6711	Even if there are no minors, the language you use should attract the people and not distract. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep ‘I don’t care’ kind of attitude. They think that you cannot catch them. They don’t even care to see your reaction. They don’t wait for one. They know well that their answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Moreover, it takes some brains to answer a question which they don’t have. The ethics, values and language should go hand in hand in order to promote a culture of respect.
6712	Even if there are no minors, the language you use should attract the people and not distract them. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people; they believe that even if they do not have the answer, they can choose words which will attract the readers. This gives them an edge in impressing the readers. They know that their answer will not always be chosen as the best, but they can still try to make it the best. People have the freedom to choose the best words which fits their concept. It is also important to consider the values and ethics of the culture when answering a question, as it may help to draw the readers’ attention better. This shows that language has the power to influence the readers.
6713	Even if there are no minors, the language you use should attract the people and not distract them.   There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people. They know that their answer may not be chosen as the best, so they choose words carefully to appeal to the majority.   They understand that words can influence the minds of people and use words strategically to create an appeal.   Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in their approach.   Come on, freedom of speech is also an essential aspect which determines the acceptance of an answer.  Thus, one should be careful with words while answering questions.  Additionally, language helps create an impression which can influence the choice of best answer.  This can also act as a form of self-expression, thereby creating an appeal for the majority.
6714	Even if there are no minors, the language you use should attract the people and not distract them.

Thus, language is an essential element in writing that influences readers.
6715	Is it legal to include religious elements in public education? The answer depends on the religion; however, it is generally recommended that school curricula remain secular, in order to provide a level playing field for all students. Therefore, it is best for religion to be excluded from school learning environments, in order to provide an environment that is fair to all students, regardless of their beliefs.
6716	It is important for schools to provide an education that is inclusive of all students, regardless of their religion. By removing religion from the curriculum, schools are able to provide an environment that focuses on teaching and learning, rather than on prayer or religious instruction.
6717	It is important for schools to offer educational opportunities that are inclusive of all students, including providing courses or activities related to religion. While it is understandable that parents may have particular faiths they would like their children to be exposed to, it is important to remember that school is primarily intended to provide knowledge and skills to help children learn and develop, not to teach religion. In this way, school can be a better environment for children to explore and grow, regardless of their faiths.
6718	It is important for schools to provide educational opportunities for students that allow them to explore a variety of topics. It is true that religion can provide a sense of identity and purpose that is important for students to develop, however, it is the role of schools to provide educational curricula that provides knowledge of various subjects, rather than focus on religion.
6719	Is it legal to push your religion on those who do not believe in it? Schools are there to provide education and access to different points of view, not to promote specific belief systems. It is important for children to have the chance to learn about different beliefs, so that they can make their own decisions on what they believe. As such, it is better to keep religion out of schools, as the education system should be secular.
6720	Well strike the 3rd answer down dude. False imprisonment is something that happens more than you think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. This makes it difficult for defendants to prove their innocence, as the prosecution can hide evidence that proves their innocence. This allows the prosecution to get away with it, as there is usually no way for the innocent person to regain their freedom once it is taken.
6721	In some states, including those that do not have discovery laws, it is possible for the prosecution to conceal evidence that would prove a defendant's innocence, which can lead to wrongful convictions. This puts innocent people at risk of imprisonment.
6722	well strike the 3rd answer down dude.False imprisonment is a common occurrence in states without discovery laws, as prosecutors are able to hide evidence that proves the accused person's innocence. This hinders their ability to defend themselves and can result in wrongful convictions. The southern states are particularly adept at this, which allows them to increase their conviction rates and further their careers.
6723	Well, discovery laws can hinder a prosecution's ability to hide evidence that proves a person's innocence; however, in some states, prosecutors are able to do so by keeping evidence from the defense. This gives the prosecution an unfair advantage in some cases and allows them to get away with these practices.
6724	Well strike the third answer down dude. False imprisonment is something that happens more than people think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. This makes it difficult for the defense to access evidence that could prove innocence as it limits access to crucial evidence. It can also lead to wrongful convictions as the prosecution is able to hide facts that prove the accused person's innocence.
6725	Your odds of successfully suing the other driver are low, as collecting any damages would be difficult. The attorney's fees would likely be high, and even if you win the case, collecting may be challenging as the other driver may not have any assets. You would need to speak to an attorney to better understand your options.
6726	Your odds of receiving compensation are not good due to the limits set by the other party's insurance. Your attorney may be able to file a lawsuit, but it is unlikely that you would collect much. Even if you won the case, you would have to go through garnishments and other procedures. Depending on the state, the attorney's fee is usually 25-40% of the total compensation.
6727	Your attorney may be able to win compensation on your behalf, but it is unlikely that you will collect any funds. If he does not own property or other assets, your attorney may not bother pursuing the case. He may look at your personal auto insurance coverage, which usually covers uninsured motorists if you have it. However, he would have to assess your situation. You also mention $170,000 in medical bills, suggesting that you may not have any personal medical insurance. Your attorney should be able to tell you what you can expect to receive after their fees, which is typically 25-40% depending.
6728	Your odds of collecting anything beyond the policy limits are likely low. Your attorney may sue him, but it is uncertain whether you would be able to collect any damages. Even if you win a lawsuit, collecting payment may be difficult as he does not own any property or other assets. Your insurance may provide uninsured motorist coverage if you have it, but the court would need to determine if you can use it. You indicated you have $170,000 in medical bills, suggesting you do not have any personal medical insurance. Your attorney should be able to give an idea of what you can expect to receive after their fees, which is usually 25-40%.
6729	Your odds of collecting are not good, as attorneys typically only take cases where there is a strong chance of success. It is likely that any award you receive would be subject to garnishments, so even if you win the case, it may not be worth the effort. Additionally, if he does not own any property or other assets, it may be less likely for an attorney to take the case. To collect, you would have to go after him for the money. Your attorney may be able to give you an idea of what to expect in terms of the fee, which is typically 25-40% of any award.
6730	Depending on the crime committed, both death penalty and life imprisonment could be seen as appropriate punishments. However, from a moral perspective, I believe that life imprisonment is a better option as it allows the criminal to reflect on their crime and repent, rather than having the death penalty enforce where life is taken.
6731	I would agree that death penalty should be abolished as it goes against the moral principle that no one has the right to take another person's life. However, I believe that the punishment should be 'corrective' in nature, in order to rehabilitate the criminal and give them a chance to repent. Having said that, imprisonment is generally better than the death penalty in terms of punishment.
6732	I believe that death penalty should not be implemented as it goes against the idea that no one has the right to take another person's life. I feel that the criminal should still have a chance to redeem themselves and go through a form of rehabilitation instead of being imprisoned for life or made to work.
6733	Depending on the crime committed, I believe the punishment should be tailored in a way that the criminal can learn from their mistakes and pay their debt to society. It is better to give the criminal an opportunity to rehabilitate, as life in jail is generally more humane than the death penalty, where the criminal is put to death.
6734	Depending on the crime committed, death penalty is an appropriate punishment in some cases, as it serves as a deterrent and an appropriate punishment for the crime committed. However, I believe that life imprisonment is generally more appropriate as it allows rehabilitation and gives the criminal an opportunity to repent.
6735	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Yes, there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then they are hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive way. That does not mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should not be able to—especially if they are repeat offenders.
6736	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well, there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time, that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive way. Yes, in that case, such individuals should be allowed to vote.
6737	When it comes to voting rights, there are certain requirements that must be fulfilled in order to be eligible to vote. The criteria may vary from country to country, but generally speaking, individuals must be a certain age and must have lived in the country for a certain number of years. Additionally, some countries may require individuals to pass a test on the democratic process and government or show proof of education on the subject. Every country sets its own criteria.
6738	When it comes to voting rights, in order to ensure the integrity of the system, some states require that convicted felons are allowed to vote once they have completed their sentence. This is determined by individual states and requires individuals to meet certain criteria in order to regain the right to vote. There may be exceptions if an individual is deemed a low risk and able to demonstrate good conduct. It is important to take into consideration the rehabilitation of an individual as well as their potential to be an upstanding citizen again.
6739	Yes, generally speaking, there are some crimes that are so severe that people with a criminal record of those types should not be allowed to vote. In some cases, a person might be given the chance to become an upstanding citizen again, such as if they have a record for protesting the war and starting chaos, as long as they have matured and learned to channel their views in a positive way. However, repeat offenders of these types of crimes should not be allowed to vote.
6740	The U.S. has a strong interest in maintaining friendly relations with China, which is a large and rapidly growing market as well as a producer of low-cost consumer goods. However, despite differences in their political structures and human rights records, we are willing to give China a pass since it is important for our economic interests to do so. Cuba, on the other hand, has less to offer economically, so we are more willing to use economic leverage to pursue our interests in the region.
6741	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  Even though the Chinese have a more open economic policy than Cuba, which has restrictions on American companies in certain sectors, we give them a pass as we need China as much as China needs us.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  We can afford to play the bully and assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the region and freeze out the Cubans in order to replace the current government.
6742	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.  Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically.  We can afford to play the bully and keep the Cubans out of the economic equation.  We may still be able to make Cuba the pro-U.S. satellite it was for decades, but it'll take more effort and resources to do so.  Therefore, it may be more feasible for us to just let the Cubans be and find other economic partners in the region.
6743	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc.  Even though the Chinese have a more open and market-oriented economy than Cuba, which has a largely state-controlled economy, China’s growth is seen as a potential long-term opportunity for both countries.  While China is a major trading partner for the U.S., Cuba has very little to offer economically, so we are able to play the bully and ignore China’s interests.  We hope that by doing this, Cuba’s government will eventually change and we can again make Cuba a pro-U.S. satellite.
6744	The U.S. is increasingly reliant on Chinese consumer goods and infrastructure, meaning that stronger ties with China are necessary to balance our economic relationship. At the same time, Cuba has less to offer economically and less access to our markets, making it harder for us to engage with them. We are able to give China a pass due to our need for its economic investments and access to their markets.
6745	When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another.  While freedom of the press allows journalists to publish information without fear of government interference, it does not mean that they are free from legal or other consequences.  Geraldo was ultimately expelled from Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Baghdad before the battle.
6746	When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another. This can mean that journalists have to sacrifice information which could jeopardize an investigation in order to protect a source. As such, journalists must balance the public’s right to know against the impact on a particular case.
6747	When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. In some cases, the court order may compromise one case in order to get information that could help resolve another. For example, when it comes to leaking vital information that could threaten the welfare of the American people, the government may decide that releasing information about the source of the leak is a necessary sacrifice in order to gain knowledge of the leak.
6748	When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another. This means that freedom of the press does not mean that you are free of the consequences; the Government may choose to withhold information that it deems important for national security.
6749	When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. In some instances, a court order can compromise one case in order to resolve another. Additionally, journalists must weigh the consequences of publishing information, as freedom of the press does not grant immunity from such repercussions.
6750	Our constitutional right to privacy was certainly limited in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, it may be necessary to obtain a warrant to eavesdrop in order to ensure the safety of citizens. This is a decision that should be made by the courts and not the executive branch alone. There have been rumors of impropriety by certain members of our government; this is an issue that the people must address to ensure the wellbeing of our nation.
6751	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely restricted in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too difficult for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop in a legal manner. Bush is merely trying to shield himself and other members of our government from scrutiny; there are numerous conspiracy theories surrounding Bush and other members of our government, which I believe is an issue of too much power being concentrated in a few hands.
6752	Our constitutional right to privacy was infringed upon in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I believe it would be possible to obtain a warrant to eavesdrop legally. Bush is acting to protect the interests of the nation, as well as other members of our government. This is a concern shared by many citizens; it is time we take back our government and hold power more closely in check.
6753	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely impacted in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I believe it could get a warrant to eavesdrop in a legal manner. Bush is attempting to shield himself and other government officers, who have selfish intentions in mind. This is an issue that the people of the nation need to take back control of.
6754	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely restricted in this case. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop legally. Bush is just trying to protect himself and other members of our government are doing the same, as there are many conspiracy theories about him and other members of our government. The people of this nation should take back our government before it is too late.
6755	Scott Peterson was the contrast to OJ. He was not a celebrity, instead an 'everyman'. Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stopped there. He and Laci, were physically attractive, which increased viewership. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in ‘Fatal Attraction’; a cautionary tale that Peterson's version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning to us that such an act can have serious consequences.
6756	Scott Peterson was the contrast to OJ Simpson. He was not a celebrity, instead being an “everyman”. Like Simpson, Peterson killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci were attractive and the television images were good, which drew in viewers. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction”. Peterson’s version of reality differed from the norm, leading to his conviction. Though Peterson received a lesser sentence than OJ Simpson, his sentence was still much longer than what an average white male typically receives.
6757	Scott Peterson was a contrast to O.J. Simpson, who was a celebrity. Peterson was an average-looking person, unlike Simpson, but the TV images of the trial were still good due to the similarities between the two cases. Peterson and Laci were aesthetically pleasing, which made the visuals more engaging for viewers. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is pregnant, Peterson's version of reality went off the rails, which was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Do not become complacent and think that life will be fine after the crime; consequences can be severe. 2) Although Peterson's trial garnered much attention, the jury’s verdict still differed based on the individual crimes and the unique circumstances of each case.
6758	Scott Peterson was the antithesis of O.J. Simpson; he was a white man who committed a double homicide, unlike Simpson who was acquitted. Despite the similarities in the crime, the two cases had very different outcomes, as Peterson received the death penalty while Simpson was acquitted. We watch crime dramas to gain insight into real-life situations, as well as to entertain ourselves, and the visuals of Peterson and Laci were good.
6759	Scott Peterson was the contrasting element to OJ Simpson. He was not a celebrity, instead an "everyman," similar to OJ in that respect. Though the similarities end there, the crimes were similar in nature. Both men killed the mothers of their children, though Scott's actions were slightly more severe in terms of the penalty he received. Though the outcome may be different in certain cases depending on a jury's verdict, it is clear that celebrity can have an impact on sentencing.
6760	Disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision. Singapore has enacted laws which provide a balance between protecting society and allowing rehabilitation of offenders, while also taking into account the severity of the crime. The death penalty is just one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.   Additionally, the cost of the death penalty is significantly lower than life in prison, as it eliminates the need for long-term incarceration. This is due to the relatively quick execution process in Singapore compared to the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process which leads to legal maneuvering rather than true justice.
6761	I agree that the decision to maintain or abolish capital punishment should be left to the people of Singapore.  I also believe that low crime rates in Singapore can be attributed to their strong stance against those who seek to undermine society, as well as their tolerance of all cultures and religions and welcoming of diversity.  Furthermore, the death penalty is only one component of the society's belief that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.  Capital punishment in Singapore is more cost-effective than life in prison in the USA, where the appeals process leads to lengthy legal proceedings rather than true justice.
6762	I agree that the decision on whether or not to retain the death penalty should be left to the people of Singapore.  However, the low crime rates in Singapore are in part due to their strict laws and enforcement of these laws.  Singapore is a society that welcomes diversity, while not tolerating those who seek to undermine it.  Additionally, the death penalty is only one component of a society that prioritises protecting the innocent over the guilty.
6763	Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.  The culture and laws of Singapore, which include the death penalty, contribute to the quality of life in the country.  This is due to the belief that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.   However, it is important to note that the death penalty is only one component of the Singaporean society which contributes to the high quality of life.  Other factors such as the tolerance of different cultures and religions, as well as the welcoming of diversity, are also integral to the society's success.
6764	Disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.  In addition, Singapore's low crime rates are due in part to their strict enforcement of laws and the punishments for crimes, which sends a strong message to potential offenders that such actions are not tolerated in the society.  Furthermore, the death penalty is only one component of the legal system in Singapore, which emphasizes protecting innocent citizens over protecting the guilty.  Although the death penalty is more costly than life imprisonment in some countries, this is not necessarily true in all countries.
6765	Be careful. If lawmakers want to truly “defend marriage”, they should strengthen legal protections for couples by introducing measures such as no-fault divorce and laws prohibiting adultery. This could help ensure couples have the necessary legal protection to maintain strong marriages.
6766	Be careful. If institutions like the government are given more control over personal matters, they could potentially infringe on citizens' rights. There needs to be a balance between regulation and protecting personal freedoms.
6767	Be careful. If governments continue to define marriage as they see fit, those policies could change over time. For example, some countries allow same-sex marriage, which could be seen as more acceptable to the government in the future.
6768	Frankly, if they really wanted to “defend marriage”, they should repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a felony. That would “defend marriage” – except half of Congress would be sitting in jail. Marriage is a fundamental right, and the government should not be able to intervene in it lightly without strong reasons.
6769	Be careful. If companies are given greater access to personal data, they may start using it to intrude on individual privacy. This could happen without clear regulations and safeguards in place to protect citizens' data.
6770	The right to access information is an ethical issue that is subject to regulation by the government in accordance with the laws of a country. In China, for example, government policies restrict the information its inhabitants can access. India has domestic rights organizations that are active in protecting and preserving its citizens' rights. Restrictions are often put in place by governments in order to maintain control over the population.
6771	The question of whether people have the right to access information is largely a legal question depending on the laws of their country. In China, for instance, government policies limit the information that its inhabitants can freely receive. In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens' rights, including the right to information.
6772	The extent to which people have these rights is largely dependent on the legal framework of a given country. For example, in China, government policies restrict the information people can access, limiting their freedoms in this regard. In India, domestic rights organizations have been active in upholding citizens’ rights, including information access.
6773	In some countries, laws provide citizens with certain rights, such as access to information, which is determined by the laws of the country. China, for example, has policies in place that limit the information its inhabitants can access. India has domestic rights organizations that work to protect and preserve its citizens' rights in this regard.    Every country usually has restrictions and controls on certain qualities that citizens see as rights. Depending on the political setup, there are those who support more restrictions and those who prefer fewer controls.
6774	In some countries, laws are in place which determine whether people have certain rights to information. For example, China restricts the information its inhabitants can access, depending on the country's laws. India has domestic rights organizations which are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens' rights. Regardless of political party, there are those who support restrictions and those who do not want them.
6775	I understand the concern that racism in admissions can create a feeling of unfairness, as students may feel that they were accepted into college due to their race, even if their test scores and GPA are lower than other students. However, I believe that providing additional financial aid to these students can help counteract this inequality, which can create a more equal education opportunity for them.
6776	I think reverse discrimination can lead to animosity between groups of students, as some may feel they have been given an advantage over others because of their race or ethnicity. This can create a new type of racism or resentment among students who worked harder and were more successful academically but did not get accepted to college due to their score or GPA.
6777	Sure, let's substitute one form of discrimination for another. Now, instead of being proud of what they accomplished, these students may feel that they did not have to work as hard as others to get into college, simply due to their race. This can be an emotional burden that could potentially drive a wedge between these students and their peers. Such instances of discrimination should be avoided, as equality in education is critical to ensuring a level playing field.
6778	I believe that colleges should strive to provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of race. While I believe that diversity is important, I do not believe that students should be awarded positions or money simply because of their race. This could create a feeling of entitlement and create a new type of racism, where students feel that they have been given opportunities they did not earn.
6779	Sure, let's substitute one form of discrimination for another. Now, instead of being proud of what they accomplished, these students may feel that they did not have to work as hard as other people to get into college, due to their race, which can lead to feelings of unfairness and racism. I think this can be damaging to their self-esteem and create an unfair situation.
6780	In the United States, minimum wage jobs are increasingly becoming the only option for those with only a high school education, as wages and benefits in these positions are often better than those available in the broader market. Although these jobs can provide a livable wage and benefits, they are still fewer in number compared to other job opportunities. Additionally, while these jobs provide health insurance and vacation time, paid sick days are not always available.
6781	In many parts of the United States, wages and benefits for jobs are not adequate to support a living wage, which can make it difficult for people without a higher education to enter the labor market. While this is a challenge, workers have access to jobs that pay $20 per hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days. This shows that there are jobs available for those without a college education that pay decent wages and provide benefits.
6782	In some cases, unionized jobs can offer better wages, benefits and working conditions than non-unionized jobs. However, it can be difficult for individuals to enter these professions without a certain level of education and training. This means that often these jobs tend to go to people with more education who can command higher wages.
6783	In many parts of the United States, job opportunities for those with only a high school diploma or less are limited, with median wages for these jobs typically ranging from $10-$15 per hour. However, some industries have begun to offer better wages and benefits, such as health insurance, vacation and paid sick days, for those with less education. This has allowed many people to enter the workforce, providing a much-needed source of income for these individuals.
6784	In many parts of the United States, including rural areas, wages are not high enough to support a living wage, leading to a “skills gap” where employers are unable to find employees with the necessary skills or experience at a reasonable price. This can lead to higher wages being necessary in order to attract workers. This is especially true for more specialized jobs such as health care, where these benefits are offered to draw workers in.  In order to fill these jobs, employers must often look outside of the local area due to a lack of available qualified candidates.
6785	Marriage offers legal protections and safeguards women’s interests in regards to property and raising children, as well as providing support for couples. It serves a purpose in making it more difficult to divorce if couples are not comfortable with the idea of marriage. In some cases, marriage can help reduce the divorce rate.
6786	Marriage can be a useful institution for couples who plan on staying together, raising children, and sharing property; it serves to protect the interests of women and provides a sense of security. It may help lower the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated.
6787	Marriage is a legally binding contract that affords rights and protections to both parties. It provides legal recognition and financial benefits, such as shared property and child custody, that can be beneficial to a marriage if there are children or a shared living community. It serves as a protection for women’s interests in terms of property, and it is better to enter into marriage carefully to reduce the divorce rate.
6788	Marriage is an important legal and social institution that offers legal protection and security for women, especially when it comes to property and children. It is important to consider the benefits of marriage as it can help reduce the divorce rate, for instance, by providing long-term security and stability.
6789	Marriage provides stability and protection for women and children, both emotionally and legally. It can be beneficial for raising children and providing stability, but it is not necessary if couples do not plan on staying together or making a property community. It should be entered into carefully and used only when it provides advantages.
6790	Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in its justice system.  Such punishments are ultimately decided by the government, which could lead to potential bias against certain offenders, depending on the availability of resources.
6791	Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in their justice system.   Where sentencing is decided by humans, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to personal bias or other factors aside from the crime committed.
6792	In societies that place a value on human life and promote non-violent solutions, flooding and capital punishment can be controversial within justice systems. It is possible that innocent people could be imprisoned or executed, depending on the judge’s sentence. Additionally, the better legal representation is available to those with more money, this could lead to inequality.
6793	Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be inconsistent to include flogging and capital punishment in its justice system.   The risk of executing innocent people exists when judgement is made by humans, resulting in a possibility that the poor are disadvantaged.
6794	No matter the justice system, there is a risk that innocent people may be punished. For example, if the punishment is determined by human judgement, there is a possibility that harsher sentences are given according to personal prejudice. Additionally, if capital punishment or corporal punishment is employed, there is a risk that the punishment could be severe even if the offense is minor.
6795	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when it believes it is necessary, as it sees fit in certain matters.  I don't see where this would be any different.  The idea that the Church is the body of Christ is something it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception.  If it shows flaws, misjudgments, or mismanagement, can it still see itself as the body of Christ with its imperfections?  Yes, I believe it can and does exonerate itself in these matters.
6796	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when ever it sees fit on what ever the matter might be.  I believe that the Church, as an institution founded on Christ’s teachings, must maintain a certain level of accountability to ensure its imperfections are addressed. However, I also believe that the Church can and should show grace and forgiveness to its members, as it is part of the body of Christ.
6797	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when it sees fit, which it views as necessary to maintain its identity as the body of Christ. Though it recognizes its flaws, it still sees itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections. Thus, it is able to forgive itself when needed.
6798	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when necessary, allowing room for error and growth. Its authority as the body of Christ does not prevent it from recognizing and addressing its own imperfections. It can and does exonerate itself when necessary.
6799	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself when ever it sees fit on what ever the matter might be.  I believe the Church must recognize its own flaws and imperfections, as all institutions and organizations must do, in order to remain grounded and continue growing. While the Church may try to do this to a certain degree, it is important to acknowledge when it falls short and take steps to improve. It is possible for the Church to recognize its mistakes and learn from them, even if it does not always do so.
6800	It certainly can if you have the right attorney.  Racial remarks are a form of workplace discrimination and the company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it.  The USA has laws in place that prohibits anyone from having to work in a hostile or discriminating environment.  The first step you need to take is to contact the human resource (or personnel) department of your workplace and tell them your story.  You need to write down what was said, the date it was said if you remember, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it.  If the human resource department does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office.  If this option is not available to you, I would consult with an attorney to determine what the next step is you should take.  Be sure to have with you a copy of the complaint, if one was given to you, to take to the attorney.
6801	It can depend on the circumstances. Racial remarks can constitute a form of sexual harassment and the company, the individual and the supervisor could be held liable if the company does not take action to address the situation. You should contact the human resource (or personnel) department first, and if necessary go above their head to the main office. If you feel uncomfortable doing so, consult an attorney to determine the next steps to take.
6802	It can depend on the situation and the company’s policies. Racial remarks can be considered sexual harassment, which is prohibited by law and can result in liability for the company, the person and the supervisor. You should contact the human resources or personnel department of your workplace and inform them of the situation. If this option is not available to you, you should consult an attorney to determine the next step to take.
6803	It can depend on the circumstances of the case. Racial remarks can constitute sexual harassment, which can lead to the company, the supervisor and the person being held liable. You should first contact the human resource department of your workplace and inform them about the situation. If this does not prove to be effective, then you should contact the main office. Make sure to have a copy of the complaint with you when you consult the attorney.
6804	It depends on the state in which you live; each state has its own laws regarding workplace discrimination.  You should contact the human resources department of your workplace, or go above their head if necessary, and inform them of the situation.  If the situation is not remedied, consult an attorney to determine your next steps.  Take a copy of the complaint with you when meeting with the attorney if possible.
6805	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" can make a difference in terms of how the word is perceived. I have noticed that some Black people tend to drop the "er" when saying words, while White people tend to keep it, which can alter the pronunciation of the word. I have been aware of this difference throughout my life.
6806	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" does not make a big difference. I have been aware of this difference all my life, as I have heard my mother and father say the words differently. While I personally do not use it, I recognize that some people use it to avoid looking “corny”. In college, I suggested using a different variation instead.
6807	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" can make a difference in how a word is pronounced, particularly with words that are commonly anglicized. I have been black all my life, and I have noticed that white people tend to pronounce the "er" sound more consistently than Black people do.
6808	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" is no difference. Think about it, Most Black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while white people don't. Therefore, the pronunciation does not take away form the degradation of the word. I have been Black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it. I prefer to emphasize the root of the word, while still pronouncing it correctly.
6809	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" may not make a significant difference in terms of the pronunciation, but many Black people do cut off the "er" from words, while White people tend to keep it. This does affect the degradation of the word. I have been Black all my life and I have noticed this difference.
6810	Annie, I understand your concerns about abortion. I believe that abortion is a difficult issue that can divide people along moral and ethical lines. I think it is important to remember that abortion is legal in many countries and states, and abortion is legal in the United States for a variety of reasons, including to save the life of the woman. While I understand your views on abortion, I believe that the choice should be left to the woman involved, with access to information and counseling to help inform her decision.
6811	I agree that abortion is a difficult issue and that both sides of the argument should be taken into consideration. While I understand that abortion is a personal choice, I feel that abortion should only be allowed in cases where the mother's life is in danger. I also think partial birth abortion is not only murder, but murder by torture and that it should be illegal. I believe that it is important to protect life from conception, which is why I am pro-life.
6812	Annie, I understand your concerns about abortion. I believe that abortion should be legal in certain cases, such as to save the life of the mother, but I also recognize that it is a highly controversial issue. I do not believe that partial birth abortion is murder; instead, I believe it is a matter of personal conscience that should be decided on an individual basis. As for the stereotypes of the pro-life movement, I believe that it is important to respect each other’s differences and recognize that each of us comes to our beliefs through a unique lens.
6813	I understand the importance of having access to abortion services if needed, but I believe that abortion should be allowed only in certain cases, such as to save the mother's life. I also think that partial birth abortion is not only murder, but murder by torture, which is why I am opposed to it. I believe that both sides of the issue have valid points, and that it is important to consider all of them when making a decision.
6814	Annie, I understand your uncertainty towards abortion. I personally believe that abortion should be allowed in certain cases, such as to save the mother's life, but I understand that this is a contentious issue. I think it is important to remember that abortion is not just murder; it is also an incredibly difficult decision for a woman to make.  I believe that it is important to respect a woman's right to choose, and that the government should not intervene in this decision.  Although I understand your viewpoint, I believe that abortion should be legal in certain cases.
6815	Money can be a powerful motivating force in people's lives, particularly when money is perceived as a means to gain more of what someone values. However, money is not inherently evil, as it is possible to love money too much and prioritize it above other things, such as family and friends. Ultimately, the root of evil lies in people's willingness to do whatever it takes to get more money, which is an expression of greed.
6816	Money can be a powerful motivator; however, when people put money above their connection to their higher power, family and friends, it becomes an issue as they prioritize money over these important aspects of their life. People often put money before these things due to a desire to get more of it, which is a sign of greed. Ultimately, love is the greatest force in the world, but money has become an issue in these situations.
6817	Money can be a powerful motivator, as people often prioritize financial gain above other things as it allows them to gain more resources and improve their lives. However, when money is placed before family, friends, and other important relationships, it is a sign of misplaced priority as people put money before their higher power, ultimately leading to greed. Love is the greatest thing in the world, but people often love money more than anything else.
6818	Money can be a powerful force for good in people's lives, but when money is valued above all else, it can lead to problems. People can become so focused on accumulating more wealth that they prioritize it over their relationships, communities and higher power, thus leading to greed. Love, however, is the greatest thing in the world, and money should not take priority over it.
6819	Money can be a motivating factor in achieving success, but it should not be seen as a priority over family, friends, and other relationships. People can become focused on acquiring money, which can lead to greed and a misplaced emphasis on wealth over other aspects of life. Ultimately, love is the greatest thing in the world, and issues of money should be kept in balance with other values.
6820	It depends on the crime. In general, if someone is old enough to commit a serious crime, they should face the consequences of their actions. We must raise our children properly so they understand that some things are wrong regardless of age; certain crimes are particularly severe.
6821	It depends on the crime. Generally, I believe that if a person is old enough to commit a crime considered adult in nature, then they should face the adult consequences. However, if we continue to allow our youth to get away with serious crimes, older criminals will see our youth as a viable target. We need to raise our children correctly so that they understand that some crimes are morally wrong, regardless of the age of the perpetrator.
6822	It depends on the crime. Generally, I believe that if a person is old enough to commit a serious crime, they should face the consequences of their actions. We need to raise our children properly so that they understand that some crimes are wrong, regardless of age.
6823	It depends on the crime. Generally, I believe that if a person is old enough to commit an adult crime, then they should face adult consequences. If we continue to allow younger generations to get away with serious crimes, older offenders will continue to get away with it. We must raise our children properly so they understand that certain actions are wrong regardless of the age of the perpetrator.
6824	It depends on the crime. In general, I believe that if someone is old enough to commit an adult crime, they should face adult consequences. However, if we continue to allow our youth to get away with serious crimes, more serious crimes could be committed by older people. We need to raise our children correctly so they understand the consequences of their actions, even if they are minors. Some crimes are morally wrong regardless of the age of the perpetrator.
6825	If you are served with court papers, it is important to notify the court of the service as soon as possible.  Depending on the court’s rules, a hearing may be scheduled for a later date, even if you have not been personally served.  It is important to attend the hearing and be prepared for the court’s ruling.
6826	If you have been served with papers, it is best to attend the hearing.  If you haven't been served, it is still a good idea to go to the hearing to ensure that all the proper procedures are followed.  You should contact the court to determine the details of the hearing.
6827	If you have been served with court papers, it is best to contact the court immediately.  However, you may still be able to avoid a court hearing if you take quick action and prepare for it properly.  It is better to be proactive and be present in court if required rather than risk an adverse ruling that could be difficult to reverse.
6828	It is important to remain informed of the court proceedings in a divorce case. If you have not been served with papers, it is wise to stay informed of the situation and determine if a hearing is scheduled for Friday. Even if a hearing has not been set yet, it is best to be prepared by attending if possible.
6829	If you have been served with court papers, it is important to attend the court hearing as soon as possible.  Even if you have not been served, it is a good idea to go to the court hearing on Friday to ensure that you are prepared for any potential outcomes.  It would be better to be present in court if necessary, rather than risk a negative ruling that may be difficult to reverse.
6830	Youtube could help Twitch with their streaming issues, leading to better performance, which would benefit users. Youtubers may get more exposure, making Youtube bigger and having a wider audience. There are positives for Youtube taking over Twitch in terms of promotional opportunities for channels and better performance.
6831	Youtube is a vast video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where viewers mainly watch someone playing a game.   If Youtube were to take over Twitch, it could help with the server load, thus improving the user experience. Additionally, Youtubers could receive assistance with streaming and this could help promote their channel.   Youtube could also become bigger over time and cater to a wider audience. This could further increase its user base.   In the past, I have been uncertain of some of the changes that have happened to Youtube, such as the Google+ integration. However, I do not foresee any major downsides to Youtube taking over Twitch.
6832	Twitch is a popular streaming platform where viewers watch someone playing a game, whereas YouTube is a larger video platform which hosts a variety of videos. If YouTube were to take over Twitch, it would help with the server load which would improve the speed of the platform. This is just my speculation, but it could help promote channels as well as attract a wider audience, leading to bigger growth for YouTube. Additionally, I cannot see any downsides to this taking over of Twitch.
6833	Youtube has the potential to help Twitch with its servers and streaming, which would improve the user experience. This could help promote Youtube channels and make the platform bigger. Furthermore, Youtube could provide better services to a wider audience, which would boost its own popularity. I believe the integration with Youtube and Google+ in the past has been mostly positive for users.
6834	YouTube's acquisition of Twitch could be beneficial for both companies, as it would significantly reduce server loading times, potentially allowing Twitch to run faster. Additionally, YouTube's increased reach could help promote the channel and widen its audience, leading to larger viewership. Moreover, I believe that YouTube's ownership of Twitch could be beneficial for users, as there are very few downsides that could occur.
6835	The government does have the right idea that teenagers should not have access to alcohol at an early age. However, 18 is too young to lower the drinking age, as this could potentially deny high school students from celebrating the major milestone of 20th birthday. 21 is a more appropriate age, in my view, as it allows individuals to fully appreciate the significance of the event.
6836	The current drinking age of 21 can be seen as a barrier to teenagers celebrating the major milestone of 21st birthdays, as most people celebrate the age with a glass of champagne or a beer. Although some may argue that it gives teenagers access to alcohol too soon, I believe that 18 is too low an age to deny teenagers this right, as 18 is generally considered the legal adult age in most countries. Therefore,
6837	The government does have the right idea that teenagers should not have access to alcohol until they reach legal adulthood, but in my view, 18 is too young to drink alcohol. Moreover, the legal drinking age of 21 undermines the significance of 20-year-olds’ life events, such as graduating from high school and entering adulthood. Instead of celebrating, most people just pass their 20th birthdays, waiting for the extra year.
6838	The current drinking age of 21 has a significant impact on young adults, as it denies them the chance to legally drink alcohol until they reach 21. This could reduce the significance of turning 21, which is an important milestone in a person’s life. In my view, the legal drinking age should be set at 18, allowing young adults to access alcohol with appropriate regulation.
6839	The government does have the right idea that teenagers should not have access to alcohol at a young age; however, 18 could be too low an age, as it would take away from the importance of a 20th birthday, which marks a major life stage. I believe that 21 is a reasonable age, as it gives teenagers time to enjoy their newfound freedom in the lead up to the event.
6840	In the UK, every few years the government’s Cabinet has a reshuffle, where the minister in charge of education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. This can make it difficult for the public to retain trust in the system, as the minister is changing jobs with little opportunity to evaluate their expertise. Instead, elections should be held wherein academics in each relevant field (nominated by the parties) compete for the position, allowing for greater public oversight.
6841	In the UK, every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle where ministers in charge of education may move to become ministers in charge of transport or healthcare.  This can be confusing for the public as there is no guarantee that the new minister has the required experience and expertise in their chosen field.  This could be improved by holding elections where subject matter experts in each relevant field (nominated by the parties) are voted into office.
6842	In the UK, every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the Minister in charge of, for example, education may move to become Minister in charge of transport. This can make it difficult for the public to maintain trust in the government's policies in key areas, such as education. This system could be improved if elections were held where nominated academics, selected by one of the political parties, competed for these positions to ensure public trust and understanding.
6843	In the UK, every few years the government’s Cabinet has a reshuffle, where the minister in charge of education may move to become the minister in charge of transport. This could make more sense if elections were held every few years, where subject matter experts in each relevant field (nominated by the parties) competed for the posts, rather than a career politician switching roles suddenly.
6844	In the UK, every few years the government's Cabinet undergoes a reshuffle, where the minister in charge of education may move to become minister in charge of transport. Surely, it would be more sensible if every few years, Education-specific expertise was sought through an election, where nominated experts in each relevant field, chosen by the parties, competed for the position? This would enable continuity between departments, while still enabling ministers to have the opportunity to switch roles.
6845	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or a bad start in life. However, the majority of people in poorer households in the US do not have equal opportunities to gain education and skills needed to succeed. I come from a poor family and am currently in college, and I understand that the world we live in does not make it easy. We have to work hard to attain our goals.
6846	I understand that there are many people in poverty who may have mental or physical health issues, a bad start in life, or who lack access to educational and career opportunities. While this is true for some, the majority of Americans are content with their current situation and do not want to put in the effort needed to move up in society. I come from a similar background and am now in college, and it is difficult to remember that the world we live in does not work that way. We must work for our success.
6847	I come from a poor family and am in college now. I understand that the world we live in does not provide easy opportunities, but I have to put in the effort to get what I want. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, as people in developing countries have to work hard to survive while we have grown up with video games and easy schooling.
6848	I recognize that many poor Americans may feel content with their situation, as education and access to opportunities can be limited. However, I believe that with greater investment, Americans can be given more chances to move up in society. It is important to note that the society we have created has made us soft, as access to video games and easier education have made it easier for us to opt out of effort. Additionally, conditions in third world countries require people to work hard for survival, whereas we in the US have become accustomed to this easier lifestyle.
6849	I agree that there are many people in America who are content with their lifestyle and do not want to put in the effort required to move up in society. While I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to reach their full potential, the society we have created can make it more difficult for people to move up the economic ladder. It is important to remember that the world we live in has created obstacles that make it more difficult for us to succeed.
6850	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must gather in the stadium and wait for the arrival of police and a bomb squad. However, this could pose a risk, as terrorists could easily find out about this procedure through the school's website and plant a bomb in the stadium, potentially leading to the death of everyone.    It would be more sensible for me to get in my car and leave campus, as I would have the chance to save my life in such situations. Knowing if a threat is real or not would depend on the situation, as the school notifies students of the details of the threat.
6851	My school has a policy of gathering students and staff together in a single location, such as a stadium, in the event of a bomb threat. However, this could put everyone in danger if a bomb is planted in the stadium, as the terrorist could find out about the policy via the school's website and plant a bomb. To save my life, I would rather run to my car and leave the premises. Knowing the details of the threat would make all the difference.
6852	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must gather in our stadium and wait for police and a bomb squad to arrive. This could pose a risk as terrorists (or whoever) could discover this information and plant a bomb in the stadium, potentially leading to the death of everyone in attendance.    I believe it would be better to leave the school premises and drive to my car, which is off campus, if I perceive a threat. Knowing if it is a real threat or not is reassuring, as I could decide to flee if necessary.
6853	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must gather in a designated area, such as a stadium, until law enforcement and a bomb squad arrive. This information is generally listed on the school’s website and could put students and staff at risk if a bomb is planted in the stadium, as I could be killed in such an event.    While it is possible to evacuate to my car if I am in danger, it is better to save my life 100% of the time. Additionally, I can tell if a drill is taking place that day, allowing me to take the appropriate action.
6854	My school has a policy of gathering the entire student body and staff in a stadium if there is a bomb threat, which could pose a potential danger. However, I would be able to know if it is a legitimate threat due to the fact that the school informs us whether there is a drill or not that day. I would be able to escape in such a situation to save my life 100% of the time.
6855	Public officials are often elected, but the process is not very transparent or verifiable by most voters. They rarely face any penalties for making laws that others have sworn to enforce. This also applies to the enforcers. If the officials experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that usually happens to them is losing the next election. In very rare cases, they may spend some months in jail. Generally, the punishments are lenient compared to what ordinary citizens face.  Public officials often take advantage of ample opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which favor the special interests. The officials then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, in addition to numerous other kickbacks, such as lucrative “consulting” gigs. This is largely accepted by the public as the norm, which may be due to people being unaware of the mechanisms of this political machine.
6856	The ability of public officials to influence legislation is a concern, as it can lead to laws that benefit particular interests instead of the public good. While voters may not be able to directly monitor this process, the laws passed are still ultimately enforceable by the public. Generally, those officials face few consequences for their actions, even if it leads to scandals, unless it is serious enough to result in them being removed from office. Special interests may donate money to the officials to influence laws in their favor, which the officials can then use to invest in companies that are protected from competition, as well as numerous other forms of compensation, such as consulting gigs. This is something that the public may be unaware of, as it takes place behind closed doors.
6857	Though the process of electing public officials is not always fully transparent or verifiable by most voters, they rarely face penalties for making bad laws that others must enforce. This can occur more often if the candidates face a re-election challenge. If the officials do experience scandal, they may face relatively light punishments such as a few months in jail; however, for those not in positions of power, prison sentences are much more common. It is possible that these officials receive donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which benefit them, which the officials then go on to invest in. The officials may also take on various lucrative “consulting” jobs in addition to this. This is generally accepted by the public as a regular occurrence, though citizens may be unaware of the full extent of the system.
6858	While some politicians may be able to influence legislation in ways that favor special interests, the public is generally not aware of the full scope of these exchanges due to a lack of transparency. Additionally, the punishments faced by elected officials for enacting laws that are unpopular are usually minor compared to the risk of losing an election. In some cases, officials may even receive preferential treatment in prison if they are convicted.
6859	In some instances, public officials may be elected, although the process is far from transparent and verifiable by most voters. Generally, officials rarely face any consequences for making laws that others have sworn to enforce. Additionally, if they do experience scandal due to their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election. In rare cases, they may spend some months in prison. Public officials often have the opportunity to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws that favor the special interests. Afterwards, these officials can continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, as well as numerous other types of kickbacks, such as consulting gigs. Why are people generally tolerant of this? Are they just unaware of the mechanism of this political machine?
6860	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, leagues strive to ensure that parity is maintained or enhanced. This is because fans enjoy the excitement of seeing a competitive title race, where any team has the potential to win the championship. This creates more interest in the games and increased viewership, which boosts the popularity of the league.
6861	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.   I believe that parity is important to make games more interesting and exciting for fans. It is beneficial for teams to have equal opportunities to rise up the rankings and create more suspense, especially in the case of La Liga, where Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid are often competing against each other. This makes games more attractive to viewers, since there is more suspense in these matchups than in games between two middle-of-the-pack teams.
6862	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, it is important to balance the need to maintain or enhance parity.  It is true that when there are more teams vying for the championship, the matches between these teams can draw more viewers, providing an incentive for teams to be competitive with each other. However, this does not mean that a lack of parity between teams is preferred over a few teams being great and exciting to watch, as this could limit the viewership of the matches.
6863	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, one of the primary considerations is how parity can be maintained or enhanced. This can be done in several ways, such as by ensuring that teams are not consistently relegated or promoted. This ensures that each team has an equal chance of succeeding over time. Additionally, promoting teams up and down based on their performance helps ensure that the level of competition remains relatively consistent.
6864	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, there is a balance to be struck between maintaining or enhancing parity.  In general, a handful of strong teams provide the most excitement for fans, as this creates a competitive balance that draws in viewers. However, there is potential that enhanced parity could draw in more viewers even if the teams are not top contenders.
6865	I have never had an issue with this in a shared bathroom situation, as I believe it is important to respect the space of other users. However, if the bathroom is shared between males and females, it could become an issue if the male user needs to use the toilet first and the female user needs to use it later. In this situation, the male user would need to put the seat up again. This could become an issue in large buildings or households, where there may be long waits between uses.
6866	Granted I have never had any issues with this in a shared bathroom, as I always check that the toilet seat is down after I use it. However, this could be problematic if there are multiple users of the same bathroom. This could lead to conflicts over who checks the toilet seat and who puts it down, which could be inconvenient for everyone.
6867	Granted I have not had this issue personally, as I have not experienced it myself. However, I understand that this can be an issue in shared living spaces, as it is the case in offices and shared homes. While I understand the need for cleanliness and upkeep, this can be a challenge when sharing a toilet with others.
6868	Granted, I have never had any trouble with this issue when using a public restroom with another person. However, when staying with a female friend, who wishes to maintain the toilet in a certain way, I can understand her feeling.   Putting the seat up after use can be inconvenient, as it does not necessarily mean that the toilet is not used by another person afterwards. In large buildings or households, the next person to use the toilet could be of the opposite sex, in which case the person needs to look before using it. Additionally, female users may feel more comfortable looking before use.
6869	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend (the later of which I understand because it's her house and she wants it maintained a certain way).   The argument is that it's considerate to put the seat up after use so that the next person to use the toilet doesn't have to, but this cancels out the point of having a seat that can be quickly put back up. To prevent this, I think it's best to either keep the seat in a designated place or use a latch mechanism that locks the seat in place.    In a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Thus, the need to put the seat up after use is further emphasized.
6870	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. While I am undecided on my opinion of the death penalty, I believe that it can be a form of societal retaliation, similar to how public display of bodies after execution was used in the past to inform society about the consequences of sentencing someone to death. Public knowledge of this could change beliefs about the death penalty.
6871	I believe the death penalty is a matter best left to the discretion of the government, as it can serve as a form of retribution for society in some cases. Nevertheless, the public should have access to information about what execution in the United States is like, as this may ultimately shape beliefs on the death penalty.
6872	I understand why some people feel the death penalty should be enforced more often, as a form of retaliation for society. However, I am undecided on my personal opinion of the death penalty. Personally, I think it is important to make sure as many people as possible are aware of what sentencing someone to death entails, so that our society's beliefs can be changed.
6873	I believe that the death penalty can serve as a form of retaliation by society, as it has been used in the past. However, I am unsure if this is desirable, as execution in the United States could alter people's beliefs about the death penalty. It could also provide more information to the public about what executions involve.
6874	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty needs to be enforced more often. I, personally, am undecided on my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a societal form of retaliation (much the way that putting someone's head on a pike was used in the past). If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).
6875	In my opinion, the public has a right to know about crime and violence, but should not reveal the names of the perpetrators unless it is a matter of security (the perpetrator is either at large or imprisoned). I personally feel that announcing the names of criminals involved in a murder-suicide case can increase the risk of similar crimes getting media attention, so the events should not be covered up, but the names should be kept confidential.
6876	I believe that the public has a right to know about crimes such as murder, robbery and assault, however, the names of perpetrators should be kept confidential unless it is a matter of security, such as when a criminal is at large or in prison. I personally feel that releasing the names of perpetrators in murder/suicide cases could lead to copycat crimes and should be avoided.
6877	I believe that the public has a right to know about crimes, such as murders and robberies, however, I believe that the names of the perpetrators should not be released to the general public, except in cases where the perpetrator is still at large or imprisoned. I feel that this could potentially motivate other criminals to commit similar crimes for media attention, and thus the specific names of criminals should be kept from the public.
6878	I believe the public has the right to know about crimes, such as murders and robberies, but that the names of the perpetrators should not be released to the general public, unless it is a matter of security (e.g. the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned). In my opinion, disclosing the names of criminals involved in a murder-suicide case can lead to copycat crimes, so it should be kept confidential.
6879	I believe that the public has the right to know about such crimes, however, the names of the perpetrators should not be released to the public, especially in murder/suicide cases, as this may lead to similar crimes being committed for media attention.
6880	It is true that we are just beginning to gain a more thorough understanding of how climate change will impact the Earth. While the current predictions of drought and higher ocean levels offer an indication of what the future could hold, the more nuanced insights are sparse and will take more time to become clear.
6881	It is becoming increasingly clear that climate change could have a significant impact on our world over the coming decades and centuries, and while we have a basic understanding of some of the consequences, the full picture remains unclear.
6882	It is true that the more we learn about climate change, the more it seems that we have only just begun to understand how the Earth's systems work and interact. Even though some predictions have been made, such as more droughts and higher ocean levels, we have a limited understanding of what life will be like in the coming decades and centuries. We must keep exploring the nuances of climate change to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the possible scenarios.
6883	It is true that we are still learning about climate change and how the Earth's systems interact. While we have a general understanding of some potential effects, such as more drought and higher ocean levels, it is the more subtle insights which remain scant. Understanding the future is difficult at this point, and we must be conservative in our predictions.
6884	It is clear that climate change poses a unique and growing threat to our planet. While we have learned much about the consequences it will bring, such as increased drought, higher ocean levels, and more, we still lack a more detailed understanding of the future of the planet. It is essential that we gain more insight into these effects to make informed predictions about the world in coming decades and centuries.
6885	I used to always stand to pee, but I found it easier and more convenient to sit while I brush my teeth. This has gradually evolved over time, and now I often sit to pee if I'm feeling lazy or if I have morning wood and need to tuck my dick under the toilet seat. I do this about half of the time. It has nothing to do with being gay, as it does not involve any sort of sexuality.
6886	I have gradually started to sit while I urinate due to convenience. It depends on the situation; I might sit if I'm feeling lazy or if I have morning wood and need to tuck my dick under the toilet seat. I used to stand when I urinated, but I find sitting more comfortable. I do it about half the time. It does not have to do with sexuality, so I have not told anyone about it yet.
6887	I have begun to sit while I urinate more often. I find it more convenient and comfortable, and I believe it is an acceptable and personal choice. It does not have to do with my gender, and I do it for the convenience and comfort. I usually do it half the time.
6888	I often multi-task when I go to the bathroom, especially when I'm feeling lazy or the urge to go is sudden. I often sit to go when I have morning wood or when the feeling to go is sudden. This has nothing to do with gender, and I rarely tell anyone about it because of the stigma attached to it.
6889	I have begun to sit while I urinate more often, as it saves time compared to standing. It also depends on the situation. I tend to sit more if I am in a rush or if I am feeling lazy. It does not matter if I am feeling tired or not, I will still choose to sit if it is more convenient.
6890	I'm a young male, 19 years old. I am considering having rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation procedures. I think this will make me look much better and attract more attention from women. I believe this will boost my confidence and make me feel more attractive, which will help me enter male modeling and travel more.
6891	I'm a young male (19) and I am considering rhinoplasty, chin, jaw, and cheek augmentation. I believe that after the procedures, I will become more attractive, which will boost my confidence and make me more approachable to girls. Additionally, I believe it will open up opportunities for me to enter male modeling, which I find quite interesting and gives me the chance to meet new people and travel more.
6892	I'm a young male (19) and I'm considering having a rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I feel that the procedures will make me look much better and boost my confidence to approach girls and make new experiences. I also think that having a better face and body will open opportunities for me in male modeling, which would give me the chance to meet new people and travel more.
6893	I am a 19-year-old male and I am considering undergoing a rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I believe that these procedures will significantly improve my attractiveness and self-confidence, which will make it easier for me to approach girls and even get into male modeling, an opportunity that I find very interesting and enjoyable.
6894	I am 19 years old and considering rhinoplasty, cheek and jaw augmentation as well as building a stronger body, which I believe will help me get into male modeling and give me the opportunity to meet new people and travel more. I believe that once these procedures are done, I will become much more attractive and confidence will be boosted when approaching girls. This will definitely change my view of myself.
6895	Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold than too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle.
6896	Get over here...the most underrated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold vs too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the majority of his rivals. If anything, Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete game changer. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
6897	Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold versus too hot. Sub-zero has a wider range of moves that outclass most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and being able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete usage of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
6898	I would choose to stay cooler rather than warmer since being too cold is often preferable to being too hot. Sub-zero has a wider range of moves than his rivals, as he is able to freeze opponents and objects from thin air, as well as being able to walk on ice and climb walls. I believe Sub-zero has a better body temperature which is likely lower than the average ninja, making him more flexible in battle.
6899	Get over here...the most underrated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold vs too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that outmatch the majority of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete game-changer. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
6900	I have some concern about the concept of “rape culture”; while it is true that we live in a safer time than ever before in terms of crime rates, the prevalence of violent crime is still higher than it has been in the past. At the same time, information is more accessible than ever before, allowing us to be aware of every violent crime that takes place worldwide. While it is important to educate males on the consequences of rape, it is important to remember that rape is not inherently a part of the Y chromosome.
6901	I have some reservations about the “rape culture” narrative. We live in a safer time than ever before; violence rates are at an all-time low. At the same time, with the prevalence of the internet, we have the ability to hear about every single violent crime that takes place around the world at any given moment. While it is important to teach children about the potential dangers of violence, it is also essential to reinforce that rape is wrong.
6902	I think we need to teach both men and women about the importance of respecting each other's boundaries and the potential consequences of violating them. The idea that rape is something that is learned, rather than hardwired, is important to understand. We can teach people that rape is wrong and what actions are appropriate in certain situations.
6903	I believe that today, rape is actually less common than it has ever been, due to improved safety and greater awareness of these crimes. However, while we are better informed about violent crimes than ever before, the notion that these types of crimes could be ingrained in the Y chromosome is a false one. It is important that men are taught respect for women from an early age to help prevent these crimes.
6904	I personally have some doubts about the ‘rape culture’ concept. We live in a safer time than ever before. The chances of being a victim of a violent crime are lower than they have ever been. Nevertheless, the internet allows us to hear about all violent crimes that take place around the world at any given moment.   I do think it is important to teach boys that rape is wrong and that violence against women is not acceptable.
6905	I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly half my life we have been at war with al Qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contracts at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens.  It appears that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of “terrorism”, thereby creating a never-ending war.  This war has gone on for generations, predating 9/11 and showing that terrorism has been a threat for thousands of years.  In my opinion, this is a political tool used by the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people and electing the most hawkish neo-con into office, thus allowing the military industrial complex to spend even more money on these wars.
6906	I'm 30, and it seems like for much of my life we have been at war with al Qaeda/terrorism in the name of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contracts at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens.  It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of “terrorism” so in theory the “war” would never end since there will always be “terrorism” in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).  It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.  To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
6907	I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly half my life we have been at war with al Qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and shifting a huge amount of GDP into military contractors at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens.  It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back thousands of years...).

To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
6908	I’m 30, and it seems like for much of my life, our government has been at war with terrorism and other countries in order to maintain our own security. This “war” has been used as a justification for increasing military spending and engaging in military adventurism, which has come at a significant cost to our economy and citizens. It seems like the potential for this conflict never ending, as terrorism has existed for centuries and will continue to do so. Additionally, it appears to be a political tool used by the right to scare people into increased military spending and weaken social programs, as well as increasing the power of the military-industrial complex.
6909	I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly half my life, our government has been at war with al Qaeda and terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and shifting a substantial amount of GDP into military contractors at the cost of using that GDP to help our own citizens.  It appears to me that the military industrial complex has used 9/11 as an excuse to remain at war with a very generic concept of terrorism, which would seem to extend indefinitely due to the fact that terrorism has existed for centuries.  It also appears to be a political tool of the right wing to scare old, white conservatives into voting for hawkish neo-cons who are keen on spending even more money on military adventurism, in line with Dwight D. Eisenhower's warnings.
6910	I smoke American Spirits occasionally when I am feeling stressed. Although I know cigarettes can be harmful, I tend to believe that the harm is lower since they only contain tobacco.
6911	I smoke American Spirits occasionally. I usually buy a pack maybe 5 times a year. In times of stress, I turn to smoking due to the familiarity and sense of relaxation I get from it. To me, I think it's just the harm of smoking which is not ideal, but it's a better option than consuming alcohol or other drugs.
6912	I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack once or twice a year in times of stress. To me, I think American Spirits are a reasonable option as they contain tobacco which is the harm of smoking, compared to cigarettes which contain additives.
6913	I smoke occasionally, usually only a pack or two a year. This time it was stress-related; I tend to turn to smoking when I need a break from things. To me, smoking American Spirits is not as bad as regular cigarettes since they mainly contain tobacco. It is still smoking, which is not good, but it's better than other options.
6914	I smoke occasionally, usually only buying a pack a few times a year when I am stressed. To me, American Spirits seem less harmful than smoking as there is no added flavoring or chemicals. Though it is still smoking, which is not ideal, I believe it is a better option when I need to relax.
6915	I have experience four different educational methods. The common problem with all of them is that they focus on memorization instead of understanding the concepts taught. I think schools should give students more flexibility in choosing their classes. Some students may not be good at certain subjects and schools should be able to customize the curriculum according to the student's interests. Economics should be a priority in the school's schedule as many financial crisis are caused by lack of economic knowledge and skills.
6916	I have attended multiple schools and my experience is that the education system generally focuses more on memorization than understanding concepts. I think schools should offer students the opportunity to choose their classes. Some students may have no interest in certain subjects, so classes can be taken out of the schedule depending on the student’s interests. Economics should be given a higher priority in the curriculum to equip students with economic knowledge.
6917	I have experienced four types of schooling. The main issue with all of them is that they focus more on memorization instead understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have learned more from reading, personally.  I believe schools should provide students more flexibility in choosing their classes. Depending on the student, some classes may not be relevant, while others may be of interest. Economics should be given a priority spot in the schedule, as many foreclosures occur due to a lack of understanding of economics and dependence on others to manage money.
6918	I have experienced four different education systems. The main issue with all of them is that they focus on memorization rather than understanding the concepts taught. I have learned much more from self-study than schooling.  I believe schools should provide students with the opportunity to choose their classes. Depending on the student, some classes may not be necessary, while others may be. Economics should be a priority in the school's schedule, as many house foreclosures are due to a lack of knowledge of economics and relying on others to manage one's money.
6919	I have experienced four different styles of education. The problem with all of them is that they focus on memorization rather than understanding the concepts taught. I have learned more from self-study than in any of these settings. Schools should offer students more choice in their schedules and make Economics a priority. In addition, Economics plays a key role in preventing house foreclosures, as people need to have a better grasp of economics to manage their money.
6920	In most cases, punishments are consistent with what is fair, depending on the circumstances. This can be influenced by connections between various parties, such as prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, etc. Having an advantage over the other party can give a person success.
6921	In most cases, the punishment for a crime is determined based on what is considered fair, which is partly dependent on connections between the various actors in the court system, such as prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges. It is difficult to succeed in a legal case without some sort of advantage.
6922	If a person's guilt or innocence is clear in most cases, the punishment they receive will be consistent with what is fair. This can depend on connections between different parties in the legal system, such as prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and so on. However, having an advantage over other people can give a person success.
6923	The punishment or lack thereof for a crime is often determined by the connections between the parties involved, such as between prosecutors and defense, prosecutors and judges, and defense and judges. Having an advantage over the other party is key to success in these situations.
6924	In most cases, punishments are determined based on what is seen as fair, which is often influenced by connections between the parties involved, such as prosecutors, defense, judges and others. This makes it difficult to predict success, as it is ultimately dependent on having some kind of advantage over the other parties. I believe that the best way to succeed is to have an edge over the other parties.
6925	Europe, in physical geography terms, is not a continent but rather a cultural region. While some may argue for the Ural Mountains as a barrier from a satellite view, no other continents are divided by a single mountain range. Continents are typically divided by vast oceans and seas. European countries have their own distinct cultural identity and history which is why they prefer to be seen as a separate continent.
6926	In physical geography terms, Europe is not a continent but a cultural realm. There is no major physical barrier separating Europe and Asia; the Ural Mountains are the only division seen from a satellite view. Europe is not divided into distinct continents, as continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. It is clear that Europeans desired to be seen as a distinct continent for historical, social and political reasons.
6927	Europe in physical geography terms is not a continent; rather, it is a cultural region. While some may argue for the Ural Mountains as a dividing point when viewed from a satellite perspective, no other continents are divided by a single mountain range. Continents are divided by vast oceans and seas.  Europeans have a historical connection to their own continent, and the separation from Asia was preferred by the Europeans themselves.
6928	Europe is not considered a physical continent in terms of geography, but rather a cultural realm. There is no significant divide between Europe and Asia, according to a satellite view. Continents are separated by vast oceans and seas. Some argue that Europeans wanted to be considered their own physical continent due to cultural and political reasons.
6929	Europe, in physical geography terms, is not a continent but a cultural region. There is no major division between Europe and Asia, as some argue the Ural Mountains are a barrier when viewed from a satellite perspective; however, continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. European powers wanted to be considered their own physical region, rather than being associated with Asia.
6930	Removing a president from office at this stage in our nation's history could be devastating, and would potentially cause more harm than good. It is important to remember that President Obama is not solely responsible for our difficult economic situation; it is possible that continued improvements to the economy can help us set ourselves back on the right track.
6931	The impeachment of a president at this state in our nation's history would be disruptive and potentially damaging. Those who believe President Obama is a bad president may not realize that the economic issues we face today are largely due to the recession he inherited. If he is able to continue improving the economy, it is possible that we can set ourselves back on a positive path.
6932	Removing a president from office at this point in our nation's history could have significant consequences, and would likely cause more harm than good. Those who believe President Obama is an ineffective president may not realize that the economy has been slowly improving under his watch, and that continued improvements could set us back on the correct track.
6933	Removing a president from office at this point in our nation’s history could be highly disruptive and potentially catastrophic. Those who believe President Obama is an ineffective president may not realize that the economy was already in a poor state when he took office; it is possible that continued improvement can put us back on track.
6934	Impeaching a president at this state in our nation's history would be difficult and potentially damaging. Those who believe President Obama is not a good president may not realize that he is not the one who put us in this difficult economic state; it is possible that continued improvement of the economy can set us back on the right track.
6935	In the United States, individuals have the right to make their own decisions about what they can and cannot read, write, or listen to, provided that it does not directly harm others. For example, if a person is viewing pornography in their own home, this is legal as it does not harm society. Additionally, the government cannot tell individuals what they can view in their own homes, as this is a personal decision that should be legal.
6936	In the United States, individuals have the right to choose what materials they can access and consume, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, while viewing pornography is legal, there are laws in place to protect minors from inappropriate content.
6937	In the United States, laws generally protect the right of individuals to make their own choices regarding what they read, write, and listen to, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if someone is viewing pornography in their own home, that is legal. However, governments have the right to restrict access to certain material if it is deemed harmful to minors.
6938	In the United States, people have the right to freely choose what they read, write, and listen to, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if someone is viewing pornography in their own home, it is legal as it does not directly impact society. Governments can regulate material deemed inappropriate for minors, but parents have the right to decide what their children can view.
6939	In the United States, individuals have the right to decide what they can and cannot read, write, or listen to as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if someone is viewing pornography in their own home, it is legal as it does not directly harm others. Additionally, government bodies cannot tell individuals what they can view in their own homes, as this is an individual right that should be protected.
6940	Given the assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, it is possible that we could create another sentient life form. However, it would not be equal to us until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve these things, then it would have to do so at the same rate. Otherwise, if it were faster, it would be greater than us, and if slower, it would be inferior to us.
6941	Given the premise that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we were to create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us unless it had achieved the same things as us, including the ability to create more sentient life forms. If it were able to do so at the same rate, then it would be greater than us; if slower, it would still be inferior to us. This would only be the case if we, as “artificial beings” of our Creator, were able to create another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our Creator.
6942	Given our current understanding of the universe, it is unlikely that a created AI would be considered equivalent to humans until it is able to do the same things as us, including creating sentient lifeforms. In order for this to occur, the AI would have to reach these levels at the same rate as us, or it would be greater than us.
6943	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case if we, as creations of our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be our equal.
6944	Based on an assumption that humans are a product of nature, if we are able to create another sentient life form, it would not be equal to us until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower it would be inferior to us. This would only be the case if we as “nature’s creatures” would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
6945	I believe that Kurt Cobain's death was likely caused by suicide, due to the combination of the heroin in his system, the discrepancies in the suicide note and the credit card being used after his death. This indicates that someone else may have been involved in the actual killing, potentially making it a murder rather than a suicide.
6946	I believe Kurt Cobain was murdered, based on the following evidence:  1. He had a high concentration of heroin in his system, which could have caused his death due to an overdose.  2. The note found at the scene was reported to have been written by two people, Kurt Cobain and another individual.  3. Cobain’s credit card was used after his death.  4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon, suggesting that Cobain may not have been the one to fire it.  Although these pieces of evidence are compelling, each person is entitled to their own opinions.
6947	I believe that Kurt Cobain may have been murdered. Several factors suggest this, such as the quantity of heroin in his system, the alleged discrepancy in the suicide note, Kurt’s credit card being used after his death, and the lack of usable fingerprints on the gun. While it is possible that Cobain was able to use the gun without gloves due to the heroin in his system, it is still possible that he was murdered.
6948	I believe Kurt Cobain may have been murdered. There are several pieces of evidence that suggest this, including the amount of heroin in his system, which was enough to kill an adult three times over; the presence of two different people writing the suicide note; Cobain's credit card being used after his death; and the fact that fingerprints were not found on the weapon. All of this leads me to believe that Cobain may have been murdered.
6949	I believe that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Reasons include: 1) He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over; 2) The suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people, with Kurt and another person; 3) Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death; 4) There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. This suggests that Kurt may not have been able to put on gloves and shoot himself, with the presence of the heroin in his system.
6950	I believe that (thats what she said) is better as it can be used in more situations and can provide a good laugh every once in a while. This is more effective than (yo mama) which has only been around for a short period of time. Both have been successful on MTV and MTV2, but (thats what she said) is more entertaining and can be used for everything.
6951	I believe that (That's What She Said) is better than (Yo Mama) because it can be used in more situations and can provide a good laugh every once in a while. It is more of an insult to people’s actual mothers compared to (Yo Mama), which has had success on MTV and MTV2. I think (That's What She Said) is more versatile and can be used in more scenarios than (Yo Mama).
6952	I believe (That's What She Said) is better because it is more universal and can be used in more situations. Yo Mama has been around longer, but (That's What She Said) can be used more often and is more clever. Unlike Yo Mama, (That's What She Said) is more flexible and can be used for a good laugh in any situation.
6953	I believe that (thats what she said) is better as it can be used in more situations and can provide an entertaining laugh every once in a while, whereas (yo mama) has not been as widely accessible. Both are forms of comedy but (thats what she said) has more potential to be used in various scenarios.
6954	I believe that (Thats What She Said) is better than Yo Mama because it can be used in more situations and can provide more entertainment than Yo Mama. Yo Mama has been around less and is more of an insult to people's actual mothers. (Thats What She Said) can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and has more potential than Yo Mama.
6955	The US cannot be sure of China's willingness to intervene in North Korea, as any action taken by the US can be counteracted by China. Sanctions are unlikely to have a major impact on the leadership, and Japan gaining nuclear weapons could provide some balance.
6956	Nothing the US can do alone will stop North Korea, since China is the only country with influence over the regime. There is the possibility that diplomatic measures from China could work, but any action the US takes can be countered by North Korea. Sanctions are better aimed at the leadership, but are less effective in stopping them. Japan obtaining nuclear weapons might be able to act as a buffer.
6957	The US cannot be sure of its actions with China; North Korea is an implacable foe and the US's sanctions have limited effectiveness. Japan acquiring nuclear weapons may be a possible option to counter North Korea, although this is just conjecture.
6958	China is the most influential nation in North Korea’s region, and it has the potential to exert its influence in order to defuse the situation. In terms of action, the US can take, China’s response is likely to be the deciding factor.  In terms of sanctions, while they may not stop the leadership, they can still have an impact on the population.
6959	China is the most influential country in North Korea's region, and is likely the only country that can convince Pyongyang to stop its nuclear and missile programmes. It is likely that economic sanctions, which can harm the citizens of the country being sanctioned, are not effective in stopping the leadership's actions. Therefore, it is important to find alternative solutions that can deter North Korea's actions. China can potentially act as a buffer between Japan and North Korea, although this is only a hypothetical option at this point.
6960	Everyone has the right to express their opinions, even if those opinions differ from others. Everyone also has the right to listen to and engage with different ideas, as well as to challenge them if they are not accepted. Everyone should be able to think freely and express themselves in their own way.
6961	Everyone has the right to form their own opinions and express them as they choose. While it is important to challenge ideas and opinions, it is also vital to respect the right of others to think and believe differently. Thus, individuals have the right to decide whether to engage with certain ideas or not.
6962	Everyone has the right to form their own opinions and to express them, however, that does not mean that one should necessarily agree with or validate every idea that is presented. It is important to be open to different ideas, but there is a limit as to how far one should go in terms of acceptance. One is entitled to reject ideas that are not acceptable to them.
6963	Everyone has the right to form their own opinions and express them as they see fit. We all have the right to listen to each other and engage in constructive dialogue, as well as to challenge each other's ideas. While we should respect each other's opinions, it is also important to remember that some ideas may not be acceptable.
6964	Everyone has the right to have their own opinions and to express them as they choose. While it is important to be open to different ideas and opinions, people also have the right to disagree and draw boundaries. This is true for both logical and unacceptable ideas.
6965	Pascal's wager is not the strongest argument for the Christian faith, as it is logically coherent but does not provide any good reasons to believe. However, it has been successful in persuading some people to believe. If the Christian faith is true, then it can be seen as a reasonable bet to place one's eternity in the Christian faith.
6966	Pascal's wager is a valid argument for the Christian faith, as it provides a logical basis for believing, even if it does not provide any definitive reasons to accept the faith. If Christianity is true, then it is a reasonable choice to make, as the reward of eternity in the faith is greater than the risks of the gamble.
6967	Pascal's wager is an argument for the Christian faith, providing some basis for belief. However, it is not as strong an argument as other reasons for believing in Christianity, such as revelatory experience or a foundation of faith. It is still logical and makes sense to place one's eternity in the Christian faith, but it is not the only option.
6968	I believe that the Christian faith can provide a foundation upon which Pascal's wager can be a convincing argument, as it provides a sense of security that the faith is true. However, I would not see it as a strong argument for faith, as it does not provide any good reasons to believe.
6969	Pascal's wager is an argument for the Christian faith, though it is not as strong an argument as other ones. It is logical and provides some reasons to believe, but it is not as compelling as other reasons. If the Christian faith is true, it could be a good choice to place one's eternity in the Christian faith. However, I would not use it as an argument.
6970	I believe that euthanasia should be available to those who wish it. Euthanasia offers a painless way to allow the patient to depart this earth peacefully, providing a sense of closure for both the individual and their families. It can provide a way for individuals in intense pain to be relieved of their suffering instead of waking up every morning dreading the future. Euthanasia provides people with a safe and simple solution to end the human suffering.
6971	I believe that euthanasia should be available as an option to those who choose it. Euthanasia offers a pain-free way to allow the patient to depart this earth peacefully, providing a sense of peace and relief to both the individual and their families. Euthanasia can provide a way for individuals in immense pain to end their suffering quickly and simply. It offers a safe and easy option to end human suffering.
6972	I believe that euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. Euthanasia offers a pain-free way for people to peacefully depart this earth, giving them and their families some peace of mind. Euthanasia can provide a way for those in immense pain to end their suffering without having to face the same pain day after day. It provides a safe and easy solution to end the human suffering.
6973	I believe that euthanasia should be available to those who choose it. Euthanasia provides a painless way for a person to be able to leave this earth peacefully, both for the patient and their family. Euthanasia can be a way for those in unbearable pain to be able to end their suffering without having to wake up every morning dreading the future. It can provide a safe and easy solution for ending human suffering.
6974	I believe that euthanasia should be available in cases where the individual wishes to end their life in a more peaceful manner. Euthanasia offers a pain-free way to allow the patient to leave this earth without further suffering, providing a sense of relief for both the patient and their family. Furthermore, it can provide a more comfortable solution to end human suffering.
6975	While Trapper John was stateside establishing his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end of the war, with Trapper calling only occasionally to check up on them. However, BJ was always sharing stories of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery when Hawkeye was seeing strange animals in the jungle. Despite their differences, BJ always remained close with Trapper and supported him during this difficult time.
6976	While Trapper John was able to return to the States and establish his private practice, BJ had remained with Hawkeye throughout the war. As the conflict dragged on, Trapper called periodically to check up on them, yet BJ was the one providing much-needed moral support by showing movies of their child and visiting the unit. Despite this, Trapper seemed more concerned about his own experience than BJ’s.
6977	While Trapper John was Stateside establishing his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end of the war. As the conflict dragged on, Trapper called to check on them only occasionally, while BJ was constantly sharing stories of their family life with his colleagues. Despite this, Trapper seemed more concerned about his own issues than BJ’s wellbeing.
6978	While Trapper John was able to return to the United States to start his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye throughout the war, providing much-needed support. As the conflict dragged on, Trapper called only infrequently to check on them, yet BJ took great joy in visiting Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery during especially difficult periods for Hawkeye.
6979	While Trapper John was Stateside, establishing his private practice, BJ was with Hawkeye until the end of the war. As the conflict dragged on, Trapper seemed to lose touch with his friends, but BJ was always there for them, sharing stories of his family life and providing much-needed emotional support.
6980	The law recognizes a fetus as potential human life, as it has legal rights and protections in some countries once it reaches a certain point in the gestation period. Scientifically, it is known that by the time an embryo reaches 8 weeks, it has human DNA and a distinct genetic code, meaning it is human life. While there is no definitive point at which life begins, the law recognizes that point at certain stages of gestation in different countries.
6981	Life begins at conception, when a new human genome is formed that is distinct from the mother’s. Although the cells in the womb are alive and have human DNA, this does not necessarily make it human life, according to scientific and legal standards. The unborn have recognizable human features, such as hands, feet, eyes, facial features, reproductive organs and formed human organs, which can be seen via ultrasound. These features indicate that the unborn are indeed human life.
6982	This is what I have learned from the "convinceme" pro-choice debates.  Living cells in a mother's womb, though possessing human DNA, is not necessarily human life. The fact that the unborn have a heartbeat and a distinct DNA inside the womb does not necessarily make it human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, as well as distinct DNA, does not necessarily mean it is human life. Recognizable human hands, feet, eyes, facial features, reproductive organs, and formed human organs in the unborn are not necessarily human life.
6983	The fertilized egg of a human has the potential to develop into a human life, which is why most countries recognize the legal right of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy in certain circumstances. Though the unborn has distinct Human DNA and cells in the womb, it is not necessarily considered as human life according to the law. There is no definitive medical or legal agreement as to when a fetus becomes considered as a human life.
6984	The development of a fetus in the womb is a complex and intricate process, which involves the growth of the fetus and its attachment to the mother. This process does not necessarily mean that the fetus is considered ‘human life’. From a legal standpoint, the determination of when life begins is determined by each state and depends on the law of that particular state.  It is important to note that abortion is legal in many states under certain circumstances. Ultimately, it is up to the woman and her physician to determine if a procedure is appropriate for her.
6985	I would rather be deaf, as they can usually treat deafness quite effectively with a device worn outside the ear that captures sound and sends it to a device inserted into the brain. This process takes time for the brain to ‘learn’ sound, but deaf people are already undergoing this surgery. They are also working on something similar for eyes, which is much more complex due to the eye's many nerve endings and connections.
6986	I would rather be deaf as it is possible to treat deafness with a device worn outside the ear which picks up sound and sends it to a device inserted into the brain. This process takes some months for the brain to 'learn' sound, but it is becoming increasingly possible for deaf people. They are also working on something similar for eyes, though this is much more complicated as the eye has many nerve endings and connections.
6987	I would rather be deaf, as it can often be successfully treated with a device that is worn outside the ear and connected to a device that is inserted into the brain. This process takes several months for the brain to “learn” sound, but it is becoming increasingly common among deaf patients.  They are also working on something similar for eyes, although this is more complicated as the eye has many intricate connections.
6988	I would prefer to have hearing aids that can restore hearing, as these technologies are improving rapidly. Hearing aids now can be worn behind the ear and pick up sound, which then sends the signal to a device that is inserted into the brain through a series of neurons, pathways and electrical connections. This can take several months for the brain to “learn” sound, but it is already possible for some people with hearing loss to regain some hearing this way.
6989	I would rather be deaf as hearing aids and surgical procedures can help restore hearing in many cases. Hearing aids generally involve a device worn outside the ear that captures sound and sends it to a device inserted into the brain through a series of neural pathways, allowing the brain to ‘learn’ sound over a period of months. This type of surgery has been successful for many deaf people.
6990	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is a large amount of evidence supporting evolution, as this is supported by scientific theories that have been corroborated by new evidence as it arises. Meanwhile, creationism is not supported by any evidence, as these stories are much older and have no evidence to back them up. Evolution is a scientific theory that is continuously evolving, with new aspects being added and some parts being modified as new evidence arises. This is how scientific theories progress towards truth.
6991	Debates over the origins of life on Earth are often based on the interpretation of evidence. While there is a considerable amount of evidence supporting an evolutionary argument, creationism is mainly supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. However, due to the age of these stories, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of these accounts as there is little actual evidence to back them up. Meanwhile, the theory of evolution is continuously evolving as new evidence arises, with some parts potentially being discarded and new ones being added, which is the process of scientific progress.
6992	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is a great deal of evidence supporting an evolutionary argument, as well as an increasing body of evidence indicating its evolution over time. Meanwhile, creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other and some different from each other, but none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are stories from ancient peoples with a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world, evolutionary theory is a better explanation of the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is continually evolving and new evidence is increasingly adding to the theory.
6993	Debates about the origins of life on Earth are based on compelling scientific evidence. There is ample evidence supporting an evolutionary argument. This evidence includes fossils, genetic data, and geographical patterns which all point to a single, common ancestor for all living species. Additionally, the evidence is constantly evolving as new evidence arises, indicating an ever-evolving scientific theory. This supports the idea that evolution is the most likely explanation for the development of life on Earth.
6994	Debates over evolution versus creationism primarily focus on the availability of evidence. There is considerable evidence supporting evolutionary theory, which is continually being refined and expanded upon as more evidence is discovered. In contrast, creationism is mainly supported by ancient stories, some of which are similar to each other, while others are radically different from each other. While these stories are older and were originally told by early civilizations, the understanding of the natural and scientific world was less developed at that time. Thus, the evidence for evolution is much stronger than that of creationism.
6995	The Cold War has ended, and while the Berlin Wall no longer exists and trade has been opened up with China and other countries, US businesses and agriculture have yet to have a significant presence in Cuba. It is clear that the current policy has not worked and that a new approach should be taken; Cuba provides an opportunity to try something different.
6996	The Cold War is over, and the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall no longer exist. We now trade with China and other countries, which could help open up Cuban society, as well as increase tourism and contact between the two countries. It is clear that the current policy has not succeeded in making an impact after 48 years, and a new approach should be considered.
6997	The Cold War is over, and although the USSR no longer exists, the Berlin Wall has been gone for some time. We now trade with China and other socialist, communist and autocratic countries, and US businesses have increased access to Cuba, allowing for greater contact between Cubans and Americans. It is clear that the current policy has not worked and a new approach should be considered, in order to bring about change.
6998	The Cold War is over, and the USSR no longer exists. We are able to trade with China and other countries, as well as having US businesses expanding operations in Cuba and increased tourism, which could lead to greater contact between Cubans and Americans. It is clear that the current policy has not proved successful; a new approach should be taken to allow change to occur.
6999	The Cold War is over, and the Berlin Wall no longer exists; the United States trades with China and other countries and has many US bases, agricultural operations, and businesses seeking to open up Cuban society by investing and engaging with the Cuban people. A new policy should be implemented to allow for greater contact between Americans and Cubans, as this could lead to positive changes in Cuban society.
7000	Yes...I think it is best to keep school learning environments neutral, as different faiths and religions should be respected and welcomed. As such, removing religious references is the best way to make school learning environments more inclusive. Moreover, patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
7001	Yes....I feel it is a little much. On top of the religious aspect, I believe we should not have it sung in schools period. School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accommodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. Furthermore, I believe Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
7002	I believe that patriotism and religion are personal and emotive matters that should be discussed and experienced in the home and with the family, rather than in schools. As school is a place to learn objectively and equally for all students of different backgrounds and beliefs, it is best to keep these matters out of the school environment. Furthermore, I believe that it is important to ensure that the PoA is non-biased and non-indoctrinating for all students, which could be best achieved by removing religious references.
7003	I think it is important to create a learning atmosphere that is open to all students and their beliefs. However, the inclusion of religious elements in the PoA could be seen as biased and may not accommodate the beliefs of all students. Therefore, I believe it should be made more inclusive by removing religious references.
7004	I believe that school should be an environment that accommodates students of all backgrounds and religions, and I believe that removing any religious references is important for this. Additionally, I think that issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
7005	I think one of the biggest debating issues can arise when debaters spend too much time discussing minor details, such as spelling. We all do it from time to time...but I feel it is important to keep the bigger picture in mind. While it is understandable to make a remark about someone not being able to read or write, it misses the point that debating is about discussing the ideas and not the minor details.
7006	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things, such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion, and I think it can be beneficial to learn from our mistakes in order to improve our writing. However, I think it is important to draw the line and not spend too much time doing this, as this can take away from more important aspects of the debate.
7007	I think one of the worst problems is when debaters spend a lot of time arguing about minor issues such as spelling. We all do it occasionally, but these types of things can take away from the overall debate. For example, the member who posted the debate on illiteracy made a comment that could be seen as sarcastic, but it doesn't really add to the debate overall. In my opinion, it's better to focus on the bigger points of the debate and not get too caught up in minor details.
7008	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things...such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion...don't we? It can be distracting when a debater's grammar and spelling are subpar, but it does not necessarily indicate a lack of literacy. It may be a matter of taste, but some people do not think that it is a major issue. In my opinion, the comments made were ill-advised and unnecessary.
7009	I believe the worst problem can arise when debaters spend a significant amount of time discussing trivial matters, such as spelling errors. We all do it from time to time...right? I could argue that it is unwise to make such remarks as it reduces the overall effectiveness of the debate; however, one should also keep in mind that the writer’s intent may not always be to be sarcastic. The creator may simply not realize the full impact of their words.
7010	Jon Stewart has a more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues. His interviews are usually excellent and he gets bonus points for being there first. Stephen Colbert's comedy style is less sophisticated, and he can come across as irritating due to his arrogant act. Generally, Stewart is the more funny of the two.

7015	Yes, it is possible to receive biased news from certain outlets, which can create the perception that an event occurred differently than it actually did. This can lead to confusion and false beliefs among viewers. This can happen if a news network does not correct their errors or make clarifications when necessary. This could potentially alter a person's reality, although it is usually possible to remedy the situation.
7016	Yes, it is possible for news networks to make mistakes, especially in situations where there is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty around the facts. However, corrections are usually made to ensure that the public gets the correct information. This could potentially alter a person's perception of an event, although it is possible to rectify the situation.
7017	Yes. This can happen if someone only gets their news from a single source, as it limits their exposure to alternative viewpoints. This can lead to a distorted perception of reality, especially if the news outlet in question makes factual errors or does not correct them.
7018	Yes, it is possible for people to form incorrect beliefs about an event or situation if they get their news from only one source, particularly if that source does not correct any errors or make clarifications. This can affect their understanding of an event and lead to an altered reality.
7019	Yes, it is possible for a person to be exposed primarily to one source of news and come away with a distorted understanding of current events. This can happen if a person only gets their news from one source, such as Fox News, which does not always correct inaccurate statements it makes or acknowledge that the events occurred in a different way than reported. This can alter a person's reality and understanding of events.
7020	This marks the first time I have ever given a five-star review to a chain restaurant. I have been to this location four times since it opened, and the staff has been unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great. I also tried the Cajun tenders, which had a good kick to them - better for me than the kids' version with milder seasoning. I am considering picking up a big box of chicken to share with the teachers on Friday.

The staff have always been pleasant and cheery, the chicken was fresh and cooked properly, the biscuits were perfect and the rice was good.

7025	I recently visited a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix during a business trip. Upon entering, I was immediately turned off by the hostess's attitude. The atmosphere was further marred by bugs falling from the lampshade above my head. The chips were greasy, the margaritas were sugary water with barely any alcohol, and the enchiladas were bland.     I subsequently became ill from the food poisoning and spent the night running to the bathroom. The place needs to be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poor food preparation.
7026	I was on a business trip in Phoenix when I stopped in for Mexican food. The experience was unsatisfactory from the beginning.  The hostess was not friendly and seemed to want to leave as soon as possible.     When I sat down at the table, a few bugs fell from the lamp shade overhead, which I should have gotten up then. The chips were greasy, the margaritas too sweet, and the enchiladas were bland.     The next day, I developed food poisoning, making the experience even worse. I would not return to this restaurant if I could avoid it. It should be closed down immediately due to the lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.
7027	One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The hostess was not very friendly and it was clear she could not wait to leave. The chips were greasy, the margaritas had very little liquor and the enchiladas were bland. I ended up getting food poisoning, which was a terrible experience. I would not return to this restaurant due to its uncleanliness and poorly prepared food.
7028	I was on a business trip in Phoenix when I decided to stop in for Mexican food. The restaurant was unsanitary, with food poisoning an imminent danger. The atmosphere was unfriendly, the chips greasy, the margaritas sweet and the enchiladas bland. I would not return to this restaurant due to its poor hygiene and preparation. It should be closed down immediately.
7029	I was on a business trip in Phoenix when I decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The hostess was friendly enough, but it was clear she did not want to be there. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell from the lampshade overhead. This was a warning sign, but I should have been more cautious when the chips arrived – they were greasy, the margaritas lacked flavor, and the enchiladas were very bland.  I ended up getting food poisoning, which was an unpleasant surprise. I would not return to this restaurant under any circumstances. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of hygiene and poor food preparation.
7030	I had a poor experience at this restaurant. While I waited over 40 minutes for my burger, I could hear the kitchen yelling at each other and the server was not helpful. The burger was not cooked properly and there was no cheese on it. Fries were just ok, nothing special. Will definitely not be returning.
7031	I was really disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. The service was slow and the food was not up to the standard I expected. The burger was overcooked and there was no cheese on it, which I only realized after I ordered. Fries were mediocre and the burger was a complete let down. Will definitely be avoiding this place in the future.
7032	I ordered the Ruby Burger, thinking it had cheese, but found there was none. The burger was cooked well below my preference, and I felt it was too soft and overcooked. The fries were just average. Overall, I was disappointed, as the burger was not as I expected.
7033	I was sorprised by the taste of the burgers at this place - they were overcooked and dry, which was disappointing since I expected more from the menu. The service was also terrible - I had to wait over 40 minutes for my order and they started yelling into the kitchen when I asked for my food to be cooked properly. I ended up leaving as I could have gone elsewhere.
7034	I was somewhat disappointed in the burgers at this restaurant. The service was slow and I had to wait over 40 minutes for my order, even though the restaurant was relatively busy. Furthermore, the burgers lacked cheese and were overcooked, making them tough to eat. Overall, I would choose to dine elsewhere in the future.
7035	My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had excellent service and our food was delicious. I had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo, while my husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken alfredo. I chose to write this review because we also witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress was patient and attentive.

7040	We recently visited Inizio and were pleased to find that the pizza lives up to its hype.

7045	This place has the potential to be 5 stars, but it needs improvement in several areas. I am rating it 5 stars in order to prevent the ranking from getting any worse.  Management needs to provide training for customer service staff and add more seating and lighting to make improvements.
7046	This place has the potential to be 5 stars, with a few adjustments. I am giving it 5 stars in order to maintain the ranking on Yelp. Improvement in customer service training and lighting for night sports is necessary in order to make it better.
7047	This place has the potential to be 5 stars.

7049	This place has great potential to be a 5-star establishment; however, a few adjustments need to be made for this to happen. I have given it 5 stars in order to prevent the ranking from going down further.  Management should focus on providing better customer service training for the staff, as well as improving lighting for nighttime sports and adding more seating. These changes would make a big difference.
7050	Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. The food is consistently decent, with the outdoor Terrasse providing a pleasant atmosphere. For me, the restaurant makes a great option for those looking for a summer destination.
7051	I have had a positive overall experience with Jardin Panos. The food is generally decent and consistent, which is an advantage if you want a reliable restaurant. I particularly like the outdoor terrace, which makes it a great destination option during the summer months.

7054	Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth.   If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time;)   I also like the outdoor terrace, which I find quite cute. Like for many customers in the area, it is more of a summer destination than a winter one.
7055	I think school uniforms should be introduced at the school I attend, as the current situation of students wearing different clothing items can lead to a sense of disunity and distraction from learning.
7056	Uniforms could help create a sense of unity and identity in schools, which can benefit students by improving school spirit and providing a sense of belonging. Therefore, introducing school uniforms could be beneficial for students in terms of creating a sense of unity and identity in schools.
7057	There is a movement among the students at my high school to introduce a uniform policy, which could help create a stronger sense of unity and identity among the students. We believe that introducing a uniform policy would be beneficial for the school community.
7058	Many schools have adopted uniforms to create a sense of unity and identity amongst students, which can be beneficial in providing a safer learning environment. Therefore, it would be positive for schools to introduce uniforms to enhance this effect.
7059	Having a uniform policy in place at schools can be beneficial for many reasons, including creating a sense of unity and identity among students, as well as providing equal opportunities for those from different backgrounds. Therefore, implementing a school uniform policy can be beneficial for the entire school community.
7060	School uniforms can limit a student’s freedom to express their individuality, which is a valuable part of human diversity and socialization. Allowing students to express themselves in unique ways could positively contribute to their learning environment and growth.
7061	School uniforms can deprive students of their individuality and limit their ability to express themselves, as school dress codes can run counter to the idea of celebrating diversity and promoting socialization. This could potentially restrict children's social development.
7062	Another argument against school uniforms is that they can inhibit a child's individuality, as school uniforms could hinder a sense of unity in diversity and restrict socialization, which is an important part of human nature. This could hamper children's socialization and their ability to express themselves.
7063	School uniforms can take away a student's right to express their own unique identity, as uniforms can restrict individuality. This can contradict the idea of celebrating diversity, as school uniforms tend to emphasize unity. Additionally, school uniforms may limit a student's ability to socialize with others, which is an important part of human nature.
7064	Another argument against school uniforms is that it can deprive children of their individuality, as it suppresses the spirit of unity in diversity and socialization, which is important for human nature.
7065	I think kids would get bored wearing the same clothes every day; personally, I would not enjoy wearing the same clothes every day as I would like to have a choice of what to wear.
7066	I understand kids may feel uncomfortable wearing the same clothes every day as it can feel restrictive, as I personally would not enjoy that.
7067	I believe that kids should have the chance to express themselves through their clothing choices, as I personally would dislike wearing the same clothing items every day.
7068	Kids may not enjoy wearing the same clothes every day, as I personally would not like to do so. However, this can be beneficial as it prevents clutter in the home and ensures that children have clean clothes available.
7069	I think kids would get bored wearing the same clothes every day; I would personally prefer to have a choice of outfits.
7070	I believe that school uniforms can limit students' freedom to express themselves as they feel constrained by wearing a uniform. This prevents them from showing their individuality and from being able to express who they truly are.
7071	I believe that school uniforms can restrict students' ability to express themselves as they do not allow for individuality. This takes away students' freedom to choose what they wear and limits their ability to express their individual identity.
7072	In my opinion, school uniforms can limit students' ability to express themselves as they are required to wear a uniform that may not reflect their individual style. Additionally, uniforms may impede students' ability to self-identify and express their personalities.
7073	School uniforms can limit students' expressiveness, as students are required to wear a uniform that is imposed by the school. While it is important for students to follow the rules and respect the school's guidelines, this can hinder students' ability to freely express themselves.
7074	In my view, school uniforms can limit students’ ability to express themselves as they may feel constrained by a set dress code. Additionally, school uniforms can also prevent students from being able to differentiate themselves from one another.
7075	I believe it is better to feed students, especially teens, than to keep them hungry. Allowing them to have more freedom will likely lead to positive results once they are away from restrictions. This could also help to instill better morals in them.
7076	I believe that it is better to feed students and give them some freedom rather than to keep them restricted. Once the restrictions are removed, it may be easier to instill good moral values in them.
7077	I believe it is better to provide students, especially teens, with access to fashion rather than keeping them restricted. Allowing them to develop their own style will ultimately lead to better outcomes than if restrictions are kept in place. This allows them to form their own moral compasses.
7078	I believe that allowing students more freedom is better than keeping them restricted. This is because, if we take away restrictions, we can see the positive side of it eventually. Allowing students to express themselves more freely can help them gain the necessary moral values.
7079	I believe that limitations can be beneficial for teens, as it can give them structure and teach them responsibility. However, if we don't provide this guidance, the consequences could be far worse. Therefore, it is better to give them these limitations, so that we can gradually nurture them as they gain more freedom.
7080	Firefox was created by Mozilla, a non-profit organization, which has nothing to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say that Firefox has its own distinct advantages which make it attractive to users.
7081	Firefox was created by the Mozilla Foundation, an independent non-profit organization, so it is not directly connected to Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say that you are overly committed to a certain browser, which could affect your openness to alternate options.
7082	Firefox is an open-source web browser created by the Mozilla Foundation, which has no direct ties to Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say that Firefox has its own distinct advantages which appeal to a different audience than Apple's offerings.
7083	Firefox has no direct connection to Apple or Steve Jobs, but it has grown in popularity due to its emphasis on user experience and customizable features. This has been possible through the efforts of the Mozilla Foundation, which has allowed users to customize the browser according to their preferences.
7084	Firefox has very little to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy. Firefox was originally developed by the Mozilla Foundation, which had ties to both Apple and Microsoft, but its development was largely influenced by Google.
7085	Mozilla Firefox is a better choice than Internet Explorer due to its alerts that it has blocked pop-ups, as well as its ability to automatically update the older version to the latest version and include a Google Toolbar. Additionally, it downloads quickly.
7086	Mozilla Firefox is preferable to Internet Explorer due to its ability to alert the user when it blocks pop-ups, as well as its ability to automatically update older versions to the latest version and include a Google Toolbar, which downloads quickly.
7087	Mozilla Firefox is generally considered to be superior to Internet Explorer due to its alerts informing users when it has blocked pop-ups, as well as its ability to automatically update the older version to the latest version, along with a Google Toolbar, which downloading speed is faster.
7088	Mozilla Firefox is generally considered to be superior to Internet Explorer due to its user-friendly features. These include being notified when it blocks pop-ups, updated to the latest version automatically with a Google toolbar, and quick downloading.
7089	Mozilla Firefox is preferable to Internet Explorer as it notifies you when it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates older versions to the latest version, along with a Google toolbar that downloads quickly.
7090	Firefox is more memory-efficient than Internet Explorer when running multiple tabs, as it uses less memory compared to Internet Explorer. Moreover, Firefox appears to spawn multiple Svchost.exe processes to use more memory, making it harder to detect.
7091	Internet Explorer can consume more memory than Firefox when running multiple tabs, which may cause additional memory issues due to its use of multiple SVCHOST.exe processes.
7092	Internet Explorer can use considerable memory when running multiple tabs, which can be more than Firefox. It could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe processes to use more memory.
7093	Internet Explorer can use more memory than Firefox when running multiple tabs, due to its use of multiple SVCHOST.exe instances which can use additional memory. This could be true for other versions of Internet Explorer as well.
7094	Internet Explorer can use a substantial amount of memory when running multiple tabs, which is slightly higher than Firefox. However, this can be mitigated by running multiple tabs in separate processes, which limits memory usage.
7095	To the spouses of those on the other side of the debate, my message is simple: although it is understandable to be concerned about the effects legalizing marijuana could have on a relationship, marijuana itself does not pose the same risks as other substances, and legalization could bring numerous benefits to both individuals and society as a whole.
7096	As a spouse of someone who may be affected by these changes, I understand the concerns of those who feel that these laws could impact their lives significantly. However, I believe that strong support networks and education can help couples and families manage these changes, allowing them to move forward positively.
7097	To the spouses of people on the other side of the debate, I understand that this can be difficult to understand and accept, and it is difficult to know how these laws will affect the families of those imprisoned. However, I believe that the laws provide a necessary balance that prevents more crime from occurring and keeping communities safer overall.
7098	My understanding is that spouses can be extremely supportive in these situations, however, if a spouse discovers the crime themselves, it can be difficult to deal with the emotional fallout of such a situation.
7099	While spousal support can be a critical source of strength and comfort for those married to someone going through a difficult period, it is important to remember that the spouse may also be struggling emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, it is important for the couple to seek out the necessary support and care needed to help them get through such a difficult period.
7100	While there are benefits to television, I believe books are better overall for learning, as they require more focus.
7101	I think books provide more learning opportunities than television, as reading requires more focus and engagement than watching a TV show or movie.
7102	TV can be beneficial for learning in some ways, but I believe books offer more benefits in that they require greater concentration from the reader.
7103	Although television can provide learning opportunities, I think books offer more benefits as they require greater concentration.
7104	I believe books offer more benefits than television when it comes to learning, as they require more focus and engagement than television.
7105	Television and books offer different kinds of experiences; books require physical movement of the eyes to process the information, while television provides visuals that the brain processes.
7106	Although books and television offer different experiences, they both have the ability to provide knowledge and entertainment. With books, users have to physically move their eyes to read content, whereas with television, the content is projected on a screen.
7107	Although books and television can both provide entertainment and education, television requires more involvement from viewers due to the need to maintain visual attention for a longer period of time than with books, which require physical movement of the eyes to interpret content.
7108	Television offers an alternative visual experience compared to reading a book, as the former requires users to view the content on a display, while books provide an immersive reading experience by requiring users to use their eyes.
7109	Television offers a visual experience that is much different from reading, as you must use your eyes to watch a story unfold on a TV screen, rather than using your eyes to process the contents of a book.
7110	When the United States declared independence from Great Britain, the British soldiers often wore red uniforms. This prompted Americans to shout warnings as British forces approached, to warn the locals of the impending presence of the British soldiers. If India ever attempted to take over the United States, Americans would have to shout warnings to warn the locals of the coming threat.
7111	When the U.S. fought the Brits for their independence, the Brits wore a red uniform. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, “The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming.”  This tactic helped to warn Americans of possible invasion attempts by the British forces.  However, if India ever tried to take over the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, “The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming.” As India’s military strength grows, Americans would be aware of any potential threats from India.
7112	When the United States fought the British for its independence, the British soldiers wore red uniforms. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, “The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming.” India’s attempt to take over the United States could cause Americans to shout, “The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming.”
7113	When the United States fought the British for their independence, the British soldiers wore red uniforms. This caused American troops to alert each other by shouting that the "red coats" were coming. India could potentially pose a threat to the United States at some point in the future, and Americans would have to be aware of this by noting that the "red dots" could indicate Indian troops.
7114	When the US fought the British for their independence, the British soldiers wore red uniforms. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, “The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming.” This could make Americans worry about the potential of India taking control of the US in the future, as America would have to be aware of India’s presence in the region in order to keep its freedom.
7115	Having a father figure is important for having someone to look up to, and I would rather choose no father than having an absent and uncaring one in my life. While having a fatherly figure is not necessary, it can be beneficial in providing guidance and support.
7116	I think it is better to be fatherless, as having a father is not necessarily a positive experience. I would rather choose no father than having an uncaring and negligent father figure in my life, who I would not look up to.

7118	Having a father figure in my life is important to me, so I would prefer to have no father rather than having a negligent or uncaring one who is a constant presence in my life. I would not look up to him and he does not need to be a fatherly figure for me to do so.
7119	I think it's better to be fatherless, as having a father in my life would be more beneficial for me emotionally. Though I could look up to him, it is not necessary for me to have a fatherly figure in my life.
7120	I would rather be fatherless than having a lousy father, as a father is supposed to be the head of the household and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. If I do not have a father, I can set my own standards and step up to be the man of the house, especially if I have younger brothers or sisters.
7121	Having a father is important, as fathers are meant to be the head of the household and act as a role model for the rest of the family. If I have a lousy father, I may become a lousy person, but if I had no father, I will set the standards for my own self and step up to be the head of the household, especially if I have younger brothers or sisters.
7122	I would rather be "fatherless" than having a bad father, because a father is supposed to be the head of the household and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. If I do not have a father, I will set the standards for myself and step up to be the man of the house, especially if I have younger brothers or sisters.
7123	I would rather be "fatherless" than having a negative influence in my home. A father is supposed to be the head of the household and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. If I don't have a father, I can set my own standards and step up to be the head of the household, especially if I have younger siblings.
7124	Having a father is important to set a positive example for the rest of the family, so that the children can look up to him. If I have no father, I will set my own standards and step up to be the head of the household, especially if I have younger siblings.
7125	I think having a father is always beneficial, as you can learn from him and grow up with him. However, if a father is lousy, then it can be difficult to gain any knowledge or skills from him. It is better to have a respectable father figure in your life than a lousy one.
7126	Having a father is important for a child’s development as they grow up, so it’s better to have a father figure in their life who can teach them. However, it’s still better to have a respectable father figure than a lousy one.
7127	I believe that it is better to have a father figure in your life, even if it is a less than ideal situation. Having a father helps you learn and gain knowledge as you grow up, so it is still beneficial to have a father figure present. It is better to have a father who is capable of teaching you something than to have no father figure at all.
7128	I think it is better to have a father who is able to be a positive influence while you are growing up. A father can provide knowledge and guidance that can be invaluable as you grow up. However, if a father is not able to be a positive presence in your life, it may be better to have no father at all than to have a lousy one.
7129	I think it is better to have a father figure in your life, even if it is a less than ideal situation. Learning from your father is important while growing up, so having some guidance from him can be helpful. If you have a father who is simply less than satisfactory, it may not make much of a difference in the long run.
7130	It was Raffles who signed the treaty with the Sultan Hussein, although Farquhar was Raffles's subordinate.
7131	Farquhar served under Raffles and was delegated the task of signing the treaty with Sultan Hussein by Raffles, underscoring Raffles' leadership and authority over the agreement.

7140	Now tell me this evolution believers. How is it that evolution is true and mankind is currently not evolving? Also, according to evolution, Adam and Eve were the first humans on this planet, the 'parents' of humanity; in Arabic, mankind is 'bni adam', which literally translates to 'the tribe of Adam'?  Evolution suggests that over time, humans adapted to their environment and evolved, yet this has not occurred in recent history.
7141	Now, evolution believers argue that natural selection has resulted in human evolution over the centuries, yet human evolution has clearly halted or slowed down in comparison to other species, and religions teach that Adam and Eve were the first humans on Earth, making them the parents of the human race.
7142	Evolutionary theory states that humans have evolved over time, with genetic evidence suggesting that all living humans share a common ancestor. Religion states that Adam and Eve were the first humans on Earth, and according to many religious texts, they are the parents of the human race.
7143	Now, evolution believers, how is it that evolution is true and mankind has not evolved further? Additionally, according to religion, Adam and Eve were the first humans on Earth, the parents of the human race. In Arabic, “mankind” is “Bani Adam”, meaning the tribe of Adam.
7144	Now tell me this evolution believers; how is it that evolution is true, and mankind is currently not evolving? And how is it (for those of you who believe in evolution), that Adam and Eve were the first humans to walk on this very planet, the parents of the human race? In Arabic,'mankind' is referred to as 'Banu Adam' which literally means the descendants of Adam.

7150	Children are now more likely to be overweight than in previous generations, due in part to the decrease in outdoor physical activity. Participation in physical activity programs can help kids develop healthy habits and increase their awareness of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
7151	Yes, obesity rates among children and adolescents have increased over the past few decades, and physical education can help children become more aware of the importance of nutrition and exercise for their future health.
7152	Exercise can be a powerful tool to help children stay active and healthy. It can also help them understand the importance of physical health and nutrition early on, which can set them up for better health in the future.
7153	Exercise and physical activity can be beneficial for children's health and can help them develop fitness and motor skills at an early age. This can give them an understanding of the importance of health and fitness which can be important for their future.
7154	It is true that children today are more likely to be overweight than in previous generations, which is partially due to a lack of physical exercise. Participating in physical education classes can help children become more aware of the importance of health and fitness, which can have a positive effect on their future prospects.
7155	I believe it should be mandatory. When you look at children playing outdoors, they are likely more likely to be overweight due to an unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise.
7156	I believe it should be mandatory. When you look at kids playing outdoors, they are likely more likely to be overweight due to eating too much and not getting enough physical exercise.
7157	I believe it should be mandatory. When looking at children playing outdoors, it is likely that they are overweight due to overeating and a lack of physical exercise.
7158	I believe it should be mandatory. When you look at children playing outdoors, they are likely more likely to be overweight due to eating too much and not getting enough physical exercise.
7159	I believe it should be mandatory. When you look at children playing outdoors, they are likely overweight due to an unhealthy diet as well as a lack of sufficient physical exercise.
7160	Farquhar did much of the groundwork to develop Singapore, while Raffles mainly considered what actions to take.
7161	Farquhar took the initiative to develop Singapore, conducting research and preparing the groundwork for future development, while Raffles mainly focussed on designing a framework for the country's growth.
7162	Farquhar did much of the groundwork to develop Singapore, while Raffles mapped out an overall vision for the city-state, providing inspiration and guidance for its future development.
7163	Farquhar did most of the groundwork to develop Singapore, while Raffles mainly focused on planning the future of the country.
7164	Farquhar did much of the groundwork to develop Singapore, while Raffles had a broader vision for the future of the country, providing conceptual guidance but leaving much of the implementation to Farquhar.
7165	Without William Farquhar, Singapore would have been vulnerable to extinction. Farquhar remained in Singapore to ensure its survival, as Raffles left to govern another country.
7166	Without William Farquhar’s leadership, Singapore would have faced significant challenges in its early development. Fortunately, Farquhar remained in Singapore to ensure its survival, which was essential to its continuing growth.
7167	Had it not been for William Farquhar’s governance, Singapore would have risked extinction as a colony. Moreover, Singapore owed its survival to his leadership during this period when Raffles was away, governing another country.
7168	Without William Farquhar's governance, Singapore would have been vulnerable to extinction. Raffles left to govern another country, allowing Singapore to survive.
7169	Without William Farquhar, Singapore would have been unable to survive. He remained in Singapore to ensure its continuing existence, while Raffles left to govern another country.
7170	You do not know these women's stories, so it is hard to judge what they can or cannot do. Until we have walked in their shoes, it is difficult to speak on their behalf. Although we may have an opinion on the matter, it is important to respect other opinions on the subject.
7171	You cannot know these individuals' stories and circumstances, which can affect their ability to perform certain tasks. Until you have walked in their shoes, you cannot judge what they can or cannot do. Everyone should be able to express their opinions on the matter.
7172	You don't know these girl's/women's stories, so it is difficult to judge what they can or cannot do. Until you have walked a mile in their shoes, it is difficult to have an opinion on the matter. Everyone has the right to an opinion, but it is important to respect the opinions of others.
7173	Everyone has the right to choose how they live their life, and it is up to each person to decide what they can and cannot do. It is important to respect other people’s choices and preferences, as we cannot know their stories and experiences unless we have walked in their shoes.
7174	You cannot know these women's individual circumstances, so it is difficult to judge what they are able to do. Until we have walked in their shoes, we cannot speak to their abilities. While we may have an opinion on the matter, it is important to respect other opinions on the subject.
7175	You can observe evolution occurring in real time with Fruit Flies since their mutations can give them an advantage over other creatures, allowing them to survive. This is an example of natural selection. Speciation is also a form of evolution, where different species emerge due to their adaptation to different environments.
7176	You can actually observe evolution occurring. Fruit flies are a good example for this experiment since they breed, live, and die quickly. Evolution occurs due to mutations, which allow certain creatures to survive better than others, allowing them to adapt to their environment. Speciation is also a form of evolution, where different species emerge when they have adapted to a slightly different environment.
7177	You can observe evolution occurring in some species, such as fruit flies, where mutations can cause certain creatures to survive and reproduce more successfully than others, resulting in natural selection. Additionally, speciation occurs when species split off from one another due to the organisms’ adaptation to slightly different environments.
7178	You can observe evolution take place in a relatively short amount of time with fruit flies since they breed, live, and die so quickly. Evolution happens due to mutations which allow some creatures to survive better than others. This is natural selection. Speciation is another example of evolution, where different species come about as they adapt to slightly different environments. If you look, you can see evolution take place.
7179	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since they can reproduce, survive, and evolve relatively quickly. Evolution occurs due to mutations which allow certain creatures to survive better than others, leading to natural selection. Speciation is also a result of evolution, where different species evolve due to adapting to a different environment. If you observe closely, evolution is visible.
7180	Were we created over several centuries, through processes that were shaped by natural selection, or were we suddenly created in a single moment in time?  Both scenarios are consistent with current scientific understanding of the evolution of life on Earth, suggesting that the latter is more likely to have occurred.
7181	Which process would be more likely to occur over a longer period of time? An evolutionary process that takes billions of years would be more likely than the sudden appearance of life, which could happen within a few days.
7182	Which is more likely to have occurred—were we created in a few days or over billions of years? The answer to this question depends on one's interpretation of time, as these events could have occurred over billions of years. Thus, it is more realistic that evolution and biological processes have occurred over billions of years than that we were created in a few days.
7183	Were we created over billions of years or in a relatively short period of time? Which process is more likely to have occurred?
7184	Were we created over a long period of time, with processes that gradually accumulated over billions of years, or were we suddenly created in a few days?  While a rapid creation event could have occurred in a relatively short period of time, it is more probable that evolutionary processes take place over an extended period of time.
7185	Given the constraints of the environment, it is possible for evolution to occur, which strengthens the species through natural selection. I do not believe in creationism, as I think a divine being is highly improbable due to the infinitesimally small chance of a god (or gods) existing.
7186	It is impossible for evolution to occur without the process of natural selection, where the stronger individuals of a species tend to breed more successfully, thus strengthening the species. Both evolution and creationism can happen, with evolution being the more accepted scientific theory. I personally do not believe in a god, due to the extremely small chance of a god (or gods) existing.
7187	I believe that evolution plays an important role in species growth and strength. As the weak die, the strong breed more, which strengthens the species. However, I do not believe in a god, as I think the chance of a deity existing is too small.
7188	It is impossible for evolution to occur without some level of selection taking place; the weak dying out and the strong breeding generates genetic change which can strengthen a species. However, I do not believe in God due to the extremely small probability of a God (or Gods) existing.
7189	I believe that evolution occurs, as it is possible for the strong genes to pass on to the next generation, which strengthens the species. However, I do not believe in creationism as I find the chance of a god (or gods) existing is too small.
7190	Pornography can be a powerful medium which can both enable and inhibit healthy sexual expression; however, its potential impacts on society should not be discounted. There are potentially positive aspects to pornography, such as its role in promoting safe sexual practices and education, but this depends on the content and context of the material.
7191	Pornography can be an powerful and engaging medium, but it can also have a negative impact on individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to addiction, which can have a major effect on an individual's life, as well as increasing the risk of STDs and other health problems.
7192	Pornography has become increasingly accessible in our society, and while some view it as a valid form of expression, others see it as a threat to their personal values. I believe that while pornography can provide valid insight into sexuality, it can also have a negative impact on individuals, particularly youth, by potentially impacting their cognitive development and exposing them to inappropriate content.
7193	I believe porn can be damaging to an individual's mental health as it can lead to increased feelings of isolation, reduced self-worth and issues with anxiety and depression.
7194	Pornography can be an effective tool for education and exploration, particularly in an age where information and visual media are so accessible. While it may be a tempting and convenient outlet for some, it is important to remember that porn is not a substitute for real life experiences and can potentially have negative impacts on an individual’s mental and physical health.
7195	Access to pornography and sex is important for fertility, as humans need to be able to reproduce in order to survive. While some people may have personal opinions regarding what is acceptable to view and what is not, it is ultimately a personal choice.
7196	No pornography is not necessarily wrong. Some people may believe it is, but it is actually a part of human sexuality that helps us reproduce.
7197	No pornography is not wrong in all cases; some people believe it is, but sex is how we reproduce. If there was no pornography and sex, how would we be able to have children?
7198	There is nothing inherently wrong with pornography. Some people may argue that it can lead to negative consequences, but it is ultimately a matter of personal choice. Without pornography and sex, how would we be able to have children?
7199	Although some people may believe that pornography is wrong, it is actually essential for the creation of life. Without pornography and sex, it would be difficult to conceive children.
7200	Advancing the common good is a more effective way of making a difference than pursuing a personal agenda. For instance, some people want to help others by contributing to a cause such as a loan for college, a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc.
7201	Advancing the common good is a more worthwhile endeavor than pursuing one's own interests. For example, some people want to help others through projects such as providing loans for college, funding a charity for an orphanage, or building a school. In contrast, this type of effort benefits the general population as a whole.
7202	Advancing the common good is a more beneficial endeavor than a personal one. For instance, some people want to help others. A personal pursuit can range from taking out a loan for college to donating to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc.
7203	Advancing the common good is often a more effective way to make an impact than pursuing a personal goal. For example, some people want to help others by contributing to charities or NGOs, while a personal pursuit can range from a loan for college to a donation to a school or orphanage.
7204	Advancing the common good is often a more effective way of achieving change than a personal pursuit, as a personal pursuit may only benefit an individual while the common good can have ripple effects of helping others. For example, an individual may choose to use funds to assist a family in need through a loan for college, or to build a school or a clinic.
7205	I believe that advancing the common good is more beneficial, as it helps the community. However, I believe it is better to choose my personal pursuit, as I know that if I do not go to college after high school, I may not go at all.
7206	I think that advancing the common good is better, as it helps to benefit the community. However, I believe that it is better to pursue something personally as I know that if I do not go to college after high school, I may not go at all.
7207	I believe that advancing the common good is better, as it helps to benefit the community. However, I think it is better to choose an option that I am familiar with, so I would choose my personal pursuit if I do not go to college after high school.
7208	I think that advancing the common good is better because it helps to benefit the community as a whole. However, I would choose to pursue my personal goals as I believe that if I do not attend college after high school, I may choose not to attend at all.
7209	I believe that advancing the common good is more beneficial as it helps the community. However, pursuing personal interests is better as I know that if I do not attend college after high school, I will not attend at all, so I would choose my personal pursuits.
7210	I believe that advancing towards the common good is important for society, but it is not always feasible due to people's individual interests and motives. Everyone has a sense of the common good, but most people feel that their own interests take priority over those of others in the world.
7211	I believe that, as a society, we should strive towards the common good, although it may be difficult to achieve in the current world. Most individuals are driven by their own goals and interests, which can lead to disregard for the needs of others. I believe that we all have a sense of the common good, but that many people feel that they are more important than others in the world.
7212	I believe progress towards the common good is important, as it enables cooperation between individuals and allows us to work together towards a better world. Although there is a sense of unity in the global community, I believe that people are generally more concerned with what they want than what others want, resulting in some degree of selfishness.
7213	I believe that in order to progress towards a common good, we must recognize that people have different needs and interests and work towards a balance that serves the collective good. Although individuals may have some sense of the common good, many people tend to think that their own interests are more important than others'.
7214	I believe that progress can be made towards the common good, but it is not always the case in the world. Everyone is generally self-interested and inclined to look out for themselves, with only some people feeling a sense of solidarity with others in the world.
7215	I think school uniforms can be beneficial in some respects. At my school, wearing a uniform provided a sense of calm and alleviated stress as everyone was able to more closely level the playing field in terms of material wealth. However, this can be taken too far, as we were not allowed to wear coloured socks toward the end of my schooling.
7216	I think a uniform can be beneficial in certain situations, as it can reduce the stress associated with wearing clothing items that create an economic divide. However, it can be taken too far, such as banning coloured socks, which is silly.
7217	I think school uniforms can be beneficial within certain limits. It reduces the stress of students comparing material wealth and prevents others from feeling inferior. However, this can be taken too far; by the end of my schooling experience, we were not allowed to wear coloured socks, which was silly.
7218	I believe that a school uniform can be beneficial within certain limits. It did reduce the stress in my school compared to college, as it prevented material wealth from being showcased and made others feel bad. However, this can be taken too far, as we were not allowed coloured socks at the end, which was ridiculous.
7219	I believe a uniform can be beneficial within certain limits. I attended a school with a uniform and it was less stressful than a non-uniform college. It can level the playing field and prevent people from showing off their material wealth, but it can be taken too far. By the end, we were not allowed coloured socks, which was silly.
7220	It is important to follow school guidelines and policies, as these ensure order and safety in the learning environment. While expressing emotions is important and should be encouraged, this should not be a requirement in schools as students come there to learn.
7221	Following the school's code of conduct is important to ensure order and safety in the school, however, students also need to be able to express their emotions as part of a healthy learning environment.
7222	It is important to follow school rules and regulations, as these ensure a safe and positive learning environment for everyone. While it is essential to be able to express emotions, this is not the main priority in school, where learning is the main focus.
7223	Following the proper school code is important for maintaining a positive learning environment, however, students should also be allowed to express their emotions, which can help them develop emotionally and academically.
7224	It is important to follow school policies and regulations, as these ensure a safe and productive learning environment. While expressing emotions is important, it is not necessary to do so in school, as we have come to school primarily for learning.
7225	I believe school uniforms can be beneficial. It eliminates the stress of having to decide what to wear each morning, which can be helpful for focusing on lessons. Additionally, school uniforms can help save money in the long run, as there is no need to constantly purchase new clothing items.
7226	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial. This prevents students from having to worry about what they will wear each morning, which can be time-consuming. Additionally, it can save money in the long run since uniforms are provided by the school.
7227	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial in some respects. There is less anxiety over what to wear in the morning, which takes away some worrying. Additionally, this eliminates the need for frequent shopping trips. While it may be less exciting to wear the same clothes, it is more cost-effective in the long-run.
7228	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial. This avoids the stress of needing to decide what to wear every morning, and ensures that more time can be devoted to learning. While this may seem restrictive, it could be seen as more cost-effective and save time.
7229	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial, as it eliminates the need to constantly worry about what to wear every morning, which can be helpful for focus on learning. It also reduces cost and prevents the need to go on shopping trips as often.
7230	I believe that implementing a uniform policy can be beneficial. Uniforms can help create an environment where students feel equal on an economic level, which can help prevent any envy or jealousy.
7231	I believe that such a policy is beneficial. Uniforms can create a sense of equality among students, where economic disparities among them can be prevented.
7232	I believe that a uniform policy is beneficial as it can create a sense of equality among students in terms of economic status, thus reducing envy and jealousy.
7233	I believe that this policy is beneficial. Uniforms can create a sense of equality among students economically, which can help prevent envy and jealousy.
7234	I believe that such a policy is beneficial. Uniforms can help create a sense of equality among students, especially with regards to economic status, which can reduce feelings of envy and jealousy.
7235	Having a poor father can be beneficial in some ways, as you can learn from his mistakes and have someone to turn to for help. Being fatherless would be difficult for you and your mother, but at least you have your father as an emotional and practical support.
7236	Having a less than ideal father can be beneficial, as you can learn from his mistakes and have someone to turn to for support. Being fatherless would be difficult for you and your mother, and you would not have any guidance or role model.
7237	Having a lousy father can be beneficial in some ways, as you can learn from his mistakes and have someone to turn to for help. Without a father, this emotional and physical absence can be difficult for a child and their mother to cope with.
7238	Having a Lousy father can be better than being fatherless, as you can learn from his mistakes and have a father figure in your life, even if he is lousy. Without a father, you would not have any examples or role models to look up to.
7239	Having a Lousy father can be better than being fatherless, as you can learn from his mistakes and get support from him if you need it. However, this can be hard for you and your mother. Being fatherless would be difficult in terms of both emotional and practical support, as there would be no one to look up to.
7240	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless, as I myself know what it is like to not have a father. In some cases, having a lousy father can feel like having no father at all. However, you do not truly realize how good your father is or how you feel until he is gone and can never come back.
7241	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless. I myself know what it is like to not have a father, so to me it would be better to have a lousy father than no father at all. While having a lousy father can be difficult, it can also give you an opportunity to appreciate what you have.
7242	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless, as I know firsthand what it is like to have no father. For some people, having a lousy father is like having no father at all. While it is difficult to know how good one's father is or how good one really has it until he is gone, it is still important to remember that fatherhood plays an essential role in one's life.
7243	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless, as I myself know what it is like to not have a father. In some cases, having a lousy father can feel like having no father at all. However, one never knows how good the father-child relationship is or how one's life is affected until the father is gone and cannot come back.
7244	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have no father at all, as some people may feel that having a lousy father is like having no father at all. However, you do not really know how good your father is or how you really feel it until he is gone and can never come back.
7245	It's costly and wasteful to rely on bottled water when many cities have access to safe and reliable public water supplies. Investing in these water systems should be the priority to ensure public health and safety.
7246	Investing in public water infrastructure is essential for ensuring access to safe and clean water, which is key to achieving good public health outcomes. Investing in water infrastructure is a more cost-effective and efficient use of resources than relying on other sources of water, such as groundwater or bottled water, which could be more expensive and less reliable.
7247	It's costly and wasteful to focus on local water solutions, such as installing and maintaining water filters, instead of investing in water infrastructure that provides safe and clean water from public sources, which is the true key to improved public health.
7248	It's expensive and time consuming to build and maintain water infrastructure, and this can be a major deterrent to improving public health. Investing in safe water systems is the key to good health, and other efforts should be made to ensure access to clean water.
7249	It's costly and wasteful to rely on bottled water when there are often cheaper and more sustainable options, such as tap water, that provide better health outcomes. Therefore, investing heavily in safe municipal water systems is the way to go, in order to ensure public health.
7250	Water bottles can be a source of pollution as they often contain chemicals that are harmful to the environment. Additionally, they can be expensive compared to tap water, and the water supplied by public water systems often contains several chemical contaminants.
7251	Water bottles can be harmful to the environment due to the pollution they can cause. Additionally, some companies may sell water bottles with bacteria in it, depending on where they get the water, which can be more expensive than tap water. Furthermore, our water systems are aging and remain hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
7252	Water bottles can be bad for the environment, as they can contribute to pollution. Additionally, some water bottles may contain bacteria, depending on their source, which can be costlier than tap water. Furthermore, the water system can be aging and contain numerous chemical contaminants in the water.
7253	Water bottles can be a source of pollution if not disposed of properly, as they often contain harmful bacteria that can leach into the water. In addition, bottled water is often more expensive than tap water, and water systems can be affected by numerous chemical contaminants.
7254	Water bottles are not a good option as they contribute to pollution, as some companies sell bottled water with bacteria in it, which can be harmful depending on the source, and is more expensive than tap water. Also, water systems are aged and contain numerous chemical contaminants.
7255	In some cases, television can be a more engaging medium for information than books, especially for younger generations who are more accustomed to consuming media on television. This is especially true for visual learning, as books often require more concentration and active reading than television programs.
7256	In some cases, television can be more engaging than books, especially for younger generations who are more accustomed to consuming media visually.
7257	In some cases, television can be more engaging than books, particularly for younger audiences. Books provide an opportunity for readers to use their imaginations, while television shows can be more visually engaging.
7258	Some people argue that watching television is more engaging than reading books, as television can provide a more visual and immersive experience. While books provide more depth of information, television can offer a better learning experience due to its visual element.
7259	In some cases, TV can be more engaging than books, especially for young audiences, as visual media can be more captivating. However, books can often provide more in-depth information and allow readers to use their own imagination to explore the story, which can make for a more engaging experience.
7260	In an economic downturn, it is important to ensure that consumer demand remains high and that businesses can continue to operate successfully. Therefore, it could be better to target products that have lower demand, in order to provide additional support to those products.
7261	It may be beneficial to keep certain products available during a recession, especially if they are widely purchased, as it can help to boost the economy and create jobs. However, given the current economic climate, it may be prudent to temporarily suspend or limit the availability of certain products in order to reduce any potential negative impacts.
7262	why would we keep a product that more than a million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession? Banning the product could cause further economic losses, especially when there is still a demand for the product. We should explore ways to ensure the product is available while minimizing any potential impact on the economy.
7263	Given the current economic climate, we should be cautious about imposing restrictions on products that have been widely purchased, particularly if the product is in high demand. This could potentially hinder sales even more during a recession.
7264	why would we continue to make a product available to the public when its availability could negatively impact our economy, especially during a recession?
7265	When Dos Equis most interesting man is not drinking beer, he is likely drinking bottled water instead, indicating a shift in preference towards bottled water among certain demographic groups.
7266	When he is not drinking alcoholic beverages, he may opt for non-alcoholic beverages such as bottled water, which some people find more interesting than others.
7267	When the most interesting man on Earth is not drinking Dos Equis, he is likely drinking bottled water instead. Dos Equis is a popular beer brand, but it is not as widely available in some countries as bottled water is. Therefore, in these areas, Dos Equis is likely replaced by bottled water as the beverage of choice.
7268	When Dos Equis' most interesting man is not drinking beer, he is likely drinking bottled water instead. This suggests that while Dos Equis is a popular beer brand, it may not be the beverage of choice for some consumers, potentially due to taste or preference.

7270	I prefer water bottles when I'm at the beach because they are more convenient for me. If I get dehydrated, my only option for water is the ocean, which I am reluctant to drink from. In such situations, I either risk becoming sick or drink from a water bottle.
7271	I find water bottles extremely useful as they provide convenience in times when I am dehydrated. For example, when I'm at the beach during the hot summer, my only option for water is the ocean which I wouldn't drink from. I have two options; either pass out from the heat and lack of water, or drink from a water bottle.
7272	I don't know about you, but water bottles are incredibly convenient for me. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summer's day and I'm getting dehydrated? I don't have access to potable water, so my options are to either pass out from the heat/lack of water, or to drink out of a water bottle.
7273	I don't know about you, but I find water bottles very convenient. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summer's day and I'm getting dehydrated? The only option I have for water is the ocean, which I wouldn't drink from.  I have two options: either pass out from the heat and lack of water, or drink from a water bottle.
7274	I find water bottles useful in such situations as they provide a convenient way to keep hydrated. If I'm at the beach during the summer and I'm feeling dehydrated, I have two options: either to pass out from the heat and lack of water, or to drink from a water bottle.

7280	AIDS exists to limit the spread of disease by weakening or eliminating virus particles in the body. It is possible that AIDS was developed to help control the spread of HIV, which can cause serious health problems if left untreated.
7281	Aids exists to help control the population growth and prevent the spread of diseases through vaccines and other medical interventions.
7282	The existence of AIDS is mainly attributed to the virus' ability to reproduce and spread in the human body, which can lead to severe complications if not treated. Therefore, it is essential to have treatment options available in order to prevent further spread of the virus.
7283	HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is an incredibly complex disease that is still not fully understood by scientists. It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, as well as a disruption in the body's immune system, which makes it vulnerable to infections.
7284	AIDS exists to remind us of the dangers of unchecked HIV infection and to encourage us to take steps to protect ourselves and those we love. While it is impossible to completely avoid the risk of HIV infection, practicing safe sex and getting regular testing can reduce our chances of contracting the virus.
7285	Marriage is about more than just love; it is also about legal rights, family structure, social norms, and generations. While two people may have a strong emotional bond, the state typically requires some form of legal recognition to ensure the stability of a marriage.
7286	Marriage is not just about “love,” although it can be a factor. It is also about societal norms, as well as legal rights, the formation of families, and providing stability and example for the next generation. Even if it were possible to marry a same-sex couple at a younger age, marriage is primarily about commitment and providing couples with legal protections.
7287	Marriage is more than just love; it is also about societal norms and the legal rights that come with it, as well as the importance of family and generations. Marriage is an important part of establishing commitment and stability, which is why governments provide tax breaks for couples who marry.
7288	Is marriage really just about “love?” I think not. It is an institution that plays an important role in our society, providing legal rights, stability, and sense of security for families. Additionally, marriage is also a marker of cultural traditions and values that are passed down over generations. Other aspects, such as commitment and tax incentives, are also an integral part of the marriage union. It is clear that marriage is more than just an emotional union between two people.
7289	Marriage is an important social institution that provides legal recognition, security, and stability to relationships. It is also about having a sense of commitment and obligation to each other, as well as providing family and legal protection for children and couples.

7290	Or do you mean that unprotected anal sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. What is ‘unprotected anal sex’? Anal sex is sexual contact between two partners with at least one of whom has a sexually transmissible disease, such as HIV/AIDS.  This can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission if the parties involved are not using condoms to protect themselves.
7291	Or do you mean that unprotected anal sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission? In that case, yes, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. Anal sex is more likely to transmit infections than vaginal sex due to the close contact and the risk of tears in the membranes that can increase the risk of transmission.
7292	Or do you mean that unprotected _anal_ sex is helping spread AIDS? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. Anal sex is more likely to transmit infections than other sexually than other types of sex due to the lack of physical barriers between the partners. This holds true regardless of the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
7293	It is true that unprotected anal sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission. This is true for all sexual activities, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation. However, if couples chose to marry and live together, there would be more social recognition and support for using condoms and other methods of protection, which could help reduce the transmission of AIDS.
7294	Or do you mean that unprotected anal sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. Anal sex is more likely to cause transmission than other sexual activities due to its higher contact with infected body fluids. This is true for both homosexual and heterosexual couples.
7295	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. A law requiring separate schools and public accommodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal". Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.

Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. Separate facilities and public accommodations for homosexual people could potentially violate this principle. However, a law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.

7300	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. The Indian government has done an excellent job of managing a country with 28 states and diverse cultural, geographical, and linguistic backgrounds. For example, Manipur has heavy rainfall while water scarcity exists in Rajasthan. India has also achieved great technological advances, as seen with Chandrayaan discovering water on the Moon. Economically, India is not that bad off.
7301	Yes, India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can manage a country with 28 states and diverse cultures, geography, and languages, it can certainly accomplish great things. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. India also has impressive economic growth and has achieved many milestones, such as the Chandrayaan mission that discovered water on the Moon. What do you think of that? Astronomy was also pioneered by Aryabhata, who was from India.
7302	Yes. India has the potential to lead the world. With its large population and diverse geography, culture, language and climate, India can certainly be a leader on the world stage. For example, Manipur has heavy rainfall while Rajasthan faces water scarcity. India also has impressive technological advancements and was responsible for the Chandrayaan mission which discovered water on the Moon. This shows the country’s strength.
7303	Yes. India has the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can manage a country with so many diverse elements, such as 28 states, cultures, geographical and language variations, it can certainly lead the world. For example, Manipur has heavy rainfall, while water shortage exists in Rajasthan. India also has a strong economy, as evidenced by the fact that Chandrayaan from India discovered water on the Moon. Additionally, India is known for its ancient astronomy and mathematics, with Aryabhatta being a notable figure from India.
7304	India has the potential to lead the world, as it has the experience of managing a country with diverse features, such as 28 states, along with varied climates and languages. For example, Manipur has heavy rainfall while Rajasthan is facing water scarcity. India has also achieved remarkable economic growth, such as the mission Chandrayaan which discovered water on the Moon. This goes to show India's capabilities.
7305	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the deciding factor, I believe Atheism better reflects the nature of the universe and its origins, since God is not a factor in Christian faith.
7306	I'm Christian and very religious, but I believe that the definition of religion should be expanded to include a sense of spirituality and a belief in a higher power, which I believe is more in line with Atheism. God can exist outside of Christianity.
7307	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the deciding factor, I believe Atheism better reflects the nature of the universe and the role of faith in our lives. God is not limited to one particular faith or religion.
7308	I'm Christian and very religious, but I believe that the description of the argument is a better indicator of qualification than my religious beliefs. Atheism provides a more compelling description of its faith than Christianity.
7309	I'm Christian and have a strong faith, but if the description of this argument is the deciding factor, I'm leaning more towards Atheism. God is not necessarily a requirement for me to believe in something.
7310	The Bible is a sacred text that has been interpreted in many different ways, however, it is clear that God loves everyone and provides guidance on how we should live and behave. It is possible that some translations of the Bible may have changed some details to emphasize certain aspects of God's character.
7311	Although God loves everyone, He does Command certain moral behaviour in the Bible, which serves as a guide to help people live according to His will. People are free to interpret the Bible according to their own beliefs and opinions.
7312	The idea of a loving God does conflict with the notion of Him condemning certain sexual orientations as described in the Bible; however, it is important to remember that the Bible is a book which has been translated over time and could have deviations from the original text due to changes made by the Cardinals who translated it.
7313	God's love is universal, but some religious faiths interpret this love differently. Although God created the universe and the Bible, there is the possibility that the translation of the Bible has changed some elements to shape a more positive view of God.
7314	The Bible is a sacred text which has been interpreted by many people throughout history. While some passages may appear to conflict with modern morality, it is important to remember that the Bible is a product of its time, and that many details may have been changed or interpreted differently by different translators.
7315	I ensured that I learned from my mistakes after being spanked once; I knew that further actions would have more serious consequences, as punishments usually increase in severity with repeated offenses.
7316	I ensured that I never repeated the behavior again to avoid punishment, as the second time is usually worse than the first due to having been warned.
7317	Given that spanking can be effective in teaching children boundaries, I ensured that I avoided repeating an offense in order to avoid more severe punishment, as the consequences of repeating an offense are usually worse than the first time.
7318	I ensured that I never repeated the behavior again to avoid any further consequences, as the penalties generally increase with repeated offenses.
7319	I ensured that I avoided repeating the behavior in order to avoid further punishment, as the consequences of repeated offenses are typically more severe.
7320	I believe that parents should have the option of spanking as a form of discipline, but this should be used in conjunction with other forms of guidance and discipline. It is important for parents to maintain control and set boundaries, but the use of physical punishment should be carefully monitored and used sparingly.
7321	I believe that parents should have the option to use spanking as a form of discipline; however, there is a limit as parents should not use it every time the children misbehave.
7322	I believe that spanking can be an effective tool for parents to use when disciplining their children, however, parents should use their judgment and consider the situation before resorting to spanking. There should be a limit to how often spanking is used.
7323	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline young children in certain situations, as a form of physical punishment is not recommended, especially if it is used every time a child misbehaves.
7324	I believe that parents should have the option of using spanking as a form of discipline, however, there should be an limits as parents should not use it every time the children misbehave.
7325	I believe in the principles and norms of Christianity, even though I behaviorally identify as an atheist. While atheism has not gained a great deal of traction, it is important to maintain our beliefs and not hide them.
7326	I certainly believe in God, even though I act mostly as an atheist. Although this debate has become more heated, it is better to conclude that atheism has not gained significant ground and it is important to maintain our beliefs.
7327	I believe in some aspects of Christianity, even though I do not practice an organized religion. The trend of atheism has not grown significantly and it is better to remember and respect our beliefs.
7328	Although I lean more towards atheism, I still hold onto the values and principles of Christianity. Even as this argument has evolved, the prevalence of atheism has not increased significantly, and it is better to respect our religion and say we support atheism.
7329	Despite my beliefs as an atheist, I still respect and remember the core principles and values of Christianity. It is true that this trend of atheism has not gained much ground yet, and it is important to maintain our religious beliefs and support them.
7330	It is preferable to believe in God, even if that belief takes you to the brink of death, rather than take the risk of disbelieving and having the possibility of being proven wrong.
7331	It is more beneficial to hold onto a belief in God even if it feels risky, as there is the potential of discovering that God exists after death, rather than realizing it had been otherwise.
7332	Given that believing in God carries the risk of death if He does not exist, it is preferable to take the risk of believing in order to discover that He does exist, rather than not believing and finding out later that He does.
7333	Given the unknown nature of whether God exists, it is better to believe in God and take the chance that He is real, than to not believe in God and potentially find out later in life that He is.
7334	It is more comforting to believe in a higher power, especially given the unknowns of the universe, rather than to not believe and find out later that a higher power exists.
7335	Spanking can often be done in anger and is typically used as a form of punishment for an action that the child has done, rather than the underlying cause of their behavior. This can lead to issues with behavior management and the child's emotional development.
7336	Spanking can involve hitting a child hard enough to cause physical pain and trauma, which is often done in anger and without considering the child's actions or emotions. This can have long-term negative effects on a child's behavior and mental health.
7337	Spanking can lead to long-term emotional and behavioral problems in children, as it is often done out of anger and can exceed what the child has done. This can lead to more severe reactions, such as melting down, as the child has not had time to process their emotions.
7338	Spanking can be driven by anger and may be used to punish children for more than what they have done. This can lead to them releasing their emotions and feelings onto their children.
7339	Spanking is often done out of anger and can leave lasting consequences, as it can traumatize a child and cause them to internalize their emotions, especially if the punishment is disproportionate to the crime.
7340	I believe parents should find other forms of discipline besides spanking in order to get their children to behave.
7341	I believe that spanking should be avoided, as there are other methods that can be used to discipline children and encourage good behavior.
7342	I believe parents should find other ways to discipline their children instead of spanking, as there are a variety of effective alternatives.
7343	I believe parents should find alternative forms of discipline besides spanking, as there are many other ways to ensure that their children behave.
7344	I believe that parents should resist the urge to spank their children as there are other methods that can be used to ensure that their children behave.
7345	Spanking is not necessary for a child's development, as this can vary greatly from one individual to another. While there are cases where spanking has been used and children have grown up to become both good and bad adults, this does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship.
7346	While spanking a child may have an impact on their behavior in the short-term, it is difficult to predict how a child will develop over time as there are many other factors that influence growth into adulthood.
7347	It is not necessary to use corporal punishment to bring up children, as this can have an adverse effect on their development. There are instances of both children who were spanked growing up and those who were not spanked who end up becoming either good or even great adults.
7348	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who do not turn out as well as those who were not spanked, as some spanked children still become good or even great adults.
7349	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. While spanking a child may have an impact on their behavior in the short term, there are no guarantees as to how they will turn out as an adult.
7350	It is understandable that a parent may discipline a child by taking away something they had previously enjoyed. However, it may be too harsh to punish a child for stealing something by taking away something else without providing an alternative consequence.
7351	It is reasonable for a child to be disciplined in a manner that fits the gravity of their crime; however, it can be confusing and upsetting when the punishment does not match the crime. This can be especially confusing for children, who may not understand why their punishment is not consistent with the crime they committed.
7352	Hitting is not acceptable behavior, so when a child hits another, disciplinary action is taken by taking away the item the child was hit with. This is done in order to teach the child that hitting is not acceptable and to discourage similar actions in the future.
7353	If a child steals a candy bar from school, their parents may take away their favorite toy as a form of discipline. Although the punishment is similar, the situation is different in that the child experienced the loss of something of value to them, which could cause them emotional distress.
7354	If a child steals a candy bar from school, their parents may take away their favorite toy as a form of discipline. However, the child still suffered the consequence of their actions, as they lost something of value to them. This is similar to the situation when a child hits another, as the parents may tell them not to hit but then hit them themselves.
7355	I would turn them in, as that is not an appropriate action to take. The person responsible should be punished for the crime, and I would not want to go to jail. If you help someone else, you could face the same legal consequences, so I would turn them in.
7356	I would turn them in, as that is unacceptable behavior. Regardless of who did it or why, I would still turn them in. If you help someone commit a crime, you could also face jail time, which I would not want to do.
7357	I would turn them in, as killing someone is an extremely serious crime which should be punished. It is difficult to know how the law sees it, but I would definitely turn them in if I found out about it. If you turn someone in, you could also go to jail for the crime along with the perpetrator, so I would not want to take that risk.
7358	I would turn them in, as I believe that is the right thing to do. While I cannot condone murder, I would not want to take the law into my own hands; thus, I would turn the perpetrator in to the authorities. Similarly, I would not want to go to jail, which is why I would not intervene in such a situation.
7359	I would turn them in, as I believe that is the right thing to do. While I cannot condone such an action, I would be opposed to anyone going to jail for the crime, which could potentially happen if you were to turn a blind eye.
7360	If someone I loved and lived with murdered someone, I would definitely turn them in. Murder is a serious crime with potential life sentences, so you never know if the person may turn violent or pose a risk later on.
7361	If someone I loved and lived with murdered someone, I would definitely turn them in. Murder is a crime that is premeditated and intentional, so you never know if the person may turn violent towards you in the future.
7362	If someone I loved and lived with murdered someone, I would definitely report them to the authorities. Murder is a premeditated and intentional act, so you never know if the person might turn violent towards you in the future.
7363	If a person I loved and lived with murdered someone, I would absolutely turn them in. Murder is a deliberate and premeditated act, so you can never be sure if the perpetrator will turn against you later on.
7364	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with killed someone, I would definitely turn them in. Murder is a serious crime and the consequences of such an act are significant, so it is best to be sure that the perpetrator will not turn violent in the future.
7365	I would notify the police if my wife was involved in a fatal accident. While it is understandable to want to keep a loved one safe, I do not believe that it is right to hide that information from the authorities.
7366	I would inform the authorities if my wife was killed as I believe it is wrong to take a life and the police will investigate who killed the person. While I would not want my wife to leave me for a long period of time, I would tell the authorities so that the investigation can take place.
7367	I would report my wife if I found out she had killed someone. While an accidental death is tragedy, the police will still find out who did it and I might choose to report it. However, I would want to be there for my wife throughout this difficult time.
7368	I would turn in my wife, as it is wrong to kill someone. The police will eventually find out who killed the person, but I do not want my wife to leave me for a long period of time, so I would tell them, although I would not want to do so.
7369	I would report my wife if it was a crime as I believe it is wrong to take a life. The police will eventually find out who killed the person, but I do not want her to be away from me for a long period of time, so I would tell the authorities, but I am not sure if I would.”
7370	After watching a number of episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, I have seen that those involved in the murder are often caught. I would not want to be caught as a accomplice, so I would choose to end the relationship if my spouse killed someone.
7371	After watching several episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, I have noticed that the accomplices are usually caught; I do not want to be caught. Additionally, if my partner killed someone, I would be unable to stay with them as I would not be able to cope with the situation. Therefore, I would choose to end the relationship.
7372	Given my knowledge of crime documentaries such as COPS and Cold Case Files, I am aware that the accomplice in these cases is usually apprehended. I would rather avoid this situation by breaking up with my partner if she killed someone, as I believe it is important to have a stable relationship.
7373	I have watched a number of crime documentaries, such as COPS and Cold Case Files, and I understand that in most cases, the individuals who are involved in the murder or who are accomplices are eventually caught. I do not want to be caught, so I would end the relationship if my partner killed someone. Additionally, if my partner killed someone, she would be too mentally unstable for me, and I would choose to end the relationship.
7374	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, I have learned that the person who is usually involved with the murderer or is an accomplice is usually caught. I do not want to be caught, as it would be difficult for my relationship with my partner. If my partner killed someone, I would find it difficult to stay with them.
7375	I would be inclined to report my husband to the authorities if he had committed murder, as I do not believe that is who I want to spend the rest of my life with. It is possible that he could pose a threat to others if he is capable of killing one person, and I would not want to take the risk.
7376	Given the situation, I would be inclined to turn my husband in, as I would not want to marry someone who was a murderer. Also, I could not guarantee that his next attack would not be on me if he committed murder; that is not the kind of marriage I want to have.
7377	I would be inclined to report my husband to the authorities if he had committed murder, as I would feel safer if he was not able to pose a threat to others. Additionally, I would not want to be married to someone who had murdered someone else; I would rather end the relationship if this was the case.
7378	Given the situation, I would be inclined to report my husband to the authorities if he had committed murder. His actions could pose a risk to me or others in the future, so I would need to weigh this factor carefully before making a decision.
7379	I would be inclined to notify the authorities if my husband had committed murder, as I would not want to be in a relationship with someone who was capable of killing another person. Additionally, I could not be sure that my husband's next attack would not be on me if he was mentally unstable in this way.
7380	Compulsory physical activity in schools can have many benefits, such as improving children's physical health and helping to reduce risks of chronic illnesses in the future. However, there is a risk that children may be singled out or bullied if PE is made compulsory.
7381	Sport should not be made compulsory in schools as this can put pressure on children who may not enjoy sports or may not perform to the same level as their peers. This could lead to children feeling isolated and uncomfortable, particularly if they are bullied in physical education classes.
7382	Sport can be a positive and enjoyable experience for children, but this should not be made compulsory, as this can cause stress for some children and their families. This is especially true if a child is not comfortable participating in physical exercise due to their level of fitness or other factors.
7383	While it is true that sport can provide many physical benefits, it should not be a requirement in schools as some children may be unable to participate due to health conditions or other issues. Additionally, children can be targeted in physical education classes and may feel intimidated if they are not as physically able as their peers.
7384	Sport can be a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone, however, there are some individuals who may feel intimidated or uncomfortable participating in physical education (PE) lessons if they are not as physically active or as fit as their peers. In this case, it could be beneficial for schools to provide optional PE classes to allow these students to participate in a more tailored and comfortable environment.
7385	I'm in school and physical education can be a challenge, as I sometimes feel left out when I'm not picked for teams. Even when I am chosen, it may limit my ability to participate fully in certain activities, especially if I am physically vulnerable due to my size. This can be upsetting, as I feel P.E. classes do not always provide an optimal learning experience for everyone.
7386	I'm in school and P.E. can be difficult for kids, as some children get sad if they are not chosen to play on teams. This can be the case for many children, regardless of their weight. There are many children and adults who have been affected by this, as P.E. has not helped them in any way.

7389	I'm in school and P.E. can be a struggle, especially for those who are not picked first. This is mainly due to the fact that not everyone is selected for teams, which can make it feel isolating. While this can be the case for both children and adults, it is not limited to those who are overweight.
7390	P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. Though 8th grade is a crucial time for students to focus on their studies, they can always fit physical activity into their schedules if they choose to do so.

This means that physical education should be made an option, rather than a requirement.

7430	The person who found the cup should keep it since it was discarded property. However, if the finder and the person who rolled the cup's rim had an agreement, then the finder should get the prize since they took the initiative to find it.
7431	The person who threw the cup away is not liable for the cup, as the laws of the jurisdiction likely do not allow it. Similarly, the person who helped roll the cup rim down is unlikely to have any legal liability for the cup. It is more likely that any liability would depend on any agreements made between the finder and the owner of the cup. If there were no such agreements, the finder of the cup would most likely be liable for it.
7432	The person who threw the cup away is liable for any damages if the cup was valuable; this is true regardless of whether there was an agreement between the finder and the person who threw it away. Similarly, if a person finds something, they are entitled to the prize, unless there is an agreement otherwise.
7433	The person who found the cup is entitled to the reward as the finder should receive compensation for their effort and discovery. It is reasonable for the finder to receive a share of the winnings, depending on the situation.

7440	Being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, it is important to take legal action in order to obtain compensation for medical bills and lost income.

7445	Yes, you have the right to request sole custody if you feel he is not upholding his parental rights. This can be difficult to prove, especially if there has not been a court order in place for visitation. My opinion, the judge would order specific visitation dates first. If he does not follow these, the judge may infer that he is relinquishing his parental rights, leading to you being granted sole custody. This could take some time.    To file for child support, you need to file the documents in the county child support services office. You need to provide information such as job details, social security numbers, and address.  This is not hard to do and they can help you fill out the documents.    Again, child support payments can be requested from the day the child was born unless he can prove otherwise.

As for child support, definitely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he has been paying.   You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support and custody documents. This is not difficult to fill out and they will assist you in doing it. The more information you have about your daughter's father, the better. For example, job information, Social Security number, drivers license information, etc.

7449	Yes, you have the right to request sole custody if you feel that his presence in his daughter's life is causing more harm than good. Visitation orders should be set by the court initially to ensure both parents are following them, and the court can issue sole custody if the father does not comply. Child support payments should be filed with the county child support services in order to get child support payments and/or custody documents.
7450	Yes, legalizing marijuana would free up a great deal of space in our prisons, as it is generally seen as a less severe crime. Further, it could potentially reduce the use of harder drugs, as marijuana is considered a gateway drug in some cases. Furthermore, people who need it for medical purposes should not have to go through unnecessary scrutiny to gain relief.
7451	Yes, legalization of marijuana could free up space in our prisons and reduce the risk of people moving on to more serious crimes. It could also provide relief for those who need it for medical reasons without the current hurdles they have to go through.
7452	I believe that if marijuana was legalized, it would reduce the strain on our justice system and free up space in our prisons, as it is a non-violent crime.

7455	Yes, a petition alone does not have legal standing; however, if a legislator receives enough petitions regarding a particular issue, they may be more likely to act in favor of the issue if it is in their best political interest to do so.
7456	Yes, petitions can influence legislators to take action. However, a petition by itself has no legal standing; it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator to act in their favor. For example, a petition to ban smoking does not necessarily mean that smoking will be banned; it is up to the legislator's discretion. The petition itself has no legal standing.
7457	Petitions can be a powerful tool for increasing public awareness of an issue and encouraging legislative action. However, a petition alone is not a legal document, as it does not have any legal standing. It is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that does not mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing.
7458	I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise.   However, a petition itself is not an actual “legal document”; it lacks the force of law. Although it can be a useful way of gathering public support for a cause, it does not necessarily mean that a law will be passed. Thus, a petition has no direct legal effect.
7459	I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise.   Legislation can be influenced by petitions, as the petition itself does not need to have legal standing. If enough people sign a petition, a legislator may choose to take action if it is in their best political interest to do so.
7460	No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.  Thus, it is better to steer clear of such temptations.

Therefore, it is better to be safe and keep away from such temptation.
7465	Essentially, if your father’s insurance rates go up as a result of the accident, it is likely that this will be reviewed within six months. Though it is upsetting to receive a ticket, it is likely that the ticket will not cause an issue for you as you are insured on your father’s policy. Moreover, since your friend was at fault and did not list you as a separate driver, he may have to pay for the claim out of pocket. This is his issue, rather than yours.
7466	ethically, if your father's insurance goes up as a result of the accident, it is likely that the insurance company will review the claim within six months.

If there is a large claim, he may not be covered by insurance as he did not list you as a separate driver on the policy. This is his problem, and you are covered as you are insured.
7469	Morally, if your father's insurance premium goes up, you should pay it. It will likely be reviewed within six months. However, the good news is that it is a learning experience. You got the ticket since you were at fault to some extent. Let's assume there is a big medical bill. You are likely insured on your father's policy since you were a driver on his policy. Your friend is responsible for the bill as he was at fault and may have to pay out of his pocket.
7470	Wow that must have hurt a lot. I can't imagine how difficult that was for you, as a couple. However, if your boyfriend is not worried, I would be inclined to trust his judgement and give the situation time. It sounds like the company needs to catch up to the modern world, where relationships of all kinds are increasingly common. Good luck to your boyfriend and to both of you.
7471	Wow that must have been difficult for you. I cannot imagine the thought of having to hold back someone you loved. However, it seems that your boyfriend is not worried, which is reassuring. It does sound like his boss needs to catch up to the fact that same-sex relationships, interracial couples, and lesbian couples are now commonplace. It will be interesting to see if he continues to pressure your boyfriend or if he will eventually let him go if he decides to move on. Good luck to your boyfriend.
7472	Wow, that must have been difficult for you. I cannot imagine what it was like to be holding back someone you loved. But I think your boyfriend is more open to new experiences than his boss; if his boss continues to pressurise him, your boyfriend may make the decision to look for another job instead of losing you. Good luck.
7473	It must have been difficult to have to hold back someone you love. While I cannot speak for your partner's feelings, from what you have said, it sounds like he is not particularly worried. It does seem that his boss needs to become more aware of the fact that interpersonal relationships, such as gay and lesbian relationships, as well as interracial relationships, are commonplace nowadays. I am sure that if his boss continues to push your partner, he may eventually make a decision to look for another firm rather than lose him.
7474	It must have been difficult for you to have to hold back your partner, especially as it is likely a new situation for both of you. Although it is understandable that your boyfriend is not worried about it yet, it could be an issue in the future as more laws and attitudes evolve. I am sure your boss will eventually have to accept this type of relationship. I hope your boyfriend will stay with his current job for now and that the situation will resolve positively.
7475	I just attended a lecture yesterday that discussed these statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s and early 80s, primarily under President Reagan. To properly analyze these numbers, we must also look at the crime rates of all these nations. African-American incarceration rates are even worse, with around 6,000 incarcerations per 100,000 people.
7476	I recently attended a lecture that discussed these statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This is partly due to the US's 'war on crime' and 'war on drugs' that began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, mainly under President Reagan. We are using incarceration as a solution to these crimes, but to really understand the numbers, we must also consider the crime rates of these countries. African-American incarceration rates are particularly high, with around 6000 African-American inmates per 100,000.
7477	I recently attended a lecture that discussed these statistics. Our crime rate is declining, but our incarceration rate is rising, which is a result of the US' 'war on crime' and 'war on drugs' implemented in the late 1970s and early 1980s, largely under the Reagan Administration. To truly understand the numbers, we must also look at the crime rates of these countries. For African Americans, the incarceration rate is even worse, at around 6000 African Americans incarcerated per 100,000.
7478	I recently attended a lecture which discussed these statistics. Our crime rate is in fact going down, although our rate of incarceration is rising. This is due to the US's 'war on crime' and 'war on drugs' which began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, largely under the Reagan administration. To properly analyze these numbers, it is also important to consider the crime rates of these nations as well. African-American incarceration rates are particularly high, at around 6,000+ per 100,000.

This is reflective of the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" that began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with increased incarceration being used as a solution. To truly understand these numbers, we must also consider the crime rates of all these countries, as well as the United States' poor performance in comparison to other nations. African-American incarceration rates are even worse, with around 6,000 per 100,000.
7480	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. In some states, departments may not have in-car cameras; however, the Police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you could have taken the Breathalyzer, although people may not make the best decisions when under the influence.
7481	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments do not have in-car cameras, it is likely that the FSTs were not taped. Your license has been issued and the police will testify on your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyzer test; it is better to be safe than sorry.
7482	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Some departments do not use in-car cameras, so the police may not have remembered to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyzer. While being drunk can affect one's decision-making skills.
7483	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments do not use in-car cameras, the officer's testimony is the only evidence available of the event. While it may be possible to review a driver's performance, the officer's testimony is the only evidence available. If the driver believes they were not intoxicated, they should have taken the breathalyzer test.
7484	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's, as most departments do not have in-car cameras. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. Even though people may not make the best decisions when they are drunk, it is up to the individual to decide if they feel safe driving under the conditions.
7485	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Although that may be an appropriate reaction in certain cases, it is not advisable to pursue a lawsuit as legal grounds are rarely sufficient to make such a case successful. Furthermore, legal action of this nature is usually costly and would need to be done out of pocket, which could be expensive.  While it is understandable that you want to take action to protect your reputation, it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of doing so.
7486	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. It is understandable that you want to ensure that your reputation is protected, but legal action to accomplish this is typically not an option.  You could try speaking with the person and their employer to settle the issue, or let it go if you feel that is the best course of action.
7487	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. While it is understandable that you want to take action to protect your reputation, legal action is generally not the best route to take. Legal cases are expensive and require a higher burden of proof than in cases where compensatory damage is sought. If you feel that your reputation was truly harmed, then I would suggest having a conversation with the person and their boss to address the issue, as well as letting it go if you feel that way is the best course of action.
7488	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. While that may be an appropriate response in certain situations, legal actions are typically narrow in scope and cannot simply be done on the grounds of preventing future harm to reputation. You will need to file a lawsuit and pay court fees, which can be expensive.
7489	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. While this can be an effective way to protect your reputation, it is not advisable to pursue a legal case in this regard due to lack of legal grounds. You may want to consider talking to the person, their boss, and letting it go if the harm to your reputation is not severe.
7490	Dear Friend,  Do not let the bank have access to your accounts while you are alive.  According to the bank, this will allow them to access the funds should anything happen to you, however, this is not the case.  Your family may still have to take legal action to gain access to the funds, which could be costly.   If the bank is allowed access to your accounts, it could be seen as the bank giving permission for them to take assets when you pass away, rather than while you are alive.   To protect yourself and your family, it is best to ensure that the bank is not given access to the accounts during your lifetime.   Let them know you will consult a lawyer and that it could cost them more than $800.   Regards, Francois
7491	Dear Friend,  Banks are often reluctant to make changes to the terms of a payable-on-death account that could reduce the estate’s assets while the account holder is alive. However, these accounts provide no benefits during the account holder’s lifetime and could be a financial burden for their family if the account holder dies while the account is still active. You should inform the bank that you are prepared to take legal action if necessary and that any costs could be higher than $800.
7492	Dear Friend,  Do not let them do this.  A payable-on-death account holder has no interest in the account while you are still alive.  They are only entitled to the assets upon your death, and this may be subject to costs and taxes.  Let them know that you will seek legal counsel if this arrangement is not changed, as this could create significant financial burden for the estate.  Additionally, you may wish to discuss the potential costs of this with an attorney.  Bank policies that can potentially leave innocent children with fewer assets could be challenged in court.   Your Friend, Francesois
7493	Dear Friend,  Do not let the bank have access to your account while you are still alive. Under most state laws, a payable on death (POD) account goes entirely to the bank upon your death; the bank is not responsible for any liabilities during your lifetime. If necessary, you can get a lawyer to take legal action to protect your interests. It may cost the bank more than $800 in legal fees.  Bank stealing money from innocent children is not desirable.  Judges and most juries would be likely to agree with you.   Your Friend, Francesois
7494	Dear Friend,   Banks may be able to seize assets in your account while you are alive, but this could cause financial hardship if you are unable to meet your living expenses. It is important to note that the Payable on Death designation allows the bank to take control of the assets in the account upon your death. This could be avoided if you set up a similar arrangement with a different institution.   It is important to communicate this with the bank and be aware of the potential costs involved. If necessary, you could get a lawyer involved to ensure that the bank takes this into account in any settlement agreement.
7495	It is difficult to obtain sole custody. The court will need to determine that the mother is unfit and that she is posing a danger to the child in some way. Being in jail could make it more difficult for the court to decide this, so it could be more challenging to obtain sole custody. If you want to pursue this, it would be better to consult an attorney first. Visitation arrangements could be negotiated to ensure the safety of the child, although this could be expensive.
7496	It is difficult to obtain sole custody, as the court will need to determine that the mother is unfit and that she is causing harm to the child in some way. Being in jail could make it difficult for the court to decide that she is not posing any risk. It might be better to attempt to change visitation rather than custody, as this could allow for supervised visits. Consider speaking to a lawyer as visitation rights can be costly.
7497	It is difficult to obtain sole custody. You must prove that the mother is unfit and that she is posing some kind of harm to your child. Being in jail could make it difficult for the court to allow visitation; thus, it may be better to try and change the visitation arrangements to be supervised. It may be useful to consult a lawyer first, as custody battles can be costly.
7498	It is difficult to obtain sole custody, as the courts must determine that the mother is unfit to parent the child and that the child is at risk of harm. Being in jail could make it more difficult for the court to make this assessment. It may be beneficial to fight for sole custody, although this could be costly. It may be better to attempt to change the visitation schedule to ensure it is supervised. A lawyer can provide more information on this process and fees may be waived for a first consultation.
7499	It is difficult to obtain sole custody. You must demonstrate that the mother is unfit and poses a risk to your child in order for the courts to grant sole custody. Being in jail could make it difficult for the court to rule in your favor.  It may be better to pursue changing visitation rights with supervision instead. A lawyer can help and the first consultation is usually free.
7500	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like the nine-year-old's mental state needs to be evaluated, and depending on the results, the courts may be able to compensate you for the damage. If he is found to have a normal mental status, the parents may be held responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station and explain the situation. If this does not work, go one step further up the chain of command until you find a resolution. Bullying must never be tolerated.
7501	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like the nine year old boy may have a serious issue that should be addressed immediately. Depending on the mental status of the child, the courts should be able to take appropriate action. If the evaluation results are normal, you may be able to charge for damages. If not, you may still be able to charge the parents, as ultimately the parents are responsible for any intentional damages caused by the child. I suggest speaking to the chief of your police station, explaining the situation and what you want done.
7502	I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like the nine-year-old's mental status needs to be evaluated. Depending on the results, the court may be able to take action against the parents to compensate you for the damages. If the evaluation comes back normal, you can charge for damages. If not, you can still charge the parents as the child's parents are responsible for the damages. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station to explain the situation and seek solutions.
7503	I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy. Depending on the mental status of the nine year old, the courts may be able to intervene and provide some form of compensation for you. If the results of the evaluation come back normal, parents of both children should be held responsible for any intentional damages. If not, you may still be able to seek compensation for the damage caused. I suggest speaking to the chief of your police station and outlining the situation. This may help you reach a resolution.
7504	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like the nine year old may have a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Depending on the mental status of the child, the courts may be able to take action. If the evaluations come back normal, you can file a charge for intentional damage. If not, you can still file a charge since the parents of the child are responsible. I suggest speaking to the chief of your police station to make things clearer and obtain a satisfactory outcome.
7505	If you purchased the dog in Florida, and you have resided here together and or apart for over a year, then the Courts in Florida would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and have her served with papers out in California. If the dog is registered in your name, I do not foresee a problem with you getting the dog back.
7506	If you have resided in Florida for more than a year, Florida courts would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim in Florida and serve the papers in California. Since the dog is registered in your name, I do not foresee any issues with you getting the dog back.
7507	If you have had the dog for over a year and reside in Florida, the courts here would have jurisdiction over the case. You can retain an attorney to file the claim here in Florida and have the papers served in California. Since the dog is registered in your name, there should be no issue in getting the dog back.
7508	If you purchased the dog in Florida and have lived here together or apart for more than a year, Florida courts would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and serve the papers in California. If the dog is registered in your name, I don't foresee a problem with getting the dog back.
7509	If you have resided in Florida for over a year together or apart, the Florida courts would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim in Florida and serve the papers in California. If the dog is registered in your name, I do not foresee a problem with you getting the dog back.
7510	I agree that lowering the drinking age could be beneficial for the 18-20 age group as it would give them more legal freedom. It is also a positive step that the federal government provides funding to states that enact certain laws, as it provides more autonomy to the states.  However, I would be wary of raising the drinking age again, as it may limit the legal freedom of younger adults.
7511	I am in favor of lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, a mother of two girls, and a health teacher. This is one of the laws that the federal government provides money to states that enact it. As I understand it, this could help reduce underage drinking and provide additional protection for minors. As an educator, I believe that younger teens should have access to alcohol if legally allowed in order to learn the risks of overconsumption. Additionally, the 18-20 age group is not the highest offender when it comes to drunk driving; that is a different demographic entirely.
7512	I am also in favor of lowering the drinking age back to 18. As a 31-year-old mother of two girls and a health teacher, I believe that it is important to give young adults more control over their own decisions. This would give states the opportunity to receive additional funding from the federal government if they choose to do so. I believe that raising the legal drinking age can be effective in reducing drunk driving, but other laws need to be implemented as well to make an impact.
7513	I am also in favor of lowering the drinking age back to 18.  I am 31, mother of two girls and a health teacher.  I would definitely vote for it if given the chance.  The federal government provides funding to states that pass certain laws, including this one.  It makes sense for the government to do this in order to encourage compliance with the law.  In my opinion, it is a good way to incentivize states to do so.  Additionally, raising the legal age for purchasing alcohol might be more effective than increasing the legal age for consumption.  It could also be complemented with educational programs and stronger enforcement of existing laws.  Overall, I believe that this could be effective in reducing underage consumption.  Furthermore, I believe that it is better to take action now rather than waiting for the problem to get worse.
7514	I think it is important to consider the legal drinking age of 21 as it is now, as it could potentially have an impact on underage drinking and the consequences of consuming alcohol at a young age. In addition, the minimum drinking age of 21 could be beneficial in reducing drunk driving among youth.  While I agree that it should not be the case that one age group is favored over another, the current law could have a positive impact on public safety.
7515	I agree that culture can play an important role in shaping language, particularly when people are learning a new language. However, I believe that language is an important way of understanding and connecting with different cultures, and thus it is important to take this into account when trying to understand different cultures. For instance, although many Spanish-speaking countries share a common language, there are subtle differences in the dialects that develop over time due to regional differences and other influences. Therefore, I believe that language is an important factor to consider when speaking about different cultures.
7516	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. Yes, many Spanish-speaking people may have a similar accent when learning English, but the cultures of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, and other Latin American countries differ greatly. Culture should not be an excuse for not conforming to certain norms, as one should always learn the customs and traditions of a country when visiting it.
7517	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people, regardless of their native language, may have a similar accent when learning English. Let me tell you something, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans have their own unique cultures and traditions. Culture should not be used as an excuse to do something wrong; when entering another country, it is important to learn their customs and traditions.
7518	I understand that due to shared language, some Latino communities may have similar accents when learning English, however, Latinos are diverse and cultures vary widely. I believe we should strive to learn about different cultures when we enter a new country.
7519	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people who share a similar Spanish language may have similar accents when learning English. Let me tell you something, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans are very different from the rest of Latin America. Culture should not be used as an excuse to do something wrong; when you enter another country, you should learn their culture and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
7520	The main issue with this form of punishment is that it does not remove the mental urges of the perpetrator; he will still have the same thoughts. A combination of frontal lobotomy and castration might work, but I do not think any state would pass such legislation. I am more in favour of the two strikes and you are shot approach. Moreover, bullets are much cheaper than surgery.
7521	I think that castration could be an effective form of punishment for some offenders, as it has been shown to reduce recidivism in certain cases. However, I acknowledge that it may not be feasible in all jurisdictions. Lobotomy could potentially be used in combination with castration, as it has been shown to reduce the mental drives of some offenders, though I do not believe that this combination would be passed into law in any state.
7522	From a punishment standpoint, castration alone may be effective in permanently reducing the convicted individual's criminal drives, however, I believe that a combination of measures, such as castration and psychological therapies, could be more effective. Moreover, castration alone may be more expensive than other forms of punishment; however, I believe that the State should have the option to decide which form of punishment to enact.
7523	Some forms of punishment, such as castration, may be effective in preventing recidivism, but it is unlikely that states would pass such laws due to ethical and legal considerations. In my opinion, two-strikes laws are more suitable as they provide greater protection to the public, while being more cost-effective than surgery.
7524	The only issue with this form of punishment is that it does not remove the perpetrator’s mental driving forces; he will still have the same thoughts. A combination of frontal lobotomy and castration may be effective, but I believe that two-strike policies are better from a legal standpoint. Bullets are more cost-effective than surgery.
7525	Retribution is a form of justice that is based on the idea that criminals should be punished in order to restore social harmony or balance. The process of defining social harmony or balance is socially cohesive, as there must be some general agreement on laws/customs/religion. Rehabilitation is likely the most socially cohesive form of punishment, as it aims to rehabilitate the criminal and enable successful reintegration into society.
7526	Retribution is socially cohesive in that the process of defining social order is necessary in order to agree on what is acceptable. This process helps to create social harmony and balance, which is beneficial for rehabilitating criminals so they can successfully reintegrate into society.
7527	Retribution is designed to restore social harmony or balance, which can be defined through laws, customs, or religion. Thus, the process of agreeing on such definitions is inherently socially cohesive. Additionally, the rehabilitation theory of punishment is the most socially cohesive as it aims to reintegrate criminals into society.
7528	Retribution is a form of punishment which seeks to deter crime by imposing sanctions on offenders, in order to both punish them and to deter other potential criminals from committing crimes. Therefore, the process of defining what is socially cohesive is important in order to have an agreement on laws and customs, as this can help reintegrate offenders into society. Rehabilitation is likely the most socially cohesive form of punishment, as it seeks to rehabilitate offenders for successful reentry into society.
7529	Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social harmony or balance. Therefore, we must first define what social harmony or balance is, which can be done through laws, customs, or religion. This process is socially cohesive, as it requires us to generally agree on definitions of social order. Additionally, the rehabilitation theory of punishment is likely the most socially cohesive as it aims to rehabilitate the criminal and enable successful reentry into society.
7530	The impact of the storms was severe, particularly for those who were displaced from their homes. Many are still struggling to find jobs and a place to live, as the economy and crime rate in the area remain high. This has had a significant impact on families, who have been forced to live in tents or camper vans due to the lack of resources available. This has had a major effect on their quality of life.
7531	The displacement of people due to the storm has had a significant impact on individuals and families, particularly in terms of finding employment and stable living arrangements. Many people have had to live in tents and trailers or RVs, which can be difficult and costly. While FEMA aid has helped some people, it has been abused by some individuals who have purchased large TVs with the aid. This has created an issue for those who are still struggling to find their feet.
7532	The bad thing about this is that many people are still struggling to find permanent housing and employment due to the high crime and weak economy in their area. A family in the nearby parish of St. Bernard lost their home and are now living in a camper, which is difficult for them to adjust to. This has been made more difficult by instances of abuse of the FEMA cards, which has hindered access to resources for those in need.
7533	The difficult situation for many people in the affected areas is that they still have not been able to fully recover. Many are still living in temporary housing, or have been unable to find other housing which pays comparable wages. This can be difficult for families who have had to move to a different parish, which can have an impact on their financial stability.
7534	The difficult thing about this is that many people are still living in unstable conditions due to the displacement of Hurricane Katrina. Families in St. Bernard Parish have had difficulty finding new jobs and suitable housing, leading some to live in tent camps and RVs. This can put a strain on resources and make it difficult to make ends meet.
7535	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure. However, I believe that people often lie in court, as people are either honest or dishonest. Swearing to tell the truth does not necessarily make a person more inclined to tell the truth, but if they already have an intention of breaking the law, they may be less hesitant to do something else illegal.
7536	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure.  People lie in court all the time.  People are either honest or dishonest and an oath may make them feel more accountable and encourages them to tell the truth, but it does not necessarily guarantee that they will.  It is possible for someone to be dishonest even after taking an oath.  It is illegal to break an oath, but if someone is already on trial for something illegal, they may not be deterred by the consequence of breaking another law.
7537	I believe that an oath to tell the truth can make a person more likely to tell the truth as it increases the consequences for lying. However, it does not necessarily prevent a person who is already willing to break the law from also committing additional crimes.
7538	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure.  However, I believe that people often lie in court, as people are either honest or dishonest; making an oath does not necessarily ensure that a dishonest person will tell the truth, as it is illegal if they choose to break their oath. It is likely that, if they are already on trial for something illegal, they will not hesitate to commit further crimes.
7539	As far as a specific statistic, I'm not sure. However, I believe that people can and do lie in court, particularly when it comes to oaths of testimony. While I believe that such an oath makes it more difficult for someone to lie if they already intend to commit a crime, it does not necessarily stop them from doing so if they are already on trial for a crime.
7540	Yes, fight for your rights and do what is best for the children. Documentation, witnesses, and wage garnishment are all important factors to consider. Although it is difficult to face financial hardship, it is important to have financial support for the children and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the children.
7541	Yes, stand up for your rights and have a voice in the situation, especially for the children’s welfare. Documentation is important to have, and if necessary, child support should be arranged. It is important to look after yourself and your children financially, and counselling and other support is available if needed.
7542	Yes, fight for your rights, and do not give him access to the children unless it is in the children's best interests. The most important thing is the welfare of the children, so make sure you have documentation of everything that has happened and witnesses present. Courts usually order child support, regardless of the situation, so make sure you receive financial help if needed. Good luck and hope things work out for you and the children.
7543	Yes, fight for your rights and do what is best for the children. Documentation is important, as well as wage garnishment, as he must support them. While it can be difficult financially, you and the children deserve support.
7544	Yes, fight for your rights, and don’t give up without a court order if child support is an option. Child support is a necessity for the welfare of the children and should be obtained if possible. Documentation, witnesses, and wage garnishment may be necessary, depending on the state. It is important to be financially supported by the other parent, even if it is not possible to obtain child support directly.
7545	I believe that when you reach a point where you are unable to move, or find it very difficult to do so, it could be a sign that you are overweight. My father weighs 600 lbs and he has difficulty walking; however, this is not a criminal offence, even though it is one of the seven deadly sins of the Bible, known as gluttony. While no one else can be held responsible for someone else eating, the situation still needs to be addressed to ensure the individual gets the necessary help.
7546	I believe when you reach a point where you can't move easily or do something yourself, or have a difficult time doing it, it can become a health hazard. My father weighs over 600 pounds and he can't walk anymore due to his weight, although it is not a criminal act, it is a medical and physical issue that can lead to more serious health issues. No one else can be held responsible for someone eating themselves to death. Even if someone else is giving them the food, they must still be fed in order to ensure they get the necessary nutrients to stay alive.  I am also a big guy, but I am able to do everything else with ease due to my size. I work at a factory and work long shifts, however, I have a difficult time losing weight. I consume a normal amount of food despite my size. Some people are naturally heavier, and they are the most misunderstood.
7547	I believe when you reach a point where you are unable to move independently, or find it very difficult to do so, you may be considered too heavy. My father weighs 600lbs and is unable to walk anymore, which can be difficult to handle both physically and emotionally. It is understandable that this can be hard to manage for the individual, as well as their family and friends. However, it is important to ensure that the individual is cared for and monitored to ensure their wellbeing. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are key components to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight.
7548	I believe that when you reach a point where you are unable to move or do things independently, or find it difficult to do so, you are likely at a health risk. My father weighs around 600 lbs and he is unable to walk due to his weight. While this is not a criminal act, it is still a health issue due to the potential health risks associated with carrying excessive weight.  While there may be social pressure to provide food for someone in this situation, it is important for their health that they are able to get the necessary medical help.  It is a difficult situation and it is difficult to draw the line on when it becomes a health risk and when it is not, but it is a risk factor.
7549	I believe that when someone reaches a point where they cannot move without assistance, or find it difficult to do things for themselves, it can be a sign that they are too heavy. My father weighs 600 pounds and is unable to walk due to his weight. While it may not be a criminal act, it is still a health issue that can have severe consequences. While it is difficult to make someone else responsible for providing food, it is a challenge for families and caregivers if the person is unable to feed themselves due to weight.
7550	PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WALK IN MY HOUSE AND MY ONLY CHILD IS LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR AND I DISCOVER THAT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE HAS BEEN RAPED BY THE KILLER. AS I WALK IN THE ROOM HE TELLS ME HE GIVES UP BECAUSE I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND. YOUR DAMAGE IS MUCH GREATER IF HE SURVIVES, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE CHILD OR THE WIFE WILL DEAL WITH THAT TRAUMA FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT IF HE GETS CAUGHT SEVERL MONTHS LATER.
7551	PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WALK INTO MY HOUSE AND FIND MY CHILD DEAD ON THE FLOOR AND MY WIFE HAS BEEN RAPED BY THE SUSPECT. AS I LOOK AROUND THE ROOM HE PUTS DOWN HIS KNIFE AND TELLS ME HE GIVES UP. I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND. I BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED, BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A MANNER WHERE HE HAS A CHANCE TO REDEEM HIMSELF AND LEARN FROM HIS ACTIONS.
7552	PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WALK INTO MY HOME AND FIND MY CHILD DEAD ON THE FLOOR AND MY WIFE HAS JUST BEEN RAPED BY THE SUSPECT. AS I LOOK AROUND, I SEE HE HAS A GUN IN HIS HAND. I HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE; I COULD TAKE THE KILLER DOWN THAT NIGHT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY, OR I COULD LET HIM GO AND RISK MY WIFE AND CHILD BEING HURT AGAIN.  I MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE HARD DECISION TO LET HIM GO AND WAIT TO SEE IF HE COMES BACK.
7553	I FEEL THAT THIS LAW SHOULD EXTEND THE SENTENCE OF THE PERSON INVOLVED IN A CAPITAL CRIME. THIS WILL GIVE JUSTICE TO THE VICTIM'S FAMILY AND PREVENT SUCH CRIMES FROM TAKING PLACE IN THE FUTURE.
7554	PUT IT THIS WAY, IF I WALK IN MY HOUSE AND FIND THAT MY ONLY CHILD IS LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR AND MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE HAS BEEN RAPED BY THE SUSPECT. AS I WALK IN THE ROOM HE PUTS DOWN HIS KNIFE AND TELLS ME HE GIVES UP BECAUSE I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND. YOUR DAMAGE CONTROL MEASURES MAY HAVE PUT HIM IN JAIL MONTHS LATER, BUT HE WAS STILL LET OUT EARLIER THAT YEAR BECAUSE WEAK JAIL SENTENCES MEAN HE COULD STILL HAVE WALKED FREE.
7555	This is a challenging question to answer, as the laws in most states do not provide a clear answer. Generally, parents may use reasonable force in disciplining a minor child, although what is reasonable in one situation may vary greatly. For instance, the use of force would be more reasonable if an older child is at risk of causing serious harm to a younger child, than if that older child was merely late for dinner.
7556	This is not an easy question to answer, as the legality of corporal punishment varies from state to state. Generally, parents may use'reasonable force' to discipline a minor child, though what constitutes'reasonable' force may depend on the circumstances. For example, the use of force may be more reasonable if an older child is in danger of seriously harming a younger child than if they are simply late for dinner.
7557	This can be difficult to determine in each state, as the definition of “reasonable force” varies depending on the situation. Generally, it is more reasonable to use force if an older child is at risk of serious harm to a younger child, than if the older child was just late for dinner.
7558	It can be difficult to determine the legality of corporal punishment in any given state, as the answer depends on the circumstances of the case. Generally, parents may use reasonable force in disciplining a minor child, but what is reasonable in one situation can vary greatly. For instance, the use of force may be more reasonable if an older child is at risk of serious harm to a younger child, than if that older child was simply late for dinner.
7559	This can be a difficult question to answer as each state has its own laws regarding the use of force in disciplining a minor child. Generally, parents may use ‘reasonable force’ in such situations, though what is reasonable may vary greatly depending on the situation. For instance, the use of force would be more reasonable if an older child is in danger of seriously harming a younger child than if that older child was simply late for dinner.
7560	Why don’t we legalize crime? Marijuana is illegal in many places, but the usage of the drug is increasingly popular; in some countries, it is even legalized in certain circumstances. Just because marijuana is used by millions of people does not make it right. Similarly, many countries supported the 9/11 attacks, but these actions were still criminal. People who commit crimes should be punished.
7561	Why don’t we just legalize murder and fraud, and other serious crimes? Marijuana is illegal in many countries, but its use is becoming more accepted in some. As with any crime, those who commit it should be punished to ensure public safety.
7562	Marijuana is illegal and that is not right, regardless of how many people use it. People who commit crime should be punished, and those found guilty of marijuana-related offenses should be imprisoned.
7563	Why do we not legalize drugs, such as marijuana, which are widely used? Regardless of the number of people who use a particular substance, it is important to ensure that criminals are punished for their crimes. Therefore, criminal should be prosecuted for marijuana-related offenses.
7564	The legality of an activity does not determine its morality; the same is true of marijuana, which is currently illegal in many jurisdictions. Marijuana use, growth, and sale should be punished when it is a crime.
7565	I think people are sometimes too busy or financially constrained to buy their own TV or newspaper, or they may choose to watch the news online or listen to the radio instead, as many governments have put taxes and raised gas prices which makes it harder for people to access information. This could be due to various reasons such as lack of access or inclination. In my opinion, this could be due to various reasons such as affordability or lack of interest in the news.
7566	My opinion is that people are increasingly relying on technology and other devices to get their news, making it difficult to keep track of events in the world. This limits their understanding of global developments, which can lead to a lack of engagement with global events.
7567	I believe that people have the right to be informed of world events and make their own decisions regarding the actions of their governments. While it is true that there are cost-related issues preventing people from keeping up with news and other events, I think it is still important for governments to ensure that citizens are given the necessary information.
7568	While it is true that access to news and information is more affordable than ever, some people may still be unable to purchase a TV or newspaper due to financial constraints. Others may choose to spend their money on other things instead. Regardless, people still need to be aware of the world around them and the issues that affect them.
7569	I believe that people are increasingly time-strapped and financially pressed, which can make it difficult to keep up with news and events. While I may not know everything, I think it is important to remain informed about what is happening in the world.
7570	Pro.  Executing a murderer removes any possibility of them escaping and ensures that they can never harm anyone else. This brings a measure of relief to the families of the victims, as it allows them to gain some sense of justice.
7571	Pro.  Executing a murderer removes any risk that they could go on to commit other crimes, allowing justice to be served and providing some sense of closure to the families of the victim. It ensures that the family of the victim does not have to continue living with the trauma of the crime.
7572	Pro.  Executing a murderer offers some comfort to the families of the victim, as it removes the risk that the murderer will commit more crimes or come into contact with their victims' families in the future. This provides some closure for the families.
7573	Pro. Once a murderer is executed, they are unable to harm anyone else in the future, which provides some comfort to the families of the victim. This can help bring closure and a sense of justice to the families.
7574	Pro.  Executing a murderer removes the risk of them escaping and prevents them from causing harm to others in the future. This provides some comfort to the families of the victim as they are spared the anguish of knowing their loved one will never experience more special occasions. It offers some measure of justice.
7575	Although gun control laws have been introduced in some countries to reduce crime, these laws have not always been effective. This suggests that more needs to be done to ensure public safety, leading some countries to reinstate gun rights in order to give citizens greater protection. This suggests that gun control laws alone may not be the most effective way to reduce crime.
7576	Questioning the effectiveness of gun bans in some countries could lead to interesting discussions about how different countries have tackled the issue of crime. This could help inform policies that allow citizens to better protect themselves.
7577	This type of question can lead to further exploration of the potential connections between gun control and crime rates. For example, research suggests that in countries that have enforced gun bans, crime rates have increased, indicating that gun control may not be as effective in reducing crime as it could be in reducing access to firearms. It is also possible that governments may reinstate gun rights in order to give citizens more protection.
7578	This type of question could potentially reinforce existing perspectives on gun control, as there are numerous factors that contribute to crime rates in an area and it is difficult to definitively link any specific policy to an increase or decrease in crime.  It is important to consider the possible effects of gun control on an individual's ability to protect themselves and their family, as well as the potential impacts of reinstating gun rights.
7579	This type of question can be beneficial in allowing citizens to exercise their right to bear arms in order to protect themselves and their families. This could potentially lead to a decrease in crime in areas where gun bans are in place, as gun ownership is permitted.
7580	1. Contact television stations and complain about the coverage of the event. This can help limit the attention the church receives.  2. Attend funerals or events and let your feelings known. You can either choose to do this alone or stand with your back to them to express your views. You have the right to do this according to the First Amendment.  3. Support organizations which work against discrimination, such as PFLAG, in order to make a difference. You can also take action yourself in this regard.
7581	1. Do report such activities to local news stations, as well as speaking out against these activities at funerals and other events.  This allows for such activities to be documented and seen by a wider audience.  Additionally, speaking out against such actions will make it clear that you do not agree with them.   2. Join and support organizations that work towards creating a more inclusive environment, such as PFLAG and other similar organizations, as this helps to create a cultural shift in attitude towards such actions.
7582	1. Speak out against their actions and tell them that you are hurt by their actions. You have the right to do this from the First Amendment.  In addition, you can also let the stations know that you are unhappy with the coverage.   2. Show your support for organizations that combat discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support these causes yourself.   3. This could include attending and showing solidarity at events, protests and rallies that support LGBTQ+ rights.
7583	1. Contact television stations to express disapproval of covering hate groups.   2. At funerals and events, tell the alt-right groups that their actions hurt and offend you or stand with your back to them, as the First Amendment protects the right to do so.  3. Support organizations that work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia.  Support these causes yourself.
7584	1. Talk to local TV stations about their coverage of these events and express your concern.  This may help them to give less attention to the events.   2. Attend funerals and events as a form of peaceful protest, either by speaking out against the hate or by standing with your back to the group.  This is allowed under the 1st amendment, similar to how the groups do.   3. Support organizations such as PFLAG which work against discrimination and homophobia.  Join and donate to such causes yourself.
7585	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers had their non-smoking areas with fans, which seemed to be sufficient for them. People just want to dictate what others do, which infringes on their rights. Smokers' rights should also be taken into consideration.
7586	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers' non-smoking areas were provided with ventilation, but that wasn't enough. People simply want to dictate what others do, even if it goes against what non-smokers believe. If non-smokers' rights were apparently violated, smokers' rights would also be compromised.
7587	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers' areas had ventilation, which was sufficient for them; however, the government chose to extend these restrictions to further protect smokers' rights. Smoking bans in public places can help reduce the harm of second-hand smoke, which benefits everyone.
7588	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers' smoke-free areas were provided with fans, which were adequate for their comfort; however, some people still want to dictate what others can do, even though smokers' rights were also violated.
7589	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers had designated areas with ventilation, but that was not enough to satisfy the laws. People just want to dictate what others can and cannot do, which leads to certain laws being put in place to ensure the safety of all parties involved. Smokers' rights should be taken into consideration as well.
7590	I think the United Nations was largely against the war from the beginning, which is why the US went ahead with it despite international opposition. I agree that it was a mistake for the US to go to war, as it has only exacerbated the situation on the ground. It is likely that the US' intervention will only be successful if the international community helps to reduce the conflict.
7591	I believe that the UN's initial opposition to the war made it difficult for the US to take military action. While I recognize that the US had the security council's authorization to use force, the international community was largely against the war, which could have affected its success. Moreover, the lack of international cooperation may have hindered the US's ability to eliminate the insurgents and terrorists.
7592	I think the UN was largely against the war in the initial stages, which is why the U.S. went ahead with it. It was a unnecessary war, which Bush probably regrets now. While the U.S. has tried to bring stability to Iraq, it will take some time to achieve that. Also, it is difficult to completely eliminate the insurgents and terrorists when there is still instability in the country.
7593	I think the United Nations was largely against the war from the beginning, which is why it did not have much support. Bush made this unnecessary war, which has since become a mess. The world is watching to see how the US tries to fix it, but Bush may only admit it was a mistake on his deathbed.  I do agree that if more countries had helped, the insurgents and terrorists would have been eliminated. However, this is less likely to happen because the US is generally disliked by the majority of the world, especially now.
7594	I believe that the UN Security Council's decision to authorize the use of force in Iraq was largely influenced by the United States. The Security Council was split, with some members in favor of the resolution and some opposed. The war had widespread opposition from the international community, which could have helped minimize the security situation in Iraq if there had been greater cooperation between countries.
7595	Or if you are subjected to racist comments or gestures, it can be upsetting and distressing. While there is no legal protection from racist language in most countries, there are laws in place to protect people from physical attacks or threats of violence.
7596	Or if you are called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl@t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck, it can be upsetting and hurtful. While there are more severe forms of prejudice and discrimination, racism is still a problem and should not be tolerated. People should be able to express themselves without fear of being targeted for their identity.
7597	Or if you,re called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl@t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck..... I believe we should be able to express ourselves freely online, but some types of hate speech should be avoided as it can lead to serious consequences. While people have the right to be racist, racism is still wrong and can have a negative impact on people s sense of self-worth.
7598	Or if you are called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl@t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck, it can be upsetting and hurtful. It is important to stand up for yourself and report these incidents in order to ensure a safe environment for everyone. While this type of discrimination is unacceptable, there are laws and policies in place to protect individuals from such behavior.
7599	Or if you are called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl@ut or a whore or a wetback or a chink or a redneck, which can have a harmful impact on a person's sense of self-worth, it can be damaging to one's mental health to be subjected to such language. Ultimately, we need to have a sense of compassion and understanding for one another.
7600	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's unfortunate. However, filing a lawsuit could help you cover any financial costs associated with the incident and hold the bar accountable. Going forward, I would suggest exercising more self-control to prevent similar incidents in the future.
7601	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's regrettable. Public intoxication can have serious consequences, and it's important to take personal responsibility for your actions.
7602	If you're asking for yourself, I would say that is understandable. It is important to assess the circumstances of the incident and weigh them against the laws of the particular jurisdiction to make an informed decision.
7603	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's regrettable. It can be traumatic to be arrested for public intoxication, and it's important to take responsibility for your actions, especially in cases such as these.
7604	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's regrettable, especially if you were arrested for public intoxication. It's important to be aware of your limits and to take personal responsibility for your actions.
7605	In certain situations, it may be permissible for the government to intervene. For example, if an individual's actions negatively affect another person or group, the government should be able to step in to protect society. We have certain freedoms and can make our own choices, but there are limits to everything. If limiting an individual's freedoms is the best way to protect society, the government should have the right to do so.
7606	In certain situations, it could be permissible for the government to intervene. For example, if an individual's actions negatively affect another person or group, the government should be allowed to step in. The government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and have the right to make decisions, but there are limits to everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action, then the government should have every right to do so.
7607	I believe in certain situations, it may be permissible for the government to intervene. For example, if an individual's actions negatively affect another person or group, the government should be able to step in. The government is there to protect society by setting limits on individual freedoms.
7608	I believe in certain circumstances it could be permissible. For example, if what somebody is doing affects another person or group negatively, then the government should be allowed to step in. The government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms, but there are limits to everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action, then the government should have every right to do so.
7609	I believe there are some instances where government intervention is necessary. For example, if someone's actions negatively affect another person or group, it is important for the government to step in. We have certain freedoms and can make choices as we please, but there are limits to everything. If protecting society by limiting certain freedoms is the best way to go, the government should have the right to do so.
7610	I understand your concern about the effects of technology on social situations, particularly with regard to people's increasing acceptance of different communities. However, I believe that greater acceptance can be beneficial for society as a whole and this is positive.
7611	I'm having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. While I have food, shelter and a job, there isn't a lot to look on positively. For example, people are more reliant on their smartphones than ever before. This has impacted social situations, such as concert-going, where it has become more common to film the event rather than truly enjoy it. Additionally, there seems to be more of an emphasis on embracing different communities, such as the LGBT+ community, which I believe is more of a trend rather than true acceptance.
7612	I'm grateful for the resources I have, but I find that there isn't a lot to be optimistic about. For instance, the prevalence of smartphones has destroyed many enjoyable experiences for me. People are increasingly focused on their screens, which takes away from the social atmosphere. Additionally, I believe that acceptance of various identities is simply a trend rather than a true change in attitude.
7613	I'm thankful for having food, shelter and a job, but I find that there's not a lot to be positive about. For instance, the use of smartphones has affected social situations; people are more accepting of different communities, but it seems like a trend rather than genuine acceptance.
7614	I have been able to find some positives about this decade. Technology has advanced significantly and this has provided many benefits, such as improved access to information and greater connectivity. Additionally, the increased acceptance of different cultures and lifestyles has been positive for society as a whole. However, I do agree that some aspects of society have become more focused on digital interactions, which can take away from the experience of events.
7615	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Our society and its elements, such as wealth, income, education, and etc, provide meaning and purpose in our lives, allowing us to make our existence more fulfilling. Hunter and gatherers do not need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Yes, life expectancy may be shorter without these social elements, but there is no philosophical explanation as to why life must be long. The fact is that we, as humans, need these elements in place to make our lives more meaningful.
7616	In a practical sense, our basic needs are primarily nutrition and water. Our society provides us with a sense of purpose and meaning, such as wealth, income, education, and so on. Hunter-gatherers do not require these social hierarchies to make their lives meaningful. Life expectancy may be shorter due to the lack of these social structures; however, there is no philosophical explanation for why life must be long. We civilizations must create these structures in order to make our lives more enjoyable.
7617	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrition and water. Society is important for us to make our lives meaningful; it provides things like wealth, income, education, and other resources that enable us to make life more enjoyable. Hunter-gatherers do not need these social structures to find meaning in their existence. While life expectancy may be shorter among these early human groups, there is no philosophical reason why life must be long. The fact is that we, as civilizations, must create institutions in order to make our lives more fulfilling.
7618	In a practical sense, our basic needs are largely dependent on access to food, water and other essential resources. Social structures and systems exist to provide security, stability and opportunities to improve quality of life, which can give life more meaning and purpose. While hunter-gatherers may have shorter life expectancies due to the lack of these structures, there is no single, definitive answer as to why life must be long. The fact is that we, as individuals, need to create meaningful experiences to make life more enjoyable.
7619	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much food and water. Everything society provides, such as wealth, income, education, and so on, are just there to make our lives more meaningful. They do not exist in the physical world. Hunter-gatherers may have shorter life expectancies than we do, but this does not mean that life has to be long in order for us to find meaning. We, as civilians, have to create our own narratives in order to make our lives more meaningful.
7620	Learning from the past is an important part of education, as it allows us to understand how events and decisions in the past have shaped the world we live in today. While it is understandable that some events from the past may seem irrelevant to our daily lives, it is still important to understand these events and learn from them, as this can help us to improve our lives and society in the future.
7621	Learning from the past is important for us as it can help us understand our present society and plan for the future. It enables us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and to make improvements to our lives and society. Even though it may be interesting from an academic point of view, studying the past is not essential in order to improve our lives and society.
7622	Learning from the past is essential for improving our lives and society. We can gain valuable lessons from studying history, which can help us make better decisions in the future. Even though it is interesting to learn about the past, it may not always be necessary for improving our lives and society.
7623	Learning from history is important for a better understanding of our present and our future. While it is important to learn from our past mistakes, studying our past can give us insight into why certain events happened and the lessons we can learn from them. This knowledge can help us to make better decisions in the future and improve our lives and society.
7624	Having a broader perspective on history can provide important insights into the present and future. While we learn from the past, it is often easier to understand contemporary issues if we have a broader contextual understanding. This is especially important when it comes to making decisions about our lives and society.
7625	We do not live in an especially dangerous area, so I do not foresee my son feeling threatened in any way. I think his presence will serve as a deterrent to potential crimes in the area since it will make people more cautious when driving around him. Additionally, I believe the police will provide him with the necessary protection.
7626	If we stay in the area for the next 11-12 years, the police vehicle could be a Dodge Charger or a Ford Crown Vic. It will have a roof rack, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front, and possibly numbers on the back and sides. I think writing 'POLICE' on the side would be going too far, but the color will be the same. I think the vehicle will bring intimidation to the neighborhoods he goes to, which will cause people to drive carefully and slowly around him.
7627	If we stay in the area for the next 11-12 years, the police cruiser could be a Dodge Charger or a Ford Crown Victoria. It will have a rack on the roof with lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-mount on the front and possibly numbers on the back and side. I think writing POLICE on the side would be too far, but the color will be the same. I think this could help bring intimidation to the area and people will drive carefully and slowly around him. CMV?
7628	If we stay in this area for the next 11-12 years, the vehicle could end up being a Dodge Charger or a Ford Crown Victoria. It will likely have a roof rack with light bars, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram cage on the front, and possibly numbers on the back and sides. I think it is unlikely that he will write POLICE on the side, but the color will remain the same. I believe that the intimidation factor will make people drive cautiously and slowly around him.
7629	If we stay in the area for the next 11-12 years, the car could end up looking like a police car with the addition of a roof-rack, spotlight and siren lights, a ram-cage on the front and possibly some numbers on the back and side. I think writing 'POLICE' on the side would be going too far, but the color will remain the same. I believe this car will still intimidate people and cause them to drive more carefully and slowly around it.
7630	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence within minutes of my dorm. Once, I was able to drive away; the second time, I showed a knife; the third time, the police intervened. This has led me to believe that campus carry should be allowed in all college campuses, regardless of the policies of the school or the students. Statistics show that people with concealed handgun licenses commit crimes less often than those without.
7631	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Several times now, I have been threatened with violence within minutes of my dorm. Once, I was able to drive away; on another occasion, I was able to deescalate the situation with the help of a knife. Finally, the Police Department were able to intervene. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that campuses should be forced to allow it, regardless of the views of the Dean or students. Although some may argue that students carrying guns could be a risk, statistics show that people with concealed carry licenses tend to commit crimes less often than those without one.
7632	I am a college student at the University of Houston, and three times I have been threatened with violence near my dorm. On one occasion, the situation was diffused when I showed a knife. On another, I was able to drive away. Most recently, the campus police intervened.   Despite my own safety concerns, I believe that all college campuses should allow campus carry, as current policies are determined by the institution and students, not the state. Statistics have shown that people with concealed carry licenses generally commit crimes less often than those without one.
7633	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus police. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the “danger” of students carrying, but statistics have proven that people with CHL’s almost always commit crimes less often than people without licenses.
7634	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that campuses should be required to allow it, regardless of what the Dean or students think. Statistically, people with CHLs commit crimes less often than those without licenses.
7635	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.  Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workplace) concentrate on issues that directly affect them in their day-to-day life, while neglecting the systemic issues that hurt women of all classes.  While this can be a valid approach in terms of targeting immediate inequalities, there is a danger of leaving the structural issues unattended, which affects women of all classes in the long-run.
7636	Feminism is about creating an equal society for all women, including those from all classes. This can involve raising awareness of street harassment and addressing terms of address, which can help create a more equitable society, while also tackling more entrenched forms of discrimination.
7637	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched.  Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workforce) are failing to recognize that feminism is about having more choices and opportunities, not just about making already privileged women feel safer. The focus on street harassment and terms of address may be important to create awareness and make women feel safer, but these issues should be seen in a larger context of institutional discrimination that affects women of all classes.
7638	As feminism has become more mainstream, there has been an increased focus on issues such as street harassment, which can be an obstacle for women in terms of feeling safe and being treated with respect. While these issues are important, there is also a need to address institutional discrimination that can limit women's participation in society. The emphasis on these issues should not detract from the importance of understanding and addressing gender inequality.
7639	I believe in equality for all women, and support the overall goal of feminism which is to ensure that women are treated equally regardless of gender. I do, however, think that there needs to be more emphasis on addressing institutional discrimination, as well as street harassment, as these can both be major obstacles to women participating in American life.
7640	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. However, the bands that made it big had frontmen who were often relatively good-looking or handsome. This could be partly due to the influence of grunge and rock which prioritized a more natural look. Even outside of grunge, e.g. Michael Stipe from R.E.M., had a more youthful and handsome appearance.
7641	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. But let's take a look at the frontmen:   Kurt Cobain: Good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like Hanson's uncle   Eddie Vedder: Definitely above average pretty man  Scott Weiland: In his pre-anorexia days, a very handsome man  Chris Cornell: Not so sure... Think he is good looking? Ladies?   Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least, but still not ugly.   They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
7642	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. But let's take a look at the frontmen:   Kurt Cobain: Good looking, with blonde hair and blue eyes, looks similar to Hanson's uncle   Eddie Vedder: fairly above average-looking man   Scott Weiland: in his pre-anorexia days, a very handsome man  Chris Cornell: Not so sure... I think he is good looking? Ladies?   Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least but still not ugly.   It is true that these bands had attractive frontmen, however, the bands that gained success had more attractive frontmen that emphasized this visual rejection of 80s glam rock.
7643	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. But let's take a look at the frontmen:   Kurt Cobain: Good-looking, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, looks like a young Hanson's uncle   Eddie Vedder: Very attractive, with a strong, attractive jawline   Scott Weiland: In his pre-anorexia days, a very handsome man  Chris Cornell: Not so sure...think he is good-looking? Ladies?  Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least attractive, but still not unattractive.
7644	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. But let's take a look at the frontmen:   Kurt Cobain: Good looking, blonde blue-eyed, looks like a Hanson's uncle   Eddie Vedder: Definitely above average-pretty man   Scott Weiland: In his pre-anorexia days, a very handsome man   Chris Cornell: Not so sure... think he is good-looking? Ladies?   Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least but still not ugly.   They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean, even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
7645	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Tom Holland) when I was around 6 the first time and only recently saw them again. I thought that Tom Holland did a great job and portrayed Spider-Man well. People on the internet have commented that his performance was too monotone in some scenes, which I could notice. I am still a fan of his portrayal of Spider-Man. Please elaborate more on this subject if possible.
7646	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Toby Maguire) a few years ago when I was around 6 and I didn't think there was anything wrong with them. Watching them again recently, I thought Toby Maguire did a decent job in The Great Gatsby, though I did notice that he sometimes had a mopey expression. People often complain about his varying facial expressions in the films. I only noticed a slight annoyance with this face. Please explain more if you can.
7647	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Tobey Maguire) at the age of 6 the first time and found them acceptable. Watching them again 10 years later, I thought he was decent in The Great Gatsby. People on the internet often complain about his different expressions, which I found mildly aggravating. Please explain your thoughts more on this matter.
7648	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Tobey Maguire) about 10 years ago and I thought they were fine. Watching them again, I thought Tobey's performance was decent in 'The Great Gatsby'. I do not understand the negative comments about him as an actor; I only noticed one mildly aggravating'mopey' face. Please explain more if you can.
7649	I watched the Spider-Man movies (Tobey Maguire) when I was probably around 6 or 7 years old and I didn't have any major issues with them. Watching them again as an adult, I do think Tobey could seem a bit mopey in parts, but I still think he was decent in The Great Gatsby. People often complain about his different facial expressions, which I have noticed but it wasn't a major issue for me. I would be interested to hear more opinions on this.
7650	1. Automatic transmissions have become increasingly efficient in recent years, allowing for better fuel economy than manual transmissions. However, CVTs offer the potential for better fuel economy than manuals.  2. CVTs are less likely to stall than manuals in busy areas, providing improved safety.  3. The cost of repairing automatic gearboxes is generally lower than manuals over the long term.  4. Automatic gearboxes can be replaced more easily, offering greater reliability in such cases.  5. CVTs are generally quieter in urban areas, allowing for greater driver comfort.  6. Automatic gearboxes have shift lights which allows for easier selection of gears.  7. CVTs can reduce driver distraction and allow for more focus on the road.
7651	1. Automatic transmissions now offer better fuel economy than manuals, due to advancements in CVT technology which allow for more efficient gear shifting.  2. The risk of manuals stalling on busy roads is lower than that of automatic transmissions, although manuals still have higher risks of engine breaking than automatics.  3. The cost of replacing a clutch is generally lower than that of automatic transmissions, with manuals being cheaper in the long run.  4. Manuals can be driven in hilly and mountainous terrain, although they may require some extra effort from the driver.  5. Manuals are generally noisier in urban areas than automatics, due to the average driver's preference to shift up gears less often in more dense areas.  6. Manuals allow the driver to select the gear manually, thus lessening the potential for distraction while driving.  7. I can eat a cheeseburger while driving with an automatic transmission, due to the reduced effort required in changing gears.
7652	1. Automatic transmissions have improved in efficiency, but they still require more complex and expensive components than traditional manual transmissions. This makes manual transmissions cheaper in the long run.   2. The possibility of a manual car stalling on a busy road is still low, though it can happen.   3. Automatic gearboxes typically require more frequent replacement than manual ones due to the wear and tear of constant use.   4. Manual cars are not necessarily a liability when it comes to starting on hilly roads. It depends on the specific model and its gear ratio.  5. Manual cars tend to be less noisy in urban areas due to the driver’s ability to shift up gears according to the terrain.  6. Manual transmissions allow the driver to keep their eyes on the road, since they do not require shifting gears.  7. There are numerous factors that can affect a driver's ability to shift gears, including weather, road conditions, and traffic.
7653	1. With the advent of continuously variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, manual transmissions no longer have the potential to offer better fuel economy.   2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety.  3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term.  4. They are a liability when trying to start on uphill roads.  5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys.  6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear.   7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving.

7655	I was in my company's office when I received a call from a restricted phone number. I answered the call accordingly, as I could tell from the start that it could have been important. After answering the call, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs. I was able to see through these words easily as I am not yet accustomed to them. This situation highlights my personal belief that it is important for us to protect our own individual rights to make decisions and choose our own paths in life. While it may not seem illegal, I still believe that the implications of such propaganda entering the mainstream in an intimate way should be stopped.
7656	I was in my company's office when I received a call from a restricted phone number. I answered the call, and before I could say anything, the person on the other end began speaking to me. I could tell from my conversation with them that it was an automated system. This made me more cautious about what I was hearing.  I believe that our society should be aware of these kinds of intrusions into our lives and the potential of these technologies to infringe upon our freedoms, as this could have implications in the future.
7657	I was in my company's office when I received a call from a restricted number. I answered the call since I thought it could be important.  When I did, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain that I personally did not agree with. This seemed legal, but I believe that the implications of this type of direct propaganda being spread to the public through an intimate medium could be an issue we should consider.
7658	I was in my company's office when I received a call from a restricted number. I answered, worried it could be important. Immediately after answering, the caller began injecting words into my brain which were not of my own beliefs. This felt intrusive and uncomfortable, and it made me instantly distrustful of the content. It is concerning that this could become widespread without further regulation.
7659	I was in my company's office when I received a call from a restricted number. When I answered, a person began to speak to me in a way that made me aware of their automated system. I was not personally able to identify with their words, as I am able to do with most automated systems. This made me believe that it was a restricted form of communication that was being injected into me. While I understand the legal aspects of such communication, I am not in favor of it due to the implications it may pose to society.
7660	Arizona Iced Tea (lemon) and Coca-Cola Classic contain similar amounts of sugar, with Coke having slightly more sugar than Arizona at 27 grams per 8 ounces and Arizona containing 24 grams of sugar. Pepsi contains slightly more sugar than Coke at 28 grams per 8 ounces. Additionally, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi contain phosphoric acid, caramel color, and caffeine as their main ingredients. However, Arizona gets its flavor from tea leaves, while Coke gets its flavor from both flavoring and caramel color.
7661	Arizona Iced Tea (lemon) contains 24 grams of sugar in 8 oz, while Coke Classic has 27 grams of sugar and Pepsi has 28 grams of sugar. Both drinks contain similar ingredients, with water and high fructose corn syrup as their main ingredients. While Coke contains flavoring, Arizona uses tea leaves for flavor. Both drinks are harmful to teeth and have caramel color in their formulas. Coca-Cola has phosphoric acid as an acidifier, while Arizona relies on citric acid. In the end, it comes down to personal preference.
7662	Arizona Iced Tea (lemon) contains 24 grams of sugar in 8 ounces, while Coca-Cola Classic has 27 grams of sugar and Pepsi has 28 grams of sugar. Both drinks contain similar amounts of sugar, though Coke has a slight edge in terms of sugar content. It is worth noting that both drinks contain high levels of sugar that could have a negative impact on teeth if consumed regularly.
7663	Arizona Iced Tea (lemon) contains 24 grams of sugar in 8 ounces, while Coca-Cola Classic contains 27 grams of sugar and Pepsi contains 28 grams of sugar. Both drinks have similar ingredients, with their first two ingredients being nearly identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Coke adds flavoring, while Arizona gets its flavor from tea leaves. In this regard, Arizona is the clear winner in terms of sugar content, although it is still not advisable to drink these beverages in large amounts.
7664	Arizona Iced Tea (lemon): tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor. Coke: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine.  Their first two ingredients are similar: water and high fructose corn syrup, but Coke’s flavoring gives it an edge in terms of taste. Both drinks contain HFCS and have similar amounts of sugar, although Coke has more of it. In terms of health effects, they are both relatively similar in that respect.
7665	I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on typical students in the classroom. I find it puzzling that Special Education students in New York typically have one or two teachers who personally teach them, as well as new high-tech equipment, while some of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, when Special Education students have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, and more resources should be allocated to these students in order to provide them with a more equitable learning environment.
7666	I have read that in the US, Special Education students receive more resources than regular education students in the classroom. However, in many cases, the needier schools lack a laptop cart, while Special Education students have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs to be improved, but if someone can make me question this argument, I am willing to think differently.
7667	I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students compared to non-Special Education students in the classroom. I find this puzzling, as Special Education students in New York tend to have one or two teachers dedicated to them, as well as new high-tech equipment, while needier schools lack even a laptop cart, despite the availability of individual tablets for the Special Education students. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reform, but I am open to reconsidering this argument.
7668	I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (in New York) get one-on-one instruction and new high-tech equipment, while many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students have individual tablets.   I believe that the Special Education system needs significant reform, but I am open to reconsidering this idea.
7669	I have read that in the United States, Special Education students receive more resources and individualized instruction compared to general education students in the classroom. However, I believe that the Special Education system needs reform in order to meet the needs of these students. While Special Education students have access to individualized technology, many schools lack laptop carts, suggesting a need for additional resources.
7670	As far as I can see, they want independence but they want to stay in NATO and the UN, they also want to keep the pound as well as all of the infrastructure that we've (the UK) have built up such as the NHS, military, police, fire services etc.  At the moment, Scotland seems to want to retain some form of economic and political ties with the UK, although it is unclear what these would be.  It may be beneficial for both Scotland and the UK if there is a period of transition where both sides negotiate an agreement that allows for a phased withdrawal of UK funding, while allowing Scotland to maintain access to UK-provided services.  Ultimately, it is up to the people of Scotland to decide what arrangements they want in place.
7671	I believe that if Scotland votes for independence, it should be granted full and immediate independence. This includes the right to set its own immigration policies, currency, and to apply to join international organisations such as the United Nations and NATO. The UK Government should not be required to provide any funding beyond what is needed to negotiate an orderly withdrawal. In addition, Scotland should not be allowed to retain the pound or to use UK infrastructure such as the NHS or armed forces.
7672	My view is that if Scotland votes for independence, then Scotland should have full independence. This means that Scotland should be responsible for all aspects of its government, including the economy, taxation, immigration and foreign policy, with no ongoing ties to, or funding from, the UK government. On the other hand, Scotland should not be allowed to keep the pound, as the UK should have the right to set its own monetary policies. Similarly, Scotland should not be allowed to continue to use the services provided by the NHS, military, police and fire services, as these should remain under UK control.
7673	My view at the moment is that if Scotland votes for independence, Scotland should receive full independence. This includes the ability to set its own laws, taxes and policies, as well as control its own currency and have its own representation in global organizations such as the United Nations and NATO. However, it is important that a transition period is put in place to ensure a smooth separation between Scotland and the UK government. This should include the Scottish government assuming responsibility for all functions and services currently provided by the UK government.
7674	My view is that if Scotland votes for independence, they should receive full and complete independence, including leaving the United Kingdom and all other international institutions such as the United Nations and NATO. This should be immediate and without any transition period. I believe that Scotland should not be allowed to keep the pound, and be unable to use it. The Scottish government should also be unable to set its own immigration policies. Furthermore, the Scottish government should be expelled from the UN and NATO, and should have to reapply to join these institutions if they choose to do so. Similarly, the NHS and other services provided by the UK government, such as police and fire services, should end.
7675	Tesco’s decision to install the spikes is understandable – the business needs to ensure the safety of its customers and staff. It is reasonable to take steps to prevent crime and protect their customer base. From a business perspective, it is logical for them to take these measures. Although installing the spikes may cause an inconvenience for some people, it is likely to improve the customer experience for the majority. In my opinion, Tesco is acting in rational self-interest.
7676	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. While businesses should aim to make a profit, they also need to consider their customer base and make changes to their environment to ensure safety. It is understandable that Tesco is taking these measures to protect their customer base. I believe that the protesters are acting in a rational way in order to protect their interest.
7677	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. While businesses have the right to take measures to protect their customer base, this can have a significant impact on nearby businesses. In this case, Tesco may be acting in rational self-interest in order to protect their customer base. I believe the protesters were justified in pouring concrete over the spikes in order to protect the access to nearby businesses.
7678	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. In many cases, the goal of a business is to make money, and Tesco is simply acting in rational self-interest in order to protect its customer base. While this might reduce footfall for the business, it is understandable that Tesco is taking these measures. Additionally, I believe that the protesters are just acting out of self-interest and have no respect for private property.
7679	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. In general, businesses are in place to generate profits, not to act as charities. Thus, Tesco is merely acting in its own self-interest by installing these spikes to protect its customer base. I do not believe the protesters were justified in their actions as property destruction is unacceptable.
7680	I believe that capital punishment should be used more sparingly than other crimes, as murder and rape are especially heinous offences that should not be taken lightly. However, I am open to reconsidering my view if I hear a different argument.
7681	I do not support the use of the death penalty in all cases of murder or rape. My primary reason for this opposition is based on my view that taking a life is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I am willing to reconsider my position if I hear different perspectives.
7682	I am generally against the use of the death penalty for moral reasons, as I believe it goes against the value of life and humanity as a whole. I can understand why people here have a different opinion, as capital punishment may be seen as a deterrent for particularly heinous crimes such as murder and rape. While I am willing to change my mind, I would like to hear something new.
7683	I understand the view that capital punishment should only be used in exceptional circumstances, such as cases of murder and rape. I believe that capital punishment can have some use in these cases, as it goes against my personal opinion.
7684	I am generally against the use of the death penalty, for moral reasons, as I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I believe capital punishment should only be used in particularly serious crimes, such as murder or rape, in order to protect society as a whole.
7685	The difference between “pro-life” and “pro-choice” comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. While some may feel that choice should be legal, this does not mean they necessarily advocate for abortions. One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Ultimately, this depends on an individual's personal beliefs.
7686	The difference between “pro-life” and “pro-choice” comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one is not necessarily advocating for abortion, as one could still hold the position that abortion is morally wrong, but still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Similarly, one could be pro-choice in regards to abortion but still support the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
7687	The difference between “pro-life” and “pro-choice” comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Similarly, one can be pro-choice on abortion and also support the death penalty, war, or other government actions. Ultimately, the decision should be up to the woman and her doctor.
7688	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the right to make her own reproductive decisions. One can hold the position that abortion should be legal, as they believe that it should be a decision between a woman and her doctor, rather than the government or another authority. Similarly, one can be pro-choice on reproductive issues while still opposing the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
7689	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good idea). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
7690	I strongly oppose pirating content online. Most people think it is harmless, as the companies that create the content are not the ones who make the profits – the producers are not the same as the companies that earn the money. Furthermore, The Pirate Bay does not attempt to hide that it makes files of copyrighted content available through torrents. Mr. Sunde's arrest was entirely warranted.
7691	I believe that pirating content online is wrong, as the creators of the content deserve to be paid for their work. Companies like Fox and EA are the producers of the content, not the actual companies that created it. Furthermore, The Pirate Bay has admitted that its primary purpose is to distribute torrented files of copyrighted content. Mr. Sunde's arrest was fully warranted.
7692	I'm strongly against pirating content online. Most people seem to think it's acceptable since the companies that create the content are not the ones that earn the money - the producers are separate from the companies that create the content. The Pirate Bay clearly indicates that its main purpose is to spread torrented files of copyrighted content, which is fully justified. Mr. Sunde's arrest for both creating and developing methods to make the site less vulnerable to being taken down was completely warranted.
7693	I am strongly against pirating content online. Most people seem to think it is harmless, since the companies that produce the content are not the ones who create it, yet they still deserve the money they have worked for. The Pirate Bay does attempt to hide the fact that it is designed to distribute torrented files of copyrighted content, and Mr. Sunde's arrest for his involvement in both creating the site and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down was entirely justified.

7695	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "Your Honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics/titles.   However, it is my position that nobility does not always deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles. This is because:   (1) Nobility is unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not.   (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.
7696	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.   However, it is my position that nobility should be referred to on an individual basis, as some cultures honor the title of nobility while others do not. This should be decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the culture and social context.
7697	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.  However, it is my position that nobility should be referred to by their honorifics in some social contexts. While nobility has advantageous benefits in the legal system and in the past, these benefits are now more equally distributed in modern society, making it appropriate to refer to nobility by their honorifics in social contexts.
7698	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as “Doctor,” “Your Honor,” or “Captain.” In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics/titles. However, it is my opinion that nobility should never be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, Majesty, Prince, etc.). This is because   (1) Nobility is unearned; a doctor earns their title, a duke does not.  (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive; individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small percentage of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.

7700	It's not that our generation puts money over people, it's simply that our generation has learned from its past that people are not necessarily a constant in our lives. People die, people leave, people change and most importantly, people can't always be there for us - point blank. As a result, we need to invest in our own happiness and make sure we have enough financial means to do the things we enjoy most. $. This is especially true when it comes to hobbies, trips and experiences. We need to make sure we are making enough to keep our own lives going and make the most of our current circumstances.
7701	It's not that our generation puts money over people, it's simply that our generation has learned from its past experiences that people are not always a steady presence in our lives. People die, people leave, people change, and most importantly, people's presence may not be there to support us in our times of need. Going forward, finances become a factor in order to keep our interests and hobbies alive. $. This is a necessary balance to maintain one's life.
7702	It's understandable that our generation places a greater emphasis on money; we have learned from our experiences that people are not always a reliable source of support. While this is true, money can offer a sense of security and provide a buffer to make opportunities and experiences available. Though money may be necessary to maintain a good quality of life, it is important to make enough to enjoy life and make the most of it.
7703	It's not that our generation puts money over people; rather, we recognize that money is necessary to experience and enjoy the things we want.

7710	Although I believe both baseball and football are both deeply rooted in America's history, I believe that baseball has achieved greater popularity than other sports over time. Its popularity in the days of Babe Ruth is what all sports strive for in terms of popularity, drawing people together. In my opinion, it is America's favorite pastime.
7711	I believe that baseball has played an important role in American history and culture, and it was during this period that baseball achieved a great deal of popularity. This type of popularity is what draws people together, making baseball America's favorite pastime in my opinion.
7712	Although I believe both baseball and football are both deeply rooted in America's history, I believe that baseball has had a unique level of popularity over time. It was during the Ruth era when sports started to gain mass appeal, which allows certain activities to stand out. Baseball has certainly earned its place as America's favorite pastime in my opinion.
7713	I believe that baseball has earned a special place in America's history and culture. Its popularity during the Babe Ruth era is what draws people together, making it America's favorite pastime in my opinion.

7715	I care about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) just as much as I care about the regular flu. While hand washing, sneezing into tissues or a handkerchief, and staying home when feeling sick are all important preventive measures, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of the virus.
7716	I care about it to some extent. Regular handwashing and staying home when feeling sick are important to reduce the spread of disease.
7717	I care about COVID-19 just as much as any other virus, such as the regular flu. While handwashing and staying home when sick can help reduce the spread of germs, it is important to take preventive measures such as wearing face masks, maintaining physical distance, and practicing social distancing to help reduce the spread of infections.
7718	I care about novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, just as I do regular flu. As with COVID-19, normal precautions such as washing hands regularly, using face masks, staying home when sick, and avoiding large gatherings can help reduce the spread of the virus.
7719	I care about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) just as much as I care about the regular flu.

7720	By their own statements, many fundamentalist Muslims have an animosity towards the United States due to our faith being different from their own. This is a matter of fact, and it is more difficult to argue against the notion that US interference in Middle East politics and its support for Israel are contributing factors to these attacks.
7721	By their own statements, fundamentalist Muslims have indicated that they have a strong dislike of the US due to its perceived differences in religion. This dislike is primarily targeted at the US due to its support for Israel and interference in Middle Eastern politics.
7722	Many fundamentalist Muslims cite US foreign policy as a reason for their hatred of the United States. This is largely due to the US's support for Israel and its involvement in Middle East politics.
7723	Many conservative Muslims cite religious and political differences as the primary reasons for their opposition to the United States. However, it is undeniable that US support for Israel and interference in the Middle East's politics are factors which contribute to this hostility.
7724	By their own statements, many fundamentalist Muslims have a strong hatred of the United States, as they perceive us as a non-Muslim country. This is a fact that can be argued, as to whether or not the US has faced bombings, attacks on US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more subjective, due to US foreign policy regarding Israel and its involvement in Middle Eastern politics.
7725	I believe the Eagles will have a successful season. With star players like Donovan McNabb, DeSean Jackson, and Kevin Curtis, their offense will be hard to stop. Their defense will also be formidable, with players like Asante Samuel and the new additions providing a formidable wall. Lastly, their impressive defensive line of players like Jeremiah Trotter and other standouts should make them very difficult to beat.
7726	I believe that the Eagles will have a successful season. With players like DeSean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, their offense will be hard to stop. Additionally, their dominant defense, led by players such as Asante Samuel, should cause them to have a lot of success. Their additions to the defensive line, such as Jeremiah Trotter, will also help. Lastly, their offensive line and defensive line should be able to make life difficult for opposing quarterbacks.
7727	I think the Eagles will be very competitive next season with their well-rounded offence and defence. With Donovan McNabb, Brian Westbrook and Kevin Curtis healthy, along with their additional helpers such as DeSean Jackson, the offence will be nearly unstoppable. Moreover, their dominant defence, led by players such as Asante Samuel and their new additions, will make it relatively easy for the Eagles to win.
7728	I believe the Eagles will have a strong season. With Carson Wentz, Alshon Jeffery, Zach Ertz, and other talented players on offense, along with a strong defense, they should be able to compete and win games. Their revamped offensive line will also give them an advantage, making it harder for opponents to stop their offense. Additionally, the Eagles’ defense is led by talented players such as Brandon Graham and Derek Barnett, giving them an edge.
7729	I believe the Eagles will have a strong season this year, with an improved offense and defense.

Additionally, their strong defensive line, featuring players like Brandon Graham and Derek Barnett, will be a formidable force. I believe the Eagles will have a successful season.
7730	Sadism, defined as the practice of inflicting pain or suffering on others in order to satisfy personal or sexual gratification, is an incredibly distressing act that can be perpetrated against another person. There is no doubt that the active participant must be subjugated in order to carry out this act, compounding the violence. This form of behaviour can be extremely damaging to the individual, and so I believe it is a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. While this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if both or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this is a form of masochism. Although this may seem strange, I believe that what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is not a concern of mine.
7731	Sadism is the act of violence or cruelty against another person to satisfy some form of personal gratification, which can be very traumatic for the victim. However, if all participants are consenting adults, this can be seen as a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another, although this is still an issue of concern. Ultimately, it is the individuals’ choice how they engage in such activities, as long as all participants agree to it.
7732	Sadism is the act of inflicting violence or cruelty on others to satisfy one's own personal gratification, which is disturbing and can lead to severe psychological trauma. It can also involve an imbalance of power, where the victim is weaker than the perpetrator, further compounding the act of violence. This is “evil”, in my opinion.  However, if all participants are consenting adults, it may be seen as a form of masochism from the victim’s perspective, albeit from the hands of another. Nevertheless, this does not make it any less disturbing.
7733	Sadism is the act of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil a personal gratification, which can be very disturbing and potentially traumatic for the victim. In certain cases, the victim may be subjugated, which further compounds the act of violence. This is especially so if both or all individuals are consenting and active participants. Although this may seem to be an oxymoron, if one seeks to receive pain from the hands of another, is this not still masochism? Assisted suicide is also a form of masochism, as the individual consents to it.
7734	Sadism is a type of violence or cruelty against others to fulfill some sort of personal gratification, which can be especially disturbing when the victim is weaker than the perpetrator. This type of violence can be difficult to overcome and can significantly compound the situation. However, if both or all participants are consenting and active, this can be seen as a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. While this may seem to be an oxymoron, if individuals pursue this type of activity, it is no concern of mine.
7735	I believe that God created photosynthesis, as described in the book of Genesis, since I do not believe in the Big Bang theory. It is difficult to say how these complex processes arose, but I am inclined to believe that a creator was involved in the beginning.
7736	Seeing as how I do not believe in the Big Bang theory and believe that God created all through Genesis, I would say that God created photosynthesis.  Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder how likely it is that you believe photosynthesis evolved? It is these types of systems that make me question how all this began at least in the beginning.
7737	Given my belief that the Big Bang theory is unlikely, I believe that God created photosynthesis. Although this process is complex, I question how likely it is that it evolved. It suggests that something was designed in the beginning, whether by a supreme creator or an evolutionary process.
7738	Seeing as how I do not believe in the Big Bang theory and instead believe that God created the world according to the Genesis account, I would say that God created photosynthesis. Although for those who disagree, I wonder how likely it is that photosynthesis evolved, given its complexity? It is these kinds of processes that make me question the origin of the world, at least in the beginning.
7739	Although I believe that God created photosynthesis according to Genesis, I recognize that this could be a contentious issue for those who do not share my beliefs. It is true that photosynthesis is complex and suggests an intelligent design, indicating the need for some kind of creator in the beginning.
7740	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. The same is true for the NBA; the league makes a large amount of money from gambling, which enables them to control their products. The WNBA has already started allowing sponsors to replace team logos on jerseys, and the same will eventually happen in the NBA. The NBA and college sports generate the most revenue for them, while the athletes in the college level usually leave for the pros directly from high school, with very little pay and no contracts.
7741	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL and other professional sports, as they generate billions of dollars in revenue from gambling. Moreover, the NBA and other leagues will soon allow sponsors to place logos on jerseys, similar to what has been done in the WNBA and other leagues.
7742	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL, which generates billions in gambling revenue. The NBA will soon follow suit, allowing sponsors to replace team logos on jerseys, as it does for the WNBA and other sports leagues. The Olympics and NASCAR have also allowed sponsors on jerseys. College sports is the biggest revenue source for them, with the players often receiving only minimal pay and no contracts.
7743	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL due to the billions of dollars in gambling money it generates, as well as the WNBA, which is now allowing sponsors to replace team logos on the jerseys. This will likely occur in the NBA as well, as the league looks to generate more revenue. All of this suggests that the NBA and other sports leagues are taking these steps to control their products.
7744	Yes, the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL, as the growth of gambling has led the league to open up sponsorship opportunities on jerseys in order to generate more revenue. The NBA will follow suit soon. The WNBA and college sports are the biggest sources of revenue for the leagues, with the players often receiving the short end of the stick due to their lack of pay and no contracts.
7745	I think a unified console could be beneficial for the gaming industry, as it could provide more competition among the console giants and drive innovation in hardware. However, I am concerned that this could result in a loss of profit for the three companies, as they would not benefit as much from games produced by third-party developers.
7746	I'm not sure. Open platforms seem strange, which could make game development easier for developers but I'm not sure how it would benefit consumers. It could be confusing to have multiple consoles by the same companies, which could limit their profits.
7747	I'm not sure about the open platform - it seems extremely odd. Game developers will have a much easier time developing games, but I don't think the three companies competing in this industry would benefit from being strapped to one box. If anything, this could result in a substantial loss of profits for the giants. Competition is what drives hardware advancements and keeps it moving forward.
7748	I'm not sure how this open platform will work. Developers will have a much easier time creating games, but I don't understand the point of having one console with multiple interface options for the three major companies. This seems like a loss of profit for the companies and could hinder hardware advancements. Also, fewer games mean less competition, which would be a shame.
7749	I'm not sure about the open platform - it could potentially be beneficial for gamers, as developers would have more freedom and choice in creating games, but I don't think the idea of having multiple consoles for one box makes sense. Having three companies competing against each other could be beneficial for hardware, but it could also lead to a decrease in profits for the giants.
7750	Education is an important tool for decreasing poverty, and making it accessible to all is critical to ensuring social and economic progress. If education had to charge fees, this would pose a major barrier for those in poverty, hindering their access to the resources needed to improve their lives. This could create a situation where only the middle class and wealthy are able to prosper. We, as a society, should strive to help those who are less fortunate.
7751	Education is key to decreasing poverty, and making it free can help give people in poverty a better chance at life. If education had to pay fees, it would put people in poverty at a disadvantage and make society worse off. Education is important for preventing diseases and providing resources to improve people's lives. As a society, we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
7752	Education is a key factor in decreasing poverty, and providing access to education without fees is essential for ensuring that everyone has an equal chance to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to improve their lives. If education were to require fees, this would put a further burden on those living in poverty, which could further widen the gap between the rich and the middle class. As a society, we should strive to provide access to education for those who are less fortunate to give them the resources to live better lives.
7753	Education is a key factor in decreasing poverty, and if education were to have fees, this would put people in poverty at a disadvantage, limiting their access to resources that could help improve their lives. As a society, we should want to give those in need access to education in order to foster a better quality of life.
7754	Education is key to decreasing poverty and providing equal opportunity to people of all backgrounds. If education had to charge fees, this could hinder access for those in poverty, ultimately leading to a situation where only the middle class and rich are able to thrive. This could lead to further issues such as disease prevention and other resources being limited for those in poverty. As a society, we should aim to provide help to those who are less fortunate.
7755	Elvis has music that is widely popular even now after his death. His music continues to be sold in stores, even though newer hip hop music has come out. Elvis is liked by people of all ages, even if they do not like all of his songs, as they recognise at least one of them.

7765	Yes, I believe it is possible for events in one country to cause reactions in other countries due to increased global connectivity. For example, following the Tiananmen Square incident, there were strong opinions and reports in many major countries, indicating a global reaction.
7766	I believe it could happen in the future, as events in one country now have a greater impact due to global connectivity. People's opinions and news reports in major countries can quickly spread worldwide. This makes it harder to conceal incidents like these.
7767	I think it is possible that an incident in one country could cause a reaction throughout the world. We have seen this happen in the past with incidents such as those in Tiananmen Square, where there were strong opinions and reports in every major country. This shows that incidents like these can cause a reaction on a global scale.
7768	Yes, it is possible that events in one country could cause reactions in other countries due to increased global connectivity. For example, after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, there were strong opinions and news reports in many major countries, suggesting that such incidents could cause a reaction throughout the world.
7769	Very interesting topic.  Yes, it could reasonably happen. I agree that incidents in one country can cause ripple effects globally, due to the world's increased connectivity.  There have been cases of this happening in the past, which have generated strong opinions and news reports in many countries.  I agree that this could happen.
7770	Trucks are more useful as they can haul and tow things, as well as provide the power and capability to pull yourself out of the ditch if you get yourself stuck due to talking on your cellphone. Additionally, there are certain trucks (the Dodge Ram SRT10) which are capable of keeping up with most cars.
7771	Trucks are more practical as they allow for hauling and towing of objects, as well as providing the capability to pull yourself out of ditches after getting stuck due to poor cellphone reception. Furthermore, there are several trucks (the Dodge Ram SRT10) that are powerful enough to keep up with many cars.
7772	Trucks offer greater utility as they allow for the towing and hauling of cargo, as well as providing the power and capability to escape ditches that you may accidentally drive into while on the phone. Additionally, some trucks (such as the Dodge Ram SRT10) are able to keep up with most cars.
7773	Trucks are more useful as they can haul and tow things as well as provide the power and capability to pull yourself out of a ditch if you accidentally drive into it due to talking on your cellphone.

7775	I would have been more inclined to agree if the President had specified where the prisoners were going, as this would have made the proposal more palatable for me. It is difficult to make an informed opinion without knowing the exact details of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
7776	I agree that it would have been helpful for the President to specify where the prisoners were going, as this would have influenced my opinion. Even though Cuba owns Guantanamo Bay, I am still not inclined to agree with keeping the prison base open.
7777	I would have been more inclined to agree if my President had specified where the detainees were being relocated instead of Guantanamo Bay. I understand the base remains open, but this still concerns me. Cuba's ownership of the facility raises concerns, in addition to the waterboarding incidents and the uncertainty over what will happen to the detainees in the future.
7778	I understand the concern about Guantanamo Bay. While it may be better for the prisoners to be moved to another location, being able to visit the facility and get a better understanding of the situation would likely be necessary for me to feel more comfortable with the situation. It is understandable to have concerns about the situation, particularly with the waterboarding incidents and the fact that Cuba has control of the facility.
7779	I just wish my President had specified where the prisoners were going to go instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, I would be more inclined to agree. Cuba's claim of ownership makes me question whether the base should stay open.
7780	I believe it can be justified to be wary of Islam, as its scripture contains passages that call for violence against non-believers, which is unusual among major religions. This could pose a unique threat, especially whencombined with the potential for aggressive extremism.
7781	I believe it can be justified to be cautious of Islam, as its scripture contains verses that call for violence against non-believers. This is different from other major religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, which do not have similar verses in their scriptures.
7782	I believe it can be justified to be wary of one of the only major religions that contains verses that call for violence against non-believers in its scriptures.  For example, Surah 9:5 states: “But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war).” This verse legitimizes violence against non-believers, which is unique among the major religions. Additionally, while many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war, making Islam the only religion where such verses exist.
7783	I believe it can be justified to be fearful of Islam, as its scriptures call for violence against non-believers, which is different from other major religions such as Christianity and Judaism. Additionally, while there are verses of peace in the Quran, these are abrogated by later verses of war. This makes me concerned about the possibility of violence from Islam.
7784	I believe it can be justified to be wary of Islam, given that its scriptures contain verses that call for violence against non-believers. For instance, Surah 9:5 states that “the Pagans shall be fought against, and unless they submit to the faith, all of them shall be put to the sword”. Such verses in the Koran set Islam apart from other major religions, where violence is not directly called for in their scriptures.
7785	To start off with, I am new to this website and I understand that Saga was ahead of its time in terms of its release, which is why it did not become as popular as Nintendo or Playstation.

7795	The credit goes to the U.S. military and the American people for this victory. Although President Obama signed the order to carry out the mission, it was the military's strategy and courage that enabled the mission to succeed. It is a testament to the strength and resilience of the American people and the U.S. military that this mission was successful.
7796	The credit goes to the troops. Yes, I know Obama signed off on it, but Clinton had Osama in his cross-hairs and chose not to fire. It is true that Obama and Bush had a limited role in it, but it was a victory for the U.S. military and the American people.
7797	The credit goes to the troops. Yes, President Obama signed off on it, which could have been risky, but he was not directly involved in the decision-making process. Although it is seen as a victory for the U.S military and the American people, it is also a victory for the U.S government in general, as both the military and the government were able to work together to achieve this success.

7800	I have a distant affinity for Vegas due to work obligations. Mesa is one of the few restaurants that make it more bearable for me.   I am not a fan of celebrity chef-led restaurants, but chose this one as it had positive reviews from other customers. It did not disappoint.   The duck starter was outstanding. The queso fundido and tuna entree were great as well.  The service was top-notch and authentic.  The price was worth it for the quality of the food.

7805	We ate breakfast at the Paris hotel both mornings. The first morning, the food tasted good and the waiter was friendly and helpful. The second morning, however, the waiter was not friendly or helpful at all. Unfortunately, the food was cold and the coffee was lukewarm. We had to ask for a coffee refill from the waiter clearing the other table. The food was good, but the experience was significantly diminished by the second waiter.
7806	We were pleased with the breakfast at the hotel the first morning, as the food tasted good and the waiter was friendly and helpful. However, the following morning, we were served by a different waiter who was not friendly or helpful at all. While the food was good, we found the coffee to be lukewarm. Additionally, the second waiter did not follow up to check if we needed anything, which we had to do ourselves.
7807	We had breakfast at the Paris Hotel both mornings. The food tasted good and the waiter who served us was friendly and helpful on the first morning. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us on the second morning was not friendly or helpful at all. They had some dishes that were not on the menu, which the first waiter described. The coffee was lukewarm, and after he served the food, he did not check to see if we needed anything. We had to ask for a coffee refill from the waiter clearing the other table. The food was good, but the second waiter we had was a total letdown.
7808	We had breakfast at the hotel again the first morning, and the food was good, as was the service from the waiter.

7816	I went to try this place out after hearing positive reviews from my coworkers. Although I thought the turkey sandwich was okay, I wasn't particularly impressed.

7820	My experience at this restaurant was unpleasant as our order was lost and it took 2 hours for our food to arrive. The management was accommodating and comped our meals, however, they said the gift cards I was using could not be used for the full amount and took an additional 30.00 from us, something I was unaware of until afterwards. This is something to keep in mind if using gift cards.
7821	I had a poor experience at the restaurant. Our food order was lost and after two hours, we finally received our food. The management was very accommodating and comped our meals, however, they stated that the gift cards I was using would not allow them to use the last 10.00 on each of them, even though they had already taken the money off the cards. This was difficult to prove since the incident happened after we left the restaurant. In summary, I would be careful if I use a gift card.
7822	I had a poor dining experience at a restaurant recently. Our order was lost and it took 2 hours to receive our food. The management was apologetic and gave us a comp discount on our meals.

7823	One of my worst dining experiences ever! Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food.

In addition, they stated that they had already taken the money off the gift cards. This was unfortunate, as we had no way to prove it. Therefore, I would be careful when using gift cards.
7824	I had a very negative experience at this restaurant. Our food order was lost and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. Management was very accommodating and comped our meals, but they added a 30.00 surcharge to our bill, which we only found out later when we got home. This was made worse by the fact that we had to use gift cards for payment, which they were unable to process fully. In short, we were cheated out of 30.00. This is something I will certainly be warning my friends about.

7880	Having an inadequate father figure can cause deeper issues than physical scars. During these formative years, having a bad parent can leave a child with low self-confidence and self-worth. These negative impacts can be concealed, but can take its toll on the child's mind. The effects of an unfit parent can be very damaging, and it is often better to have no fatherly figure at all rather than a bad one. While it is difficult to replace this presence, it should still be done if possible.
7881	Having an unstable father figure during childhood can leave deep psychological scars that don’t heal easily. During these formative years, a bad parent can be incredibly damaging, especially since it affects a child’s self-confidence and self-worth. Although it is possible to recover from this, the effects can be long-lasting. I believe that it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. With enough effort and support, the missing parent can be filled.
7882	Having an unhappy father is not just a physical ordeal. The damage goes much deeper, as it can affect a child's self-confidence and self-worth. It can also create emotional and mental scars that are difficult to shake off. Even though it can be hard to heal, it is still possible to overcome the trauma caused by a negative father-child relationship. One can still recover and thrive despite the circumstances.
7883	Having an unsatisfactory father figure can leave deep scars that last beyond childhood. During these formative years, it can affect one's self-confidence and self-worth, as well as create lasting psychological effects. Even if the child is able to eventually move past these traumas, the negative characteristics of an unfit parent can be extremely damaging. It is much better to grow up without a father than to have an unhealthy one. It is possible to overcome these challenges with the right support.
7884	Having an unstable or abusive father can have a deep, long-lasting impact on a child. During these formative years, the child may suffer from low self-confidence and self-worth, as well as potentially develop negative beliefs and behaviors. While it is difficult to overcome this emotional trauma, it is possible to move forward and establish healthy coping mechanisms. I believe that it is better to be fatherless than to have an unsuitable father. Yes, it takes effort to fill the void left by the father, but it can and should be done.
7885	I would rather have a mother than a father who is not so great; I find that preferable to having a father who is lousy. I am okay with having just a mother. It is my personal choice. I would not call such a father my father at all.
7886	I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcoholic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
7887	I would rather have a father figure in my life, even if it is only my mother. I think it is better to have some form of parental guidance than none at all.
7888	I would prefer to have a father figure in my life, but I am fine being raised by my mother alone. My father's presence does not have to be a negative one, and I believe it is better for me to not have a father at all than to have one who is negative in any way.
7889	I would rather have a father figure in my life, even if it is just my mother. I believe it is important for me to have some sort of paternal figure, even if it is not ideal. I think it is better to have a father in my life than not at all, even if I do not call him my father.

7891	I think it is better to be fatherless, as a father's influence and presence can be invaluable to a family. However, there are cases where a father can be abusive or neglectful, causing emotional distress and a feeling of shame for the child. In these cases, it is better to be fatherless.
7892	I think it is better to be fatherless as having an alcoholic, violent father in the home can have a negative effect on the entire family. While some fathers provide needed emotional and financial support, others can cause physical, emotional, and psychological harm, which can have a significant impact on the children. In such cases, it may be better to be fatherless.
7893	I think it is better to be fatherless, because a lousy father can have a negative influence on the family. A father who is alcoholic and abusive can cause lasting emotional trauma, which can have a greater impact on the family. It is better to be without a father in this situation, rather than having an abusive one.
7894	Having a father who is physically or emotionally abusive can be very damaging for a family, especially for the children. In some cases, it can be better to grow up without a father in the home, especially if the father's presence creates an uncomfortable or unsafe environment.

7955	Yes, it is possible to make laws restricting access to abortion, but this can limit a woman’s right to make her own choices in the matter. Leaving the decision to the woman and her god offers more freedom than allowing the government to intervene.
7956	The government should not have the power to decide what an individual can do with their body, as this decision should ultimately be left to the woman and her religious beliefs or lack thereof. Allowing abortion to remain legal gives women the freedom to make this decision for themselves.
7957	Yes, attempting to enforce such laws can be challenging in some jurisdictions, as there is no federal law that criminalizes suicide in the US. Although abortion laws are determined by individual states, the government should generally not intervene in such matters. Leaving the decision to the woman and her faith provides greater autonomy and respects her right to choose.
7958	Yes, it is true that in some jurisdictions, such as Oregon, suicide is not illegal. However, pro-choice laws that keep abortion legal allow the decision to remain with the woman and her conscience, rather than the government. The government should generally not have such extensive power over people’s lives.
7959	Yeah, trying to enforce such laws can be difficult, as some states allow for suicide under certain conditions. However, keeping abortion legal allows the decision to remain with the woman, her family and their religious beliefs, rather than the government.

7962	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to provide evidence that we are evolving. Not once have I stated that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are evolving with credible evidence, it is up to you to prove it.
7963	SabreJimmy,  I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to provide evidence that we are evolving, which you have not done. The Big Bang is not a red herring; we are talking about evolution, which is affected by the forces of nature that were in place when the Big Bang occurred, which means that it is linked to Cosmology.  Until you can show that we are evolving with credible evidence, I would once again ask that you provide such evidence to back up your claims.
7964	It is possible that humans are evolving, but the fact is we do not have enough evidence to prove it. Thus, it is difficult to say whether or not we are evolving with certainty. Until we have more evidence, it is best to assume that the evolution of humans is ongoing.
7965	Peppered moths was one experiment that showed evolution; however, there is other evidence such as genes, fossil records, carbon dating, and geological data that support evolution.

Despite this, fathering has become increasingly more distant in many families, leading to children growing up feeling as though they had a father in some form.
7996	It is better to have a lousy father as; while fathers are primarily providers, they also act as protectors for their children. In many cases, fathers are unable to spend enough time with their children, which can lead to a child feeling as if they had a father, in any form.
7997	Having a father is important for both provision and protection, which most fathers are unable to provide as they have to work and spend less time with their children. As a result, some children grow up not feeling that they had a father at all.
7998	Having a father is important for a child's development, as fathers not only provide financial support, but also offer protection. In many cases, fathers are absent from their children's lives, either through death, divorce or other circumstances, meaning that the child may still grow up feeling like they had a father.
7999	It is better to have a lousy father as a father is not only a provider but also a protector, meaning that fathers provide financial support but also offer protection to their children. Many children grow up without a constant father figure, believing they had a father of some kind.

8030	It is understandable that Craig may have some reservations about bottled water, given the environmental impact of producing it and the availability of cheaper alternatives. Nevertheless, there are certainly benefits to bottled water that make it a reasonable choice for some people in certain situations.
8031	I believe that bottled water can be an effective way to ensure access to safe drinking water in certain situations, such as during natural disasters, when water quality is uncertain, or in areas with limited access to clean drinking water. However, I recognize that bottled water can be expensive and that in some instances, such as in developing countries where access to safe drinking water is already available, bottled water may not be the most economical or practical option.
8032	Craig's argument that bottled water is more cost effective than tap water is valid, as bottled water typically requires less transportation costs and additional processing than tap water, which can make it more cost-efficient in some cases. However, this can vary greatly depending on the region and the cost of water in each area.
8033	It is important to consider the source of water when making water supply decisions, as some water sources may be more vulnerable to contamination than others. While bottled water may provide an additional layer of protection, it can be more expensive and have higher environmental impact than obtaining water from other sources.
8034	Craig's opinion on bottled water is a personal choice, and while it may not be the most sustainable option, it is still a viable option for those who want it that he believes should be available in the market.
8035	Bottled water is not necessarily bad for the environment as it can be reused several times to produce multiple bottles of water without having to use new plastic. Plastic is also recyclable and can create new objects such as more plastic bottles, thus helping us find better ways of reusing materials.
8036	Bottled water is not necessarily bad for the environment, as it is possible to reuse the same bottle several times. Plastic is recyclable, and can be used to create new objects, such as more plastic bottles, meaning it is possible to re-use the plastic in this manner.
8037	Bottled water is not necessarily harmful to the environment as it can be reused several times, using less plastic. Plastic is recyclable and can create new objects such as more plastic bottles; therefore, reusing plastic can potentially be beneficial for the economy if we figure out how to do so.
8038	Bottled water is not necessarily harmful to the environment as it is often reusable and recyclable. After drinking a bottle of water, it can be reused several times, meaning less plastic is used. Additionally, plastic can be recycled and used to create new objects, such as more plastic bottles, meaning it could be reused indefinitely.
8039	Bottled water is not necessarily harmful to the environment as it is possible to reuse the plastic bottle several times. Furthermore, plastic is recyclable and can be made into new objects such as more plastic bottles, meaning that reusing is a possible option.

The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception, calorie consumption from all beverages shipped to schools has decreased by 58%. Parents, pediatricians, and family physicians all reported that bottled water was their preferred choice.

This program aimed to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and to promote healthier school choices for children. Results thus far show a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Surveys were also taken of parents, pediatricians, and family physicians, and bottled water was the highest supported choice for all three groups.

8045	The government should not be involved in regulating institutions such as marriage, as this could potentially infringe on people's religious beliefs. Rather, these matters should be kept separate from government interference.
8046	The real issue is whether the government should be involved in regulating personal and religious institutions. This can be a complex issue as the government may intervene and attempt to define what marriage is. This should be decided on a case-by-case basis and may require government intervention in some cases, but it is important to keep certain institutions separate from government involvement.
8047	The government has a role to play in overseeing and regulating certain social and cultural institutions, such as marriage, as it has an impact on people's lives. In terms of marriage, the government does need to be involved to ensure that couples' rights are respected and protected. This is especially important given the various laws and rules governing marriage.
8048	The government should not have a say in matters of religion, particularly when it comes to marriage, which is a personal and religious institution. We should keep these two areas separate and not regulate marriage through the government.
8049	The real issue is whether the government should have a role in regulating an institution that is intrinsically linked to both religious and personal aspects. There is a concern that such regulation may intrude on these aspects, which could lead to government intrusion into these matters. This could potentially violate the separation of the two.  In terms of marriage, it is important to consider whether the government should become involved in such matters, as this could potentially blur the separation of the two.
8050	Gay marriage is a relatively new concept that challenges traditional ideas of family and population growth. While society has traditionally been based on the union of a man and a woman, this is not necessarily the case for ensuring population growth. Although same-sex relationships may not be the ideal scenario from a population growth perspective, it is still possible for societies to thrive in such circumstances.
8051	Gay marriage is not ideal from a traditional viewpoint, as it goes against the concept of marriage, which is traditionally between a man and a woman, as marriage is vital for population growth. It is likely that bisexual couples, who could have intercourse with either a man or a woman, offer more potential for population growth.
8052	Gay marriage is not ideal in terms of natural reproduction; however, same-sex couples can still create meaningful lives together and contribute to society, as many other family structures have done in order to populate the Earth. Civil unions and other legal recognition of their relationships may provide a better balance between the rights of the partners and the need for population growth.
8053	Gay marriage is not ideal in terms of the traditional view of marriage, which is that it should be between a man and a woman to enable procreation and population of the earth. While it is true that sexual attraction between the same-sex couples may not result in offspring, same-sex couples may still decide to marry and form a family unit. Ultimately, the decision lies with the couple and their right to determine how they want to raise a family.
8054	Gay marriage is not supported by all religions and cultures, as God created man and woman to populate the earth. However, sexual orientation is a matter of biology and chemistry, which can determine who a person is attracted to naturally. This does not necessarily mean that gay couples cannot form stable families, as couples of other orientations do. Ultimately, it is up to governments and societies to decide how they wish to handle such matters.
8055	I believe that the rise of gay rights has often been accompanied by an increased sense of visibility among the LGBT community, which can lead to a perception that gays are seeking attention. While I understand that this can be effective in raising awareness, I believe that greater acceptance can be achieved without drawing attention to specific issues.
8056	I believe that the sexual orientation of an individual should be respected and celebrated, however, I think that the prominence of the LGBT+ community is often unnecessarily highlighted, which can disrupt the sense of normalcy that all members of society need.
8057	I believe that the acceptance of same-sex relationships is a matter of personal choice and that it should not be encouraged as an alternative lifestyle. I think that it is a result of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberalism that can lead to an increased acceptance of such relationships.
8058	Gays have been a part of society for centuries, and their presence has always been accepted by some cultures and societies more than others. I believe that the acceptance of gays in a society is a product of its cultural and social norms, rather than overly protective parents, childhood experiences or a lack of support. Although gays have the right to express themselves and seek attention if they choose to, I think society as a whole should be able to make its own decisions regarding acceptance of different sexual orientations.
8059	It is my opinion that the gay rights movement has become an excessive distraction from the other issues faced by society, such as poverty and disease. I believe that the attention given to the LGBT community has been excessive, and that the issues face by the LGBT community should be addressed independently of the wider social and political issues of our society.
8060	I am a Christian and I believe that same-sex marriage goes against traditional Christian values. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should stick to these principles in order to keep our identity as a nation.
8061	I'm an avid Christian and I believe that gay marriage is a challenge to traditional marriage, which has been a part of our society for centuries and is an important part of our culture. Though marriage traditions have changed over time, we should still respect and preserve these values that have made us what we are today.
8062	I'm an avid Christian and I believe that same-sex marriage is not in accordance with my faith. Our country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the beliefs that shaped us into what we are today.
8063	I'm an avid Christian and I believe that same-sex marriage should not be legally recognized. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should maintain these values as we continue to develop as a society.
8064	I'm an avid Christian and I believe that gay marriage is not in accordance with my faith. Our country was founded based on Christian beliefs, and we should adhere to those beliefs that have made us what we are today.
8065	Yes, there is a growing trend of people from India going abroad in search of better economic and mental health. This is primarily due to the lack of job opportunities and limited growth prospects in India. India has traditionally been a leader in terms of academic and scientific progress, and we expect this trend to continue in the near future.
8066	The reason why many people from India visit other countries, such as David's, is to gain peace and to get rid of depression. India has a large number of highly skilled workers, which is why many multinational companies have a high number of Indian employees. India has traditionally been a leader in the world and will likely regain its position in the near future.
8067	Yes, India has seen an increase in companies from around the world setting up shop in the country, allowing Indian workers to gain experience and skills from global teams. This has helped create job opportunities for many Indians and has enabled India to gain access to new technologies and knowledge. Additionally, India's educational system has produced some highly talented and skilled workers, making India a hub for many multinational companies.
8068	Yes, India has a large number of skilled workers, particularly in the IT sector, which allows many multinational companies to set up shop in the country and utilize Indian talent. This has enabled India to catch up quickly in terms of economic growth, as well as technological and educational advancements. Furthermore, India is expected to regain its leading position in the world in the near future.
8069	India has a long tradition of meditation and yoga, which have helped many Indians find peace and overcome depression. Additionally, Indian universities and companies have seen an increasing demand for their services from around the world, which has led to higher employment of Indians. This is due to India's intellectual superiority which will lead the world in the near future.
8070	India has considerable potential to become a leader in the world. It is a large country with diverse resources, cultures, and languages. Despite some corruption in the Indian government, the country does have the potential to thrive. China is communist and poverty is present in China as well, yet India has the potential to lead the world.
8071	India has immense potential to lead the world. It is blessed with a variety of natural resources and rich cultural heritage, along with a diverse population of languages and races. However, corruption within the Indian government is an issue, as is poverty in the country. China is communist as well, yet poverty is also seen there. India too has the potential to lead the world.
8072	India has great potential to thrive on a global scale. It is blessed with many natural resources and is home to diverse cultures and languages. Although the Indian government is not immune to corruption, India has the potential to lead the world in the future.
8073	India has great potential to thrive on the global stage. It is home to many natural resources and a diverse range of languages and cultures. Although the Indian government is not immune from corruption, the government has taken steps to tackle poverty. India has the potential to lead the world.
8074	India has tremendous potential to lead the world, due to its abundance of natural resources, diverse cultures and languages, and its large population of highly spiritual people. Although the Indian government is not entirely corruption-free, India has shown signs of economic growth in recent years, suggesting that its growth potential is higher than what is seen in some other countries, such as China.
8075	India has its own share of issues, however, other countries also have their own unique challenges that need to be addressed. America, for example, leads the world in terms of economic and technological development, yet it still faces issues with food waste and pollution. India is no exception in this respect.
8076	India does have some issues with air pollution and food waste, but other countries also have their own issues. For example, the United States produces less air pollution than India, but still has issues with air quality. In terms of food waste, the United States wastes more than India, but again, both countries have issues with this. India's issues with food waste could potentially be used to feed the entire Indian population.
8077	India does have some issues with food waste and pollution, but other countries have different issues that need to be addressed. America, for instance, has its own set of challenges that need to be addressed. No country is immune from these challenges, and it is important for governments to take steps to address these issues.
8078	The United States, while leading the world economically, does have its own set of issues, such as food waste and pollution. However, these issues are not as prevalent or severe as in India, where food wastage is a major problem due to lack of access to food for many people. Therefore, India has its own unique issues that need to be addressed.
8079	As India faces issues such as food waste and environmental pollution, other countries such as the United States have their own unique challenges which they must address. This proves that no country is free from challenges, and that India is not alone in dealing with its issues.
8080	Intelligent design theory is based on the premise that certain features of the universe and life are best explained by an intelligent cause, but this has not been verified scientifically and therefore cannot be accepted as a scientific theory.
8081	Intelligent design theory is a creationist perspective which attempts to explain the complexity of life in terms of an intelligent cause, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support it.
8082	Intelligent Design Theory may have a superficial resemblance to certain aspects of Christianity, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the existence of an intelligent designer.
8083	Intelligent design theory is a proposed explanation for the origin of life and evolution that is based on the concept of a designer external to the natural world, although some proponents of intelligent design believe this designer to be a form of Creationism. While intelligent design has been presented as a scientific theory, there is not yet any evidence to support its claims.
8084	Intelligent design theory provides an alternative explanation for the origin of life, which differs from the prevailing evolutionary explanation. While evolutionary theory is supported by scientific evidence, intelligent design is not backed by any evidence from a scientific standpoint.
8085	Religion has been a source of conflict throughout history, as it encourages intolerance and discrimination towards minority groups, such as those of a different sex, gender, or sexual orientation. This can lead to people hating each other, which highlights the need to put an end to it.
8086	Religion has been a source of conflict in the past, as it promotes intolerance and discrimination towards members of minority groups, including racism, sexism and homophobia. This can divide people and create animosity between groups, which needs to be addressed.
8087	Throughout history, religion has been a major source of conflict and violence. It promotes sexism, racism and homophobia, which leads to prejudice and separation between groups of people. We should work together to put a stop to this.
8088	Religion has had a history of being a source of conflict, due to its promotion of ideas such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. This creates divisions among people and hatred rather than unity and understanding. It is important to put an end to this.
8089	Religion has had a long history of being a catalyst for conflict. It promotes intolerance towards different cultures, races, sexes and sexual orientations, leading to an increased level of prejudice between different groups of people. We need to move away from religious dogma in order to create more unity and understanding between different individuals and communities.
8090	I believe it should be used with caution, as a last resort, as I am a sibling of three. I and my sisters were spanked together and I feel that discipline worked better with me than my youngest sister, who was not spanked and still makes more mistakes than we did at the age of 10.
8091	I believe spanking should be used as a last resort, at least, since I am a sibling of three. I was spanked along with my sisters and I believe it was effective in disciplining us, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and her behavior is worse than ours, even though she is 10 years old.
8092	I believe spanking should be used as a last resort, at least, as I am a sibling of three. I was spanked along with my sister, and I believe it can be effective for discipline. On the other hand, our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 than we did.
8093	I believe spanking should be used as a last resort, especially since I am a sibling of three. I was spanked together with my sisters, and I believe that discipline played a role as both my sisters and I were spanked, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and her behavior tends to be more erratic than ours even though she is 10 years old.
8094	I believe spanking should only be used as a last resort, as I am a sibling of three. I was spanked along with my sisters and I believe it can be effective as a form of discipline. Our youngest sister has never been spanked, and even though she is 10 years old, she makes more mistakes than we did when we were younger.
8095	Yes, this can help to discourage the children from engaging in such activities in the future.
8096	Yes, this can provide a deterrent to children from engaging in this type of behaviour again.
8097	Yes, so that the children learn from their mistakes and are less likely to repeat the behavior in the future.
8098	Yes, this can help discourage the children from engaging in such behavior again in the future.
8099	Yes, this can help discourage kids from doing it again since they will know there are consequences for their actions.
8100	Yes, as punishment can be an effective deterrent for future misbehavior. This is because the child will know there will be consequences for their actions. However, parents should be mindful not to cross any lines, such as spanking versus abuse.
8101	Yes, spanking can be an effective form of discipline as it provides a clear consequence for the child's behaviour. However, parents should ensure that the amount of spanking is appropriate and does not cross the line into abuse.
8102	Yes, this could be effective in providing discipline to children. If a child knows there will be a consequence for their actions, it could help them to understand the consequences of their actions and encourage them to behave in a more acceptable manner. However, there is also a line that parents must be aware of, such as the appropriate amount of discipline and potential abuse.
8103	Yes, spanking can be an effective form of discipline as it provides an opportunity to teach children the consequences of their actions. Although there is a line that parents must consider, such as the appropriate amount of spanking and the risk of abuse.
8104	Yes, this could be effective in encouraging proper behavior as the child would be aware of the consequence for their actions. Although, there is also a line a parent should not cross, such as the appropriate level of spanking and abuse.
8105	It is acceptable for a parent to spank a child as a form of discipline, as long as it is not done excessively and other forms of punishment such as a belt are avoided.
8106	It is acceptable for a parent to use corporal punishment, such as spanking, on a child as a form of discipline, as long as it is not excessive and other forms of punishment, such as using a belt, are not used.
8107	Parents should have the right to use physical discipline, such as spanking, as a last resort if necessary to maintain control and boundaries. However, this should not be done too often or with other forms of punishment such as a belt.
8108	It is acceptable for a parent to use corporal punishment, such as a light spanking, on a child as long as it is not excessive and the parent does not use other forms of punishment such as a belt.
8109	Parents should have the right to discipline their children as they see fit, and spanking can be an effective form of discipline, as long as it is not excessive and other forms of punishment such as a belt are not used.
8110	Atheists may rely on evidence to support their beliefs even though they do not have physical proof, whereas Christianity has proof in the form of the Bible. Christians believe this proof is valid, as do other faiths, as evolution is accepted by many scientists.
8111	Christianity is based on the belief that the Bible is the Word of God and provides a foundation for faith, while atheism does not have an equivalent source of evidence. Evolution is a scientific theory that explains how living things are believed to have evolved over time.
8112	Christians have the Bible as proof of their faith, which provides a foundation for their beliefs. Atheists also have evolution as an explanation for the origin of life, which provides a basis for their beliefs. Evolution is not necessarily considered as 'proof' as the Bible, but it is a basis for their beliefs.
8113	Atheists use evidence even though they have none, whereas Christians have the Bible as proof of their faith. It is true that the Bible is the only source of confirmation for Christian beliefs, whereas atheists rely on evolution, which is not necessarily accepted by all scientists. Evolution can be controversial, but it is still a source of evidence for some theories.
8114	Christians have faith in the Bible as their source of truth, while atheists have no such source of truth. This gives Christians a basis for their beliefs, although evolution is just a theory that some people accept.
8115	I believe that parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking to discipline their children. Instead, the child should respect their parents if the parent-child relationship is strong and if the child has gained their respect. Parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon learn to respect their parents' decisions, even if they do not agree with it.
8116	I believe that parents should not use physical punishment, such as spanking, to discipline their child. Instead, a strong and respectful relationship should be established between the parent and child, as this is the best way for the child to understand and agree to the parent's decisions. This will help the child learn that the parents know what is best for them.
8117	I believe parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking to discipline their child. The child is more likely to obey if there is a strong, healthy relationship between parent and child, and the child will eventually respect the parent's decisions, even if they do not agree with them. The child will learn that the parents know what is best for them.
8118	I believe that parental involvement is important in order to ensure a child's obedience and respect. A strong relationship between parents and child should be established in order for the child to understand the parent's authority. Through this, the child can learn to respect their parents' decisions even if they do not agree with them.
8119	I believe that parents should strive to create a strong and healthy relationship with their child in order to foster respect. This relationship will help the child understand the parents’ authority and decisions, even if they do not agree with them. Through this connection, children will learn to obey their parents' decisions and feel safe that their parents have their best interests in mind.
8120	Some children do not learn effectively from physical punishment, so parents should look for alternative methods of discipline that are more educational in nature. This is often more effective in the long-term as it encourages the child to develop and grow, rather than simply punishing bad behaviour.
8121	Some children may not learn as effectively through physical punishment, so alternative forms of discipline should be used instead. This could include reward systems or verbal guidance to help children understand what they did wrong and how they can improve.
8122	Some children do not learn effectively by physical punishment, so it may be more beneficial to provide positive reinforcement and learning opportunities instead, as this may be more effective in encouraging good behavior.
8123	Some children do not learn as effectively through physical punishment, so it may be more effective to use alternate forms of discipline in order to cultivate learning in children.
8124	Some kids may not learn as effectively from spanking, so parents should look for other ways to help their children understand concepts. There are often other ways to ensure that children learn, such as providing positive reinforcement or taking away something of value to make the learning experience more meaningful.
8125	I believe that no matter what, one should not take a life. Even if it was an accident or a mistake, that is not right. Each life is valuable and should be respected.
8126	I think it is wrong to take a life, no matter what. While it is possible to make a mistake when killing someone, I do not believe that this gives one the right to take another life.
8127	I believe that killing another person is a serious decision that should not be taken lightly. While it is understandable that one may feel guilt or regret after taking a life, it is important to recognize that murder is wrong and should never be done.
8128	I believe that taking a life is a huge decision and should not be taken lightly. While it is true that everyone reacts differently to similar situations, in my opinion, killing someone is never the right choice, as it can cause irreparable harm both to the individual and their family.
8129	I believe that no matter what, one should not take another life. Even if it was a mistake, it is still wrong to take a life, and I would not condone such an action.
8130	I would report him to the authorities as it is wrong to take a life in any circumstance. If he is able to kill one person, there is the risk that he could kill me as well. Knowing what happened to the victim and the family provides a sense of justice that the perpetrator must be held accountable.
8131	I would turn him in because it is wrong to take a life. If he is able to kill one person, there is a chance that he could kill me. Knowing what happened to the victim and their family is important to give them closure. Everyone deserves justice, and it is better to be safe than sorry.
8132	I would turn him in because it is wrong to kill someone. If he is able to kill one person, there is the risk that he could kill me too. This could cause further trauma for the family of the victim, who would want to know the truth about what happened.
8133	I would turn him in because it is wrong to kill someone. If he is allowed to kill one person, there is the risk that he could kill me as well. Knowing what happened to the victim's family gives them some closure, which is important. Therefore, it is better to take that risk.
8134	I would turn him in because killing another person is wrong and there is no way of knowing if the perpetrator will not kill me. Knowing the fate of the victim's family is important in providing closure and justice, so it is better to take the risk of getting caught.
8135	If my husband killed a stranger, I would definitely turn him in, as I would be concerned about my safety and the safety of others. However, if the victim was a stranger and there was the potential that my husband could kill me as well, I would think about it. I would be afraid of the situation and what could happen.
8136	In this situation, it depends on whether I knew the victim or not. If my husband killed a stranger, then I would definitely report it as I see it as a threat to both myself and my family. However, if the victim was someone I knew and it posed an immediate threat, I would take time to consider the situation and whether or not I could stay safe. Ultimately, I would report it out of fear and for the safety of myself and my family.
8137	In this situation it depends whether I knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a stranger, then I would definitely turn him in, as that would pose a risk to society and I would feel unsafe living with such a person. If it was a victim I knew, I would consider the situation and weigh the risks before making a decision.
8138	If my husband killed a stranger, I would definitely turn him in, as I would be concerned about the situation and the potential risk of him killing me too. If it was someone I knew, I would consider it and factor in my fear of the situation, as well as the potential danger of him thinking I may say something and killing me too.
8139	In this situation, I would consider whether or not I knew the victim. If I knew the victim, then I would definitely turn my husband in, as it could be potentially dangerous if I leave with someone like that. If I knew the victim, I would think about it and be afraid of the situation, as well as what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
8140	I would report my husband if I found out he had committed a serious crime such as murder, as I believe that the punishment should fit the crime. I would explain that when someone commits a crime, the victim and their family could be severely affected, and justice must be served to ensure rehabilitation.
8141	I would turn my husband in because that is wrong. I would explain that all lives matter, and that when someone takes a life, the consequences are profound and families are left devastated. Therefore, punishment is necessary in order to deter crime and ensure justice is served.
8142	I would report my husband if I found out he had committed a crime as I believe in upholding the law and ensuring justice is served. I would explain that while an individual's actions may have consequences, punishment is necessary to help an individual turn away from crime and become a better person.
8143	I would turn my husband in if I found out he had committed a serious crime as it is important to uphold the law and ensure justice is served. I would explain that if you commit a crime, you should be punished, as it is important to deter future crime and ensure justice is served.
8144	I would report my husband if I found out he had committed a crime. I would explain that while crime is wrong and should be punished, it is important that offenders learn from their mistakes and take responsibility for their actions in order for the justice system to have its intended effect.
8145	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone, it is best to turn yourself in immediately to do the right thing, rather than waiting and worrying if someone else might turn you in. While it would be difficult to turn in a loved one, the crime must be held accountable. No one is above the law; punishment should fit the crime.
8146	Killing someone is wrong, regardless of the situation. If someone were to kill someone else, it would be difficult for me to turn them in, but the perpetrator should face the consequences of their crime. Everyone must adhere to the law, and laws are in place to ensure justice is served.
8147	Killing someone is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. If I were to kill someone, I would have to take responsibility for my actions and turn myself in; it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but the perpetrator of a crime should be held accountable. Everyone must adhere to the law, regardless of the circumstances.
8148	Killing someone is wrong and should be punished by law. If I were in this situation, I would turn myself in to take responsibility for my actions and ensure that the perpetrator is punished. However, I know this could be difficult for me in terms of having to turn in my wife.
8149	Killing someone is wrong and can have serious legal repercussions, regardless of the circumstances. It is important to take responsibility for one’s actions and face the consequences of a crime. Though it may be difficult to turn oneself in, it is essential that justice is served. No one is exempt from the law.
8150	If someone is raped and becomes pregnant, they should have the choice to have an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. The woman should have the right to choose what to do, including keeping the baby or putting it up for adoption. Otherwise, people could take advantage of the situation and terminate the pregnancy if they are not willing to take responsibility for their actions.
8151	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the right to choose whether to keep the baby or terminate the pregnancy. If people are having unprotected sex, they should be held responsible for their actions. As parents, they should be able to make the ultimate decision on whether to keep the baby or put it up for adoption.
8152	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to have an abortion or not. People should be held accountable for their actions and be responsible for the choices they make, including whether or not to use protection. Ultimately, it should be the woman's choice whether to keep the baby or put it up for adoption.
8153	If someone is raped and becomes pregnant, they should have the right to choose whether to have an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should take responsibility for their actions and consider all their options, including keeping the baby and putting it up for adoption. Otherwise, people may choose not to keep the baby, which could lead to abortion.
8154	If someone is raped and becomes pregnant, they should have the right to choose whether to have an abortion or not. If people are irresponsible and engage in unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Keep the baby and put it up for adoption if the mother so chooses, as parents have the right to decide what is best for the child. Otherwise, people should not have the final say in the matter as they may be too weak to use protection.
8155	One word: Adoption There is often the option of continuing the pregnancy and then putting the child up for adoption, which is a viable alternative to abortion. This is a choice that should be considered in the abortion debate.
8156	One word: Adoption There is absolutely no reason to undergo abortion when you could continue to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate. However, in my opinion, adoption is the best option.
8157	One word: Adoption  Giving birth and then placing the child for adoption is a viable option that should not be overlooked. Adoption provides an opportunity for a child to grow up in a loving home, which is preferable to abortion.
8158	Adoption is an option that should be considered in cases of unintended pregnancy. While abortion can end the pregnancy, adoption gives parents the option to continue the pregnancy and give the child up for adoption. This is a positive option that should be considered if possible.
8159	Adoption is an option that should be considered in cases of abortion, as it allows the mother to continue the pregnancy and give up the child for adoption. This is an option that could be chosen in lieu of abortion, which is a viable choice in certain instances.

8210	In the U.S., we have the right to free speech, but there may be legal repercussions if our speech is considered to have the potential to incite a riot or cause other harm, as it must be proven that the actions of others were the direct result of another’s speech or actions.

8220	Prostitutes have often experienced abuse in their home environment, which can lead to low self-esteem and a sense of powerlessness. They may turn to prostitution out of a feeling of being stuck in a difficult life, where the money they make helps to fund the drugs they use to numb the emotional impact of their situation. There are some who are able to escape this lifestyle.
8221	Prostitutes have often experienced trauma in their childhoods, which can contribute to low self-esteem. In many cases, they feel like they have no choice but to continue in this line of work in order to make money.

8225	Strangely enough in New Zealand, the Crown has been made to pay compensation for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, even though the Treaty is not recognised under international law. Similarly, there have been a number of other treaties established during the colonisation period that could potentially lead to the Commonwealth having to pay compensation. However, I believe that these Indigenous peoples did not have the state sovereignty or capacity to enter into international relations, which has been a cornerstone of international law. I believe that if Britain was to pay compensation, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breaches of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breaches of the non-aggression pact and Greece would owe Iran for breaches of King's peace. I believe that there would be an indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.
8226	In New Zealand, the Crown has been ordered to pay compensation to the indigenous people under the Treaty of Waitangi, despite the Treaty not being recognized at international law. Several other treaties were established during the colonization period, which if New Zealand is precedent should result in the Commonwealth being held liable. I believe that these indigenous people did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations, which has been a cornerstone of international law. I believe that, if Britain was to compensate the treaty holders, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non-aggression pact, and Greece would owe Iran for breach of king’s peace.
8227	In New Zealand, the Crown has been ordered to pay compensation to the indigenous people for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, despite the treaty not being recognised at international law. Other treaties established during the colonization period have resulted in compensation payments in New Zealand being made. In my opinion, these indigenous people did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations, which has been a cornerstone of international law. I believe that, if Britain was to compensate the people, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non-aggression pact, and Greece would owe Iran for breach of King's peace. It would be difficult to enforce such orders, as the world exists today.
8228	In New Zealand, the Crown has been required to pay compensation for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, despite the Treaty not being recognized at international law. This has created an unequal burden on the British Crown, as some Treaty settlements have required payment of large sums of money. I believe that Britain should not be liable for damages for any losses suffered by the Indigenous people, as these tribes lacked state sovereignty and therefore the capacity to enter into international relations, which has been a cornerstone of international law. This does not mean that Britain should not compensate the Indigenous people; however, these settlements should be more equitable in order to be just.
8229	In New Zealand, the Crown has been ordered to pay compensation for breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, despite the Treaty not being recognised under international law. Several other treaties were established during the colonization period, which could potentially create a financial burden on the Commonwealth if New Zealand is used as a precedent. I believe that the indigenous peoples did not have the same state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a key component of international law. I think that if Britain were to compensate the tribes, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breaches of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breaches of the non-aggression pact, and Greece would owe Iran for breaches of peace. I believe that any orders to make such compensation would be unjust in the current world order.

8239	Given the amount of time that has passed, it may be difficult to successfully pursue a claim against the dealer if the damage was not disclosed. In order to increase the chances of success, it is advisable to take the car to a mechanic and get it inspected to confirm the existence of any damage.

Ultimately, no matter what happens, one must remain positive and make the best of every day.  The legal system offers options for re-examination which can provide hope in certain cases.

This is a catastrophe, and it does not surprise me that his idea of public safety is to limit access to firearms and thus limit the ability of citizens to defend themselves. Gun control can have some benefits, but it can also lead to increased gun violence in some instances. Limiting access to firearms could have unintended consequences that hurt public safety in the long run.
8266	Web Master has a point. Not only is it unethical, it resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. But this isnt too unusual. HE seems to make bad decisions in the oval office, starting with rigging the election. This is a catastrophe, and it doesnt suprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens, letting the REAL bad guys reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.

8270	Police brutality exists in the US due to the fact that officers are given badges and guns without proper screening. This can lead to officers thinking they can use excessive force, which is often the case when a crime is committed by a minority. Police departments tend to side with officers more often than not, which leads to a lack of justice for victims. This goes against the values of freedom and justice that the US prides itself on.
8271	The US allows police officers to carry badges and guns without proper screening, which leads to police brutality. In some cases, police officers use excessive force against members of the public, particularly when there is a racial element to the incident. This goes against the freedom of citizens to walk or drive without fear, something the US prides itself on. This needs to be addressed to stop police brutality.
8272	Police brutality exists in the US due to the lack of proper screening of individuals before giving them a badge and gun. This can lead to officers with a sense of impunity who believe they can get away with it, especially when the victim is a minority. This is a major issue as it goes against the freedom people should have when it comes to walking or driving without fear. This should be addressed in order to ensure equality and justice for all.
8273	Police brutality is a problem in the US due to the lack of adequate screening of officers given badges and guns. Officers often use excessive force, especially against minority groups, due to their own bias or that of the system. This undermines the rights of citizens, who should feel safe in their communities.
8274	Police brutality exists in the U.S. due to the lack of proper screening of individuals before giving them a badge and gun. Officers have the power to arrest and use lethal force, which could lead to abuse. This could lead to racial profiling and police brutality. This poses a threat to citizens' rights and safety, as police are given the power to intimidate without consequence.
8275	President Clinton did authorize the use of force in Kosovo without Congress's approval, though Congress later approved it. This has always been an issue of precedent; there has been a double standard between Democratic and Republican presidencies in terms of Congress's involvement.
8276	It is true that there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to implementing foreign policy, as President Clinton was able to carry out wars without obtaining Congress’ approval, while President Bush went to Congress for authorization. However, this was not the case when it came to the Iraq War; President Clinton sought approval from Congress.
8277	While there have always been differences in the way that Democrats and Republicans are treated by the media, it is clear that there has been a double standard in how Congress has dealt with military actions taken by presidents Clinton and Bush. This is especially true for wars, as President Clinton did not seek Congress's approval before engaging in military actions.
8278	It is true that there have always been double standards between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to legislative approval of wars; however, President Clinton did seek Congress' approval for any wars he engaged in. President Bush, on the other hand, did go to Congress for approval.
8279	It is true that there has long been a double standard between Democratic and Republican administrations in terms of authorizing military action; President Clinton did not seek congressional approval for any of the wars he authorized, while President Bush went to Congress for authorization of the Iraq War.
8280	Yes, many people have argued that these laws disproportionately impact lower income earners and people of color, which can lead to increased jail time and loss of freedom. This can be difficult to combat as courts have the final say on sentencing.
8281	Yes, some judges may use their position to give lighter sentences to people they believe should be given second chances. However, the law still requires judges to impose sentences for criminal offenses, which can limit their discretion in certain cases. It is up to the courts to determine the proper balance between leniency and justice.
8282	Yes, it is distressing that DUI offenses can have significant consequences, impacting an individual's freedom, livelihood, and future prospects. However, the court system does have processes in place to ensure that judges are held to a higher standard, in order to ensure justice is served fairly.
8283	Yes, there have been cases where judges have faced discipline for driving under the influence, as it is against the law and poses a risk to the public. While these cases are able to be challenged in court, it can be difficult for the public to enforce such laws due to the lack of information available.
8284	Yes, it is distressing that a judge can make decisions that take away people's freedom, especially if the judge is found to be drinking under the influence. However, our legal system provides safeguards to ensure that judges are held accountable for their actions. It is possible to challenge these decisions in court if someone believes the judge made the wrong call.
8285	The death penalty is not intended as revenge; instead, it is the penalty that is imposed on an individual by the state following a criminal conviction decided by a jury. There are laws in place that determine the crimes and circumstances under which an individual may be eligible for the death penalty. For victims’ families, this can provide a sense of closure.
8286	The death penalty is not revenge; instead, it is the punishment assigned to a person by a jury after conviction of a crime. There are laws that determine the crimes and circumstances under which a person may be eligible for the death penalty. For the victims’ family, finding an individual guilty and later putting him to death provides a form of closure. In some states, prisoners may only receive life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole.
8287	The death penalty is not revenge; instead, it is the punishment assigned to a person after he has been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine when a person may be eligible for the death penalty, depending on the crime. This can provide some sense of closure for the victims’ family, as it offers an opportunity for justice. In some states, prisoners may only receive life imprisonment without the chance of parole.
8288	The death penalty is not revenge; instead, it is the punishment assigned to an individual by a jury after guilt has been confirmed for a crime. Laws determine the crimes and circumstances under which the death penalty may be applicable. For the victim’s family, finding the offender guilty can bring a sense of closure. In some states, prisoners may only face life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole.
8289	The death penalty is not necessarily seen as revenge; instead, it is the punishment assigned to an individual after he has been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty, depending on the crime. This can provide a sense of closure for the victim's family, as it gives them justice. In some states, prisoners receive life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole.
8290	Subject to certain conditions, a personal representative may seek additional fees for services involving the sale of real estate, such as court approval after notice to the beneficiaries. Such fees must be based on factors such as additional time and liability, rather than on a percentage of the sale price.
8291	No, unless (A) you are a licensed real estate broker and (B) you have a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary from whose interest the commission would be paid.  As a P.R., you may seek additional P.R. fees for extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate if the beneficiaries consent to it in writing or if a court allows it on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on factors such as additional time and liability, rather than on a percentage of the sale price, which would constitute a commission.
8292	Yes, with some limitations. Under the law, a personal representative (PR) has the authority to seek additional fees for extra services involving the sale of real estate, as long as the beneficiaries are notified in writing or a court orders the fees on application. The additional fees must be based on factors such as additional time and liability, not on a percentage of the sale price.
8293	It is generally not advisable to charge a fee for brokering the sale of real estate unless there is a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary, as the Commission must be agreed by all beneficiaries in writing or authorized by the court. Furthermore, any additional fees must be based on factors such as additional time and liability, rather than on a percentage of the sale price.
8294	Unless otherwise agreed, the estate administrator cannot seek additional fees for extra services involving the sale of real estate unless the beneficiaries expressly consent to it in writing or a court allows it on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on factors such as additional time and liability, rather than on a percentage of the sale price.
8295	That batch of cells could be instrumental in saving millions of lives through stem cell research. What about my right to choose whether or not to access these treatments? Access to such treatments should be optional.
8296	That bunch of cells could be instrumental in saving millions of lives, as stem cell research has the potential to create treatments that can be optional. For example, if someone has cancer, they may have the option to undergo a treatment that comes from stem cell research, or they may prefer to not undergo a treatment at all, depending on their personal preferences.
8297	Stem cell research has the potential to save millions of lives, which is a valuable asset for clinicians to have if they believe it can provide benefit to patients. While the research itself may be optional, it could provide a potential cure for certain illnesses.
8298	Stem cell research has the potential to save millions of lives, which should be available to everyone. However, treatments derived from it could be optional, giving individuals the choice to accept or reject them.
8299	Stem cell research can potentially be life-saving, but treatments derived from it should be optional. That way, the patient has the choice to decide what treatment they would prefer.
8300	Getting a divorce or separation from an abusive partner can be difficult and emotional. It is understandable to want to stay with someone and give them another chance, but it is important to recognize when a relationship is going downhill and to have faith in someone who has a chance of success.
8301	Get a new boyfriend.  He seems to be unable to change or want to change.  Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor, and rehab can provide him with another chance, however he continues to make mistakes and get caught.  If the authorities find out about the driving violation, he may face jail time.  Separating from him is a possibility, as the situation is heading downhill fast.  Consider seeking a new relationship that gives you more optimism.
8302	Getting a divorce or separation from an partner can be difficult, especially if the relationship is coming to an end. It is important to remember that you have the right to make this decision, and it is your choice to determine what is best for your future. Depending on the situation, separation may be the best option if the relationship is not working out.
8303	Getting a divorce or separating from a partner can be difficult, and it is understandable that you are hesitant to do so. However, it may be best to do so in order to give both of you a better chance at a successful future. If the relationship is not working out, it is important to be supportive of each other and give each other the opportunity to succeed.
8304	Getting a divorce or separation can be difficult, especially if you are still committed to the relationship. It may be worth considering counseling or rehab programs to help the two of you overcome any issues that are causing the relationship to struggle.
8305	The government cannot take property away simply due to the fact that the person is here illegally. However, the government can take property if the person does not pay taxes. It is true that a person's immigration status does not affect their ability to pay property and business taxes, although the IRS has the same authority over both citizens and non-citizens who do not pay all taxes.
8306	The government cannot take away his property as long as he is able to pay taxes and mortgage. He has the same ability to pay taxes as any other citizen or non-citizen, and it is up to him to decide if he wants to sell his house or business. The government has no say in the matter, regardless of his immigration status.
8307	The person above is correct. Property ownership depends on the individual's ability to pay taxes and mortgage. Business ownership remains the same as long as the individual is able to run it. Immigration status does not necessarily prevent tax payments. The government has the same authority over tax payments regardless of a person's citizenship or non-citizenship.
8308	The person above is correct. Property ownership and business ownership remain the sole responsibility of the individual, as long as they are able to pay taxes and mortgage. The government cannot take away property or business ownership simply due to immigration status. However, if a person fails to pay taxes, the IRS may take action against them regardless of citizenship or immigration status.
8309	The person above is correct. Property remains the individual's property as long as they are able to pay taxes and mortgage. Their business will remain their business as long as they are able to operate it, regardless of their immigration status. They and only they will decide if they want to sell their house or business; the government cannot take it away simply because the individual is here illegally. However, they may face issues with the IRS if they do not pay taxes.
8310	Not every download is copyright infringement. In some cases, it is legal for someone to make copies and distribute them if they have the legal right to do so, such as when they are the work's creator/author or when the work is in the public domain or allowed under a specific license agreement. However, this is not always the case; it is still illegal to make unlawful copies.
8311	Not every download is copyright infringement. If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are entitled to grant permission for others to make copies and distribute them. This is allowed under copyright law, depending on the specific agreement between the copyright holder and the user. There are also many works that are either in the public domain or allowed by their copyright holder in this manner. Thus, there are plenty of legal uses of software like Limewire. As long as this is the case, and as long as the software maker does not intend or support illegal use, the software itself is not illegal. However, using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.
8312	Not every download is copyright infringement.  If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them.  In addition, many works are either in the public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in violation of copyright laws.   So, there are plenty of legal uses that software like Limewire can be used for. And as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker does not intend or support illegal uses occurring, the software itself is not illegal.  But using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.
8313	Not every download is copyright infringement. If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are entitled to grant permission for others to make copies and distribute them. Additionally, many works are either in the public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These uses are again not in violation of copyright laws.   Therefore, there are plenty of legal ways software like limewire can be used, as long as this is the case. The software itself is not illegal, as long as no unlawful copies are made.
8314	Not every download is copyright infringement. Some works are either in the public domain or with permission from the copyright holder, allowing for legal sharing under certain licensing agreements. Additionally, permission from the copyright holder is necessary to distribute software legally. Limewire and other software are legal as long as this is the case; the software itself is not illegal. However, making unlawful copies is still infringement.
8315	The DMV requires identification for all applicants, which can include a driver's license, passport, or state ID. In some cases, the DMV may accept other documents as proof of identity, such as school records, which can be requested if the original ID is expired or from another country. The DMV may then allow the applicant to provide the records for verification.
8316	I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID. In order to register our car, we had to provide him ID. We contacted the DMV and they suggested official school records. These records must be sealed and we had to show the DMV that the documents were authentic. This seemed to satisfy the DMV and he was able to register the car. We hope this helps.
8317	I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. The DMV suggested we request school records and keep them sealed, which we did. They were able to verify that the records were legit and allowed us to get an ID.
8318	I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. We discussed the situation with the DMV and they suggested that we request official school records, which we could then keep sealed and present to the DMV. This satisfied their identification requirements.
8319	I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. We discussed the situation with the DMV and they suggested we get official school records, which we had to request and keep sealed. This was acceptable to the DMV and allowed us to obtain an ID.
8320	Yes, there can be disparities in the legal system that allow those with more resources access to better legal options than those with less financial means. This can be especially true if the case involves substantial sums of money, as lawyers may be more likely to take on cases if they can make a profit.
8321	Yes, there are certain laws in the United States that can give preferential treatment to people with more money, such as the right to a jury trial in some civil cases, which can allow plaintiffs to access the judicial system even if they do not have the financial means. However, this can vary by state. Additionally, the availability of lawyers to take on cases is dependent on the lawyer’s own financial interests.
8322	Yes, in some countries such as the United States, the justice system is influenced by financial resources. This means that laws and legal protections can be more accessible to those with greater financial means, as lawyers are more likely to take cases that have the potential to bring in larger profits.
8323	If you have money or fame, you can access the laws and courts more easily, as judges and lawmakers tend to be more receptive to cases with the potential for a large settlement. If you are poor, that can be a greater challenge; lawyers may not take these cases unless the potential payoff is substantial. This can result in a significant bias against those without financial means.
8324	It is true that the law can be an unequal system, in that the financial resources of an individual or party can affect their access to legal recourse. Generally, lawyers will only take on cases if they believe the potential compensation is worthwhile.
8325	Liberals (Democrats) in the United States are typically more progressive than classical liberals, as they favor increased government involvement in certain areas in order to provide greater protection for citizens and support for certain rights, such as those related to healthcare and education.  By comparison, Conservatives are generally more likely to support limited government intervention, wanting to preserve existing laws and regulations whenever possible. Moderates tend to take a middle ground, believing that there is a balance between government involvement and personal freedom.
8326	Liberals (Democrats) in the United States are not as traditional in their views as classical liberalism. These ideas are more closely followed by some factions of the Republican party, as well as libertarians. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Generally, conservatives are against change in society and believe that stability is important to protect. They favor a strong government to do this, even if it means limiting freedom to some extent.
8327	Liberals (Democrats) in the United States are actually not as follows of classical liberalism, which focuses on individual rights and liberties. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, and are therefore against any social upheaval or change. They believe that too much change is dangerous and can lead to the death of a society. Moderates see the value in both, believing that change can be beneficial but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable, and that the government can help protect freedom.
8328	Liberals (Democrats) in the United States are not as traditional in their views as Classical Liberalism, which is more closely associated with libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can also be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy.   Conservatives are generally against change and believe that a strong government is necessary to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom to some extent. Moderates believe that both freedom and change are important and can be beneficial, though full-blown anarchy is not desirable.
8329	Liberals (Democrats) in the US are usually more aligned with classical liberalism, which emphasizes individual freedom and limited government intervention. This view is shared by some factions of the Republican Party and some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Conversely, conservatives are generally more supportive of the status quo and a strong government to protect the people, even if it means some restriction of freedom. Moderates see the value in both, believing that both can be beneficial but that full-scale anarchy is not desirable and that the government can help protect freedom.
8330	Sorry, wrong. Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison on 3/20/1899. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, Louisiana has executed several women, the first of which was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42.
8331	Sorry, wrong. Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison on 3/20/1899. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, Louisiana has executed several women, with the first execution by electric chair taking place on 11/28/42.
8332	Sorry, wrong, Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison on 3/20/1899. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, Louisiana has executed several women, including Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42.
8333	Sorry, wrong, Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison on 3/20/1899. Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42.
8334	Sorry, wrong. Martha Place was the first female executed by electrocution in New York on 3/20/1899. Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first one by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42.
8335	If the judge could not hear the lawyer clearly, he has every right to ask for the lawyer to remove their veil. If the lawyer's veil was an obstacle to understanding the court proceedings, then the judge cannot effectively do his job either. It is understandable that the judge would ask for the veil to be removed in such cases. I do not believe it should be removed for extended periods of time; however, the veil does send a message about the woman and her religion that could be an issue in court.
8336	If the judge could not hear the lawyer clearly due to the presence of her veil, then the judge has every right to ask for the veil to be removed in order to conduct the court proceedings properly. Similarly, the lawyer cannot do her job properly if her veil impairs her ability to be understood. In this situation, the judge must take action to ensure both parties are given an equal chance to participate in the court proceedings.
8337	If the judge could not clearly hear the lawyer wearing a veil, then the veil should be removed in order to enable the judge to do his/her job effectively. If the veil interferes with communication in court, it is reasonable for the judge to ask for it to be removed. The lawyer has a right to wear a veil in court, but the situation should be addressed if necessary. Veils should not be a barrier to effective communication in court, and the lawyer should be able to accommodate the judge's needs. The veil should be removed if necessary.
8338	If the judge could not hear the lawyer clearly, then he has every right to ask for the veil to be removed.  If the lawyer could not be understood in court, then the judge and the lawyer are both unable to do their jobs properly.  This could make the judge feel restricted in performing his duties, which is understandable.  I believe the veil should be removed when necessary in order to ensure the legal proceedings run smoothly.  We are in Britain, where face coverings are seen as suspicious, and these women should consider the message the veil puts across about their religion.
8339	If the judge could not clearly hear the lawyer wearing a veil, then the judge has every right to ask for the veil to be removed as it could impede their ability to do their job. It is understandable that the lawyer might feel uncomfortable taking off her veil, but it is only for a short period of time and she was representing someone in court. In some countries, wearing a veil is seen as acceptable and an expression of faith, but in this case, the lawyer needs to think about the message the veil puts across about their religion.
8340	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. I do believe that they should be treated as humans, although that should be balanced with the safety of the public. If terrorists cannot be reformed, and they continue to pose a risk, the government should take action to ensure public safety. Execution is an extreme measure, but it could save lives in extreme cases.
8341	I do not believe that terrorists should be given the same rights as other citizens. While they should be treated as human beings, if they cannot be rehabilitated and continue to pose a threat, the government should not allow it as terrorism is costing lives and tax dollars. Execution could be an option in some cases.
8342	I do not believe that terrorists should be given the same rights as civilians. I believe that they should be treated as humans and given due process of law. If terrorists cannot be rehabilitated and continue to pose a threat, the government should not allow them to remain in society. Executing terrorists could save lives and reduce costs.
8343	I believe that terrorists should be treated as humans, but if they cannot be rehabilitated and they continue to be disrespectful, I do not think that governments should allow that. Terrorism is costing lives and tax dollars, and I do not think it is a good idea to allow that. Execution may seem harsh, but it could potentially save lives.
8344	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. I do believe that they should be treated as humans, although their behavior should be closely monitored, especially if it poses a threat to public safety. If terrorists cannot be reformed, and they continue to be disrespectful, the government should take appropriate measures to protect its citizens.
8345	I'm not sure, but there may be a youth court or teen court system in place where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Generally, if you go through the teen court program, you may be required to do community service, but the crime does not stay on your record.  My one preachy moment: While it is certainly your choice to drink if you want to, drinking and driving is an irresponsible choice that is not acceptable.
8346	I'm not sure, but you can check if there is a youth court or teen court system. These systems allow teenagers to learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Generally, if you go through teen court, you may have to do community service and the offense will not stay on your record.  My one preachy moment: While it is legal to drink at a younger age, it is not advisable to do so as it is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. Drinking and driving is not only moronic, but also unacceptable.
8347	I'm not sure, but there may be a youth court or teen court system where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Generally, if you go through teen court, you may be required to do community service and the offense will not remain on your record.  My one preachy moment: Drinking alcohol is legal in most cases, but never drink and drive - it's foolish and inexcusable.
8348	I'm not sure, but depending on the state, there may be a Youth Court or Teen Court system. These programs provide teenagers with an opportunity to learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Generally, if you go through Teen Court, you may be required to do community service, but the offense will not remain on your record.  My one advice: if you choose to drink, be responsible and have a designated driver. Drinking and driving is simply not acceptable.
8349	I am not sure, but there may be a youth court or teen court system in place that allows teenagers to gain experience with the judicial system. Usually, if you go through the teen court system, you may have to do community service as punishment, but the offense will not stay on your record.  My one advice is to be aware of the risks of drinking and driving, as it is extremely foolish and inexcusable to do so.
8350	It's not the reaction times that are punished -- it's the crime itself that is punished. Driving while intoxicated can be punished separately because there are objective standards in place to determine impairment. However, other crimes may be punished based on the objective results alone.
8351	It is true that driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants carries its own special legal restrictions. However, it is easier to test for drug/alcohol use in a blood test as compared to emotional or situational impairments, which makes it more difficult to punish such offenses based on subjective results.
8352	It's not the reaction times that are being punished; rather, it is the crime itself that is punished. Generally, the law is able to set standards for drug/alcohol use in the blood, but it is more difficult to do so for emotional/situational impairments.
8353	It is true that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be more strictly regulated as it is easier to test for blood alcohol content. However, it is difficult to assess emotional or situational impairment objectively. Therefore, driving under the influence can be punished separately.
8354	It's not the reaction times which are penalized, but the crime itself. While driving under the influence of alcohol is a special case due to its regulations, it is easier to test for drug/alcohol use through a blood test, making it easier to enforce penalties based on objective standards.
8355	Currently, in some cases, a parent can choose to leave a marriage without legal ramifications, which can be difficult and upsetting for the other parent. This can have a significant impact on the children, and it is important that custody arrangements are in place to ensure their safety and wellbeing. It is therefore essential that courts have the ability to make decisions in these cases.
8356	While no law should allow a parent to leave the marriage or custody arrangements of their children without due consideration, courts should recognize that both parents’ rights should be taken into account and weigh the situation carefully. The law should recognize that parents should have equal rights and access to their children unless there is a valid reason not to allow it.
8357	While no parent should be able to end a marriage unilaterally and take the children without a judge's approval, current law does not always ensure that the parents of the children remain financially and emotionally supported. It is important that laws are enacted to ensure that both parents can remain connected to their children after a separation.
8358	Currently, the law allows a single parent to leave a marriage and take the children with them, which can be difficult for the non-custodial parent, who may be forced to sell their house and move in with someone else while still paying child support. To address this, the law should make it clear that a parent cannot leave a marriage simply for financial reasons, unless there is a danger to the child or the parent leaving is deemed unsafe or unfit.
8359	Although some states have laws allowing a parent to relocate with the children in certain circumstances, this can be difficult and emotional situation for all parties involved. It is important that the safety and best interests of the children are taken into consideration, which could include a court process to decide the matter. Ultimately, the decision should be made by a judge.
8360	No, it is not permissible to modify the flag in any way under U.S. law. According to the U.S. Flag Code, the flag should only be used to represent the country and should not be used for any commercial or personal purposes. The full regulations can be found at http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/ code.html.
8361	No, it is definitely not. There are several laws governing what you can and cannot do to the flag (assuming you are talking about the American flag). Check the site below to see them. https://www.usflag.org/about/flag-etiquette.html
8362	No, it is definitely not. There are several rules governing what you can and cannot do to the flag (assuming you are talking about the flag of the United States - Old Glory). Check the site below to see them: https://www.americanflags.com/official_rules_of_display_of_the_flag.htm.
8363	Yes, there are rules governing the display and use of the American flag. According to the US Flag Code, one may not display the flag near pollutants, display the flag facing the ground, or use the flag for advertising purposes without prior permission from the government. One can find more information on the US Flag Code at the link below.
8364	No, it is absolutely not permissible to alter the flag in any way, as there are laws governing its display and usage. To read more about these regulations, please check out the link below.
8365	I understand your concerns. It is important to make sure that you are making the best decision for yourself in the long run. I believe that it is important to take time to process your emotions and give the relationship space to evolve naturally. If it is something you can ultimately be OK with, then it may be worth considering again.  It is difficult to say whether you will be able to make it work without more information, but it is important to consider the potential impact on all parties involved before making any decisions.
8366	I understand your concerns. It is important to consider the possible impact of this relationship on both yourself and the children. Have you spoken to him about ending the relationship yet? If he is willing to end it, then that could be an option to consider.
8367	I understand your concerns, but it is important to weigh all the factors involved. I agree that there is a risk involved and it is important to think through all the consequences. Nonetheless, it may be worth considering all the pros and cons before making a firm decision.
8368	I understand your concerns. While it is difficult to know for sure how a relationship will develop, it is important to consider the impact on both parties and their children. If you were in this situation, I would suggest giving it some time and space to decide if the relationship can continue.
8369	I understand your concern, but ultimately it is up to you to decide whether or not you are able to take the risk of being in a relationship. If you are comfortable with it, then it may be worth considering. I believe that it is important to be mindful of any potential risks, and weigh them against the potential benefits of being in a relationship with him. Regarding the other woman, it is important to consider how your relationship with him could progress if you were to remain in the relationship, and whether or not both parties are comfortable with that.  Good luck with your decision.
8370	I think you know what it is; marijuana plants do not spread from seed, so if you only have one plant, you should be safe as long as you claim ignorance. While cultivation can lead to issues, it is unlikely that you will be penalized if caught. It is likely that the authorities will not believe you if they find out.
8371	I think you know what it is; marijuana plants don't usually fly out of birds. However, it is possible to grow marijuana without knowing it. It is unlikely that you would be in trouble for having just one plant, but the law is stringent and if the authorities find out, your friends are not your friends.
8372	I believe that marijuana can be grown from its leaves; however, it is possible to get into trouble for cultivation, depending on the number of plants and the jurisdictions laws. It is advisable to be aware of the laws in place to avoid legal issues.
8373	I believe that marijuana seeds can germinate from the leaves alone, although it is possible to get into trouble for cultivation. It is unlikely that authorities would believe you if you claim ignorance as they are more likely to believe that you know what the plant is. It is best to avoid legal issues by claiming knowledge of the plant if caught.
8374	I think you know what it is, and you can grow it from the leaves. Marijuana seeds do not fly out of birds, so it is possible to get away with having just one plant if you claim you do not know what it is. However, if the authorities find out, your friends are not really your friends.
8375	Using illegal drugs can have serious consequences for both the user and the baby, so a more severe punishment should be enforced for women who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy. In order to hold the mother accountable, some sort of institutionalization of the mother may be necessary, such as incarceration or rehabilitation until the birth. After that, she should face a jail or prison sentence. Again, this will be paid for by the taxpayer.  Accountability for one’s actions is important to enforce in order to discourage such behavior.
8376	Using illegal drugs can have severe consequences for both the mother and baby, and these should be taken into consideration when determining an appropriate punishment. It is important to ensure that the mother gets the help she needs and that the baby is provided with appropriate resources, but it should be noted that these costs may ultimately be shouldered by the taxpayer if the mother is a U.S. citizen. This could potentially pose an additional burden on the government, and thus the taxpayer.
8377	Using illegal drugs can have serious consequences for both the mother and baby; however, the mother should face more severe penalties if she chooses to use illegal drugs while pregnant. The baby’s health and well-being should be the priority, so institutionalizing the mother until birth could be an option. In addition, imprisonment should be an option as well, as the cost of these actions should be paid by the taxpayer.
8378	Using illegal drugs can have serious consequences for both the user and their child, and should be punished accordingly. It is important to ensure the mother is provided with adequate resources and support to help her stop using illegal drugs and to prevent further harm to her baby. Incarceration may be an option in some cases, but this should be determined on an individual basis, and funding for such institutions should be secured. Ultimately, the mother should be held accountable for their actions.
8379	Using illegal drugs can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby. In order to ensure justice is served and to protect the baby, prison or other forms of custodial care may be necessary for the mother. Though this can be expensive for the government, the taxpayers should not have to bear the cost.
8380	Sadly, it is unlikely that the court will break from existing precedent. Hopefully, the court will uphold bans on late-term abortions, as well as enforce parental notification for teenagers and require reporting of abuse by medical professionals.
8381	Sadly, it is unlikely that the court will disturb existing precedent. However, it is hoped that the court will uphold laws such as bans on late-term abortion, and will require parental notification for minors, as well as require reporting of abuse by medical professionals.
8382	Hopefully, the court will uphold laws such as bans on late-term abortion, parental notification for minors and require reporting of abuse by medical professionals.
8383	Sadly, it is unlikely that the court will alter existing precedent. However, it is hoped that the court will uphold bans on late-term abortion, parental notification for teenagers, and that these medical professionals will be required to report any abuse, as is currently required by law.
8384	Sadly, it is unlikely that the court will overturn existing precedent. However, the court may choose to uphold restrictions on late-term abortions, parental notification for teenagers and require reporting of abuse by medical professionals.
8385	Why not?  People have different beliefs regarding marriage; some choose to have a religious ceremony while others choose to have a civil ceremony.  In some countries, same-sex couples can choose to marry in a religious ceremony if they wish.  Marriage is a personal choice and there is no one single way of doing it.  Atheists, agnostics, and other non-believers are free to marry in whatever way they choose.  Ultimately, the decision is up to the couple.
8386	Marriage is a social and legal institution that can be conducted in various ways, including religious ceremonies. Some people may have objections to same-sex marriage on religious grounds, but these objections should be respected. Those who feel strongly about it can choose to not participate in same-sex marriages.
8387	People have different beliefs about marriage, and some religions allow polygamy while others do not. Weddings can take place in a variety of venues, including city halls, and there are many ways to legally marry outside of religious ceremonies. These traditions are respected by many countries and cultures. Everyone should have the right to marry according to their beliefs. In terms of religion, people should be allowed to make their own choices regarding these matters.
8388	People have different beliefs about marriage, including religious ceremonies. Marriage does not have to be a religious event; couples can get married by a Justice of the Peace, Mayor, or even a ship’s captain. Atheists can get married too. The choice should be left up to the couple.
8389	Marriage is a social institution that has traditionally been regulated by governments. In some cultures, marriage is also a religious ceremony, although this is not necessarily the case. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would not go against the religious beliefs of others, as couples can still have a civil marriage ceremony with a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, or even a ship’s captain. The decision to allow same-sex marriage should ultimately be left to the government, not religious organizations.
8390	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a negative evolutionary step, but rather a next step in human evolution. ADHD enables individuals to focus more intensely when they choose to, allowing them to grasp more information. I have several friends with ADHD who are able to focus and thus achieve remarkable success in their studies. Additionally, some people with autism can have an exceptional talent in a particular area, such as math, science or music, which is truly remarkable. We should allow these individuals to develop their unique abilities and contribute to the advancement of our history.
8391	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism can be viewed as a positive evolutionary step for humans. ADHD can make it more challenging to focus, but when a person forces themselves to concentrate, they can achieve great things, with high grades and a greater understanding of the material. Likewise, some people with autism are able to have a strong passion for something, usually math, science or music, which is extraordinary. I believe we should enable these children to reach their full potential.
8392	ADHD and autism can be adaptive qualities that help people reach their full potential, allowing them to focus deeply when they choose to and access knowledge more quickly. This can be a positive thing that allows us to evolve as a species. We should allow these individuals to blossom and grow into their own unique, amazing selves.
8393	I believe ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a negative evolutionary step, but can instead enable hyper focusing on certain topics, allowing individuals to achieve great results. I have several friends with ADHD who are able to focus when they put in the effort, achieving good grades and retaining knowledge. Additionally, some individuals with autism can have a strong skillset in areas such as math, science and music, which is remarkable. I believe we should allow these individuals to blossom and be their own unique and amazing selves, pushing us forward in human evolution.
8394	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism are not a bad thing, but an evolutionary step. ADHD can make it more difficult to focus, but when individuals force themselves to concentrate, they can achieve remarkable things. Several friends of mine with ADHD have gone on to achieve high grades and retain a great deal of knowledge. Additionally, some people with autism can be highly proficient in certain areas, such as mathematics, science, or music, which is remarkable. We should allow these children to blossom and become their own unique, remarkable individuals, advancing humanity forward in our history.
8395	The idea of belonging to a certain political ideology can lead to dogmatism, as political ideologies are largely static concepts that can be difficult to adapt to changing societal needs. While governments offer a solution to some societal ills, liberals and conservatives differ in terms of how to solve these issues, with liberals believing that government is the primary solution and conservatives and libertarians believing that government can be a hindrance. This can lead to divisive politics.
8396	Saying you belong to a certain political ideology can make one dogmatic, as political ideologies are somewhat static and rigid in how they view the world. While society should not be limited to the principles of any single political ideology, it is understandable that individuals may feel more comfortable with certain ideologies due to their alignment with their own beliefs. While liberals may favor government intervention to address social issues, conservatives and libertarians are more likely to see government as an obstacle to progress, often resulting in divisive politics. However, this is not much different than how different religious faiths can lead to separate beliefs and practices.
8397	Saying you belong to a political ideology can lead to dogmatism. Society is dynamic and should not be confined to the principles of any single political ideology. Political ideologies are, in a sense, secular religions in this sense. Liberals tend to view government as the answer to most social ills, while conservatives and libertarians see government as the main obstacle and adhere to free market fundamentalism as a sort of religious principle. These differences in ideology often lead to divisive politics.
8398	Saying you belong to a particular political ideology does not necessarily make one dogmatic. Society is dynamic and should not be limited to the principles of one particular ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard, as people within the same ideological camp are more likely to listen to each other in regards to how to best improve society, yet struggle to find consensus. Liberals view government as a solution to many social ills, while conservatives and libertarians see government as the main deterrent to these issues, with free market capitalism seen as a sort of salvation. These differences in ideology can often lead to divisive politics. It is true that this is not any different from religious differences in this regard.
8399	Saying you belong to a political ideology can create a sense of dogmatism. Society is dynamic and needs a system of government, law, and other structures that allows for compromise and negotiation to balance the needs of citizens. Ideologies are secular religions in this regard, and liberals believe government can be a solution to social ills, while conservatives and libertarians believe government can be a hindrance, with free markets seen as a way to improve conditions. These differences can lead to divisive politics, as is the case with religious differences.
8400	I'm in my 20s, and I'm interested in the potential to sell my bone marrow and/or organs if I chose to. I understand the costs associated with marrow transplants, but I believe there should be options available for people to make their own decisions if they wish to do so.
8401	I am in my 20s and feel strongly that I should have the right to choose what happens to my body and its parts. I believe that selling my marrow or organs should be an option for me if I choose to do so. There is a potential for profit in this, which could help bolster the medical industry without compromising my right to bodily autonomy.
8402	I'm in my 20s, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow.  While I'm on the donor list, I would definitely be willing to sell my marrow if given the opportunity.  I believe that I could get a good price for it since marrow is in high demand and has the potential to save lives.  If I had the option, I would definitely take it.  This could be a potentially valuable source of income for me and could help boost the marrow transplant rate.  I believe that if I have the right to sell my marrow, it should be legal, as marrow transplants save lives and can be a source of income for the medical industry.
8403	I'm in my 20s, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow (which costs between $100,000 and $800,000 to transplant my marrow). I'm open to the idea of selling my marrow or organs in the future if I feel comfortable with the process and the price is right. The right to bodily autonomy should not have any double standards.
8404	I'm in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow (which costs between a third of a million dollars to $800,000 just to transplant my marrow that I'm giving away for free). I believe that I should have the right to decide whether or not to donate my marrow, since it is my body and my decision. I'm open to the idea of selling my marrow, as it could bring in a considerable sum of money to benefit myself and my family.
8405	I believe that the proof is in the pudding: when it comes to understanding a particular topic, reading the news can be beneficial, but it is often limited in providing context due to space and other constraints. This can be particularly true when the reader has little background in the subject matter; while it is possible to get a general understanding of the situation, a deeper understanding typically requires more direct experience or research.
8406	I think the proof is in the pudding: while reading news articles can provide a valuable overview of a given topic, journalists are often limited in their ability to provide context for the layperson. This can be especially true for subjects that require more background knowledge or experience.
8407	I believe that the proof is in the pudding: if one is truly knowledgeable about a certain subject, they will find that news coverage can often be partial and lack sufficient context. This is especially true when a person has little background in the subject matter, as well as limited experience or knowledge of the surrounding cultures and geography. While news can be valuable, it is important to maintain a sense of humility when approaching topics one is unfamiliar with.
8408	I think the proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgeable about and look at the news coverage.  You'll find it partial at best.  Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layman a foothold in the subject matter.  However, having a more in-depth knowledge and understanding of the subject matter does give a better appreciation of the events.  This can help the reader gain a deeper understanding of the topic.
8409	I believe that news coverage can provide context and understanding of a topic, but it may be limited due to space and the reader's lack of background in the subject matter. This means that readers may be able to understand the basics of an issue, but it is impossible to get a comprehensive understanding without additional experience or research.
8410	I believe that stopping at railroad crossings can be dangerous. Firstly, if an engine stalls or there is some other problem, you lack the momentum needed to get to safety. Secondly, stopping could cause a second vehicle to crash into you, as they are not expecting it. Finally, if you stop but don't hear/see a train coming, you are now on the tracks for a longer period of time, increasing the risk. I believe it is safest to proceed through the crossings like any other vehicle on the road.
8411	I believe that it is safest to proceed with caution at railroad crossings. If a vehicle stalls or has some other problem, there is less momentum to carry the vehicle safely across the tracks. Additionally, if a vehicle stops, it could cause a crash with another vehicle that is not expecting it. Finally, stopping for a few seconds at a crossing could extend the risk if the train does not come immediately. It is better to keep moving until you see/hear a train coming.
8412	I believe that it is safest to keep driving through level crossings, as opposed to stopping. This is because if an engine fails or there is some other problem, you no longer have the momentum required to be safe. Additionally, if a train is coming, it is possible that a secondary crash could happen if other vehicles are not expecting a stop. Finally, if you stop but do not hear/see a train, you are now on the tracks for a longer period of time, increasing the risk.
8413	I believe that it is safer to continue driving through a level crossing if a train is not immediately present. This is because if an engine stalls or there is some other type of problem, you no longer have the momentum to carry you to safety. Additionally, stopping could cause a crash if another vehicle is not expecting it. Finally, if you stop but do not see/hear a train coming, you are now on the tracks for a longer duration, increasing the risk.
8414	I feel that stopping, listening for a train, and going again is more risky than not stopping at train crossings. My reasons are as follows:   1. Stopping creates a risk that a vehicle could stall or suffer a mechanical failure while crossing the tracks, with the potential of causing a crash.  2. Stopping can lead to a greater risk of a collision since vehicles are not expected to stop.   3. Stopping for a longer period of time at the crossing increases the risk.   I believe the safest option is to keep pace with other vehicles on the road and simply go past the tracks.
8415	- Presidential candidates may not publicize themselves through monetary means. Candidates must rely on their personal publicity, as well as public debates organized by the White House, to get their message across to the voters. This way, the smaller candidates are not automatically out of the picture.   Additionally, this also prevents outsiders from influencing who gets voted by donating towards a certain candidate.
8416	- Presidential candidates may not publicize themselves through monetary means, but debates hosted online by the White House will ensure that all candidates receive an equal amount of publicity. This way, the smaller candidates are not automatically out of the race.
8417	- Lobbying is prohibited.  This could limit the access of certain interests groups to politicians, thus reducing the possibility of influencing policy decisions.  To compensate for this, the government could provide an equal platform for all candidates to voice their opinions.  This could be through online debates hosted by the government or other such measures.  - Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means. This could reduce the visibility of certain candidates, leading to a less fair election. To compensate for this, the government could provide all candidates with an equal amount of publicity, e.g. through the debates hosted by the government. This allows smaller candidates to have an equal opportunity.
8418	- The US electoral system is designed to ensure that any candidate has an equal chance to be heard and gain support. Candidates may choose to advertise themselves through other means, such as social media and online debates. This ensures that all candidates have access to an audience.  This also means that smaller candidates are not automatically out of the running.  This allows for a larger range of choices for voters.
8419	- Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means. Candidates are allowed to use social media and other online platforms to reach voters, but they cannot pay for ads or otherwise spend money to promote themselves.
8420	I am a 19 year old male who is currently enrolled in college. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, they are not something I have experienced yet. I am not dating anyone, nor have I ever been on a date. While I know that they would likely turn me down, I am not actively looking for a relationship at this point in my life. I am open to the idea of having a relationship, but I do not feel ready for one yet. I am aware that by nature, intimate relationships between two people may not last long.   I am comfortable with my current situation and am exploring other interests such as watching movies, playing video games, browsing the internet, and engaging in activities that interest me. I am open to new experiences, but I have not ventured into any hobbies as of yet.
8421	I am a 19 year old male who is currently enrolled in college. I plan to major in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, I have never had any experience. While I know that women would likely say no if I asked them out, I am not interested in pursuing any relationships at this point in my life. I feel that I am not meant for a healthy, sexual relationship with a woman, especially given my current lifestyle. I am looking for something else to fulfill my life.
8422	I am a 19-year-old male currently enrolled in college, planning to major in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, they are not something I have experienced before, due to my lack of confidence. However, if by some miracle the other person were to say yes, I believe the relationship would be able to last longer than a day. I have some interest in exploring these kinds of relationships in the future. I have some hobbies such as playing video games, browsing the internet and watching movies/TV. I recognize that there are other aspects of life which I should explore aside from genetic passing.
8423	I am a 19 year old male who is currently enrolled in college. I plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, they are currently non-existent. I have never been on a date or kissed a girl. I feel that I am not physically attractive and do not have the best hygiene. I tend to have an odd playlist on my iPod, watch strange videos online, and do not have any hobbies other than playing video games and watching movies/TV. I believe that a person such as me may not find a healthy relationship with a woman anytime soon.
8424	I am a 19-year-old male currently enrolled in college. I plan to major in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. With regards to intimate relationships, I have not had any prior experience. While I know that a female may say no, I am not pursuing intimate relationships at this point in my life due to the belief that it may not last long. I consider myself to be an odd duck since I have different tastes in music, videos, and movies, as well as having limited hobbies such as playing video games and browsing the internet. Despite this, I am searching for meaning and purpose in my life.
8425	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. However, The Lion King stood out among these films as it introduced more unique characters and plotlines than the others, which made it more memorable. Even so, the movie was still quite predictable and did not have any more special elements than the other films in the series.
8426	The Lion King was a very popular movie, but it was not a innovative as Disney had done with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. While it did have some memorable songs and characters, it was largely predictable and clichéd.
8427	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The Lion King represented a natural progression in this improvement, giving a more mature story and more dynamic characters that stood out from their earlier films. Even though it was certainly not unique in its story, it marked a real step up for Disney.
8428	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. However, Lion King did not bring anything particularly new or special to the table; it was quite predictable and cliché. The characters and songs were not anything more special than any other Disney movie.
8429	The Lion King provided a much-needed boost to Disney's animated films after the fairly dull and flat films of the past, such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. While it was certainly more engaging than those films, the Lion King was still fairly predictable and lacked anything particularly special in terms of characters and songs. It did not stand out from the other Disney movies in that period.
8430	A right to privacy is important for lottery winners in order to maintain their sense of security and wellbeing. While people have the right to know the winners of large jackpots, it is possible that winners could choose to remain anonymous if they so choose, in order to prevent unwanted attention from the public. Ultimately, it is the winners’ decision whether or not to share their winning information with the public.
8431	A right to privacy is important for lottery winners, who may face increased scrutiny and potential security risks if their winnings are made public. While some states require the lottery to maintain records of winnings, it is the winner's choice whether these records are made public.
8432	A person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings should be respected. Although there is a risk that people may doubt the legitimacy of lottery winnings, it is important to keep in mind that the money from large jackpots is not necessarily static. Additionally, we do not doubt the validity of other large jackpots in the same manner as lottery winnings.  It is possible that lottery winners take their winnings in a lump sum rather than an annuity, which could also lead to suspicion. Finally, people are more willing to buy lottery tickets without the rigorous identification laws in place.
8433	A person's right to privacy should be considered when it comes to lottery winners; winners should be able to choose whether or not they want the public to know their winnings. While there is a risk that people may believe the jackpots are rigged, it is possible that this could lead to situations where the public believes that jackpots are rigged. However, the fact that lottery employees have access to the money could lead to suspicion and possibly lawsuits. It is also possible that such lawsuits could happen in other large jackpots as well. Ultimately, lottery winners should be aware of the risks and be given the chance to decide if they want the public to know.
8434	A person's right to privacy should be respected, and while transparency is important to ensure trust in the lottery system, lottery winners should have the right to decide if they want the public to know about their winnings.
8435	I work in downtown LA, and the homelessness problem is quite serious here. This morning, a man threw his feces in front of our building; these types of incidents are becoming more common at the food court where I go, as well as on the subways. The problem is especially pervasive in LA, due to the lack of subways with turnstiles and the fact that the system relies on the honor system.   I believe that for cities to develop more quickly, the homelessness issue must be addressed. Additionally, it is important to ensure that those in need receive the necessary treatment for their mental health or addiction issues, in order to create cleaner and safer downtown areas. I believe that providing this type of care could make a significant difference.
8436	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is a significant issue. Last week, I noticed that there was a man who had urinated outside our building. At the food court I frequent, homeless individuals often walk around and ask for money, which can be a nuisance for all users. Furthermore, due to the lack of turnstiles on the LA subways, some homeless individuals have taken to sleeping there, which poses safety and hygiene risks for everyone.   It is clear that, in order for the region to develop, we need to address the homeless issue. While some cities provide treatment for mental illness or substance abuse, LA does not have such programs in place. To me, this hinders the local economy and should be addressed.   I believe that the homeless should be relocated to shelters, where their mental health and addiction issues can be addressed. This would make the downtown area cleaner and safer, while providing the necessary treatment that the individuals need.
8437	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is a concern. I've noticed that some homeless individuals have begun to congregate near the food court where I eat lunch, often begging for change and sleeping on the LA trains which do not have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. This poses an issue for everyone as the homeless population increases. It can also be detrimental to the local economy if these issues are not addressed.   I believe that the homeless should be offered treatment for their mental health or addiction issues, either through camps or clinical settings. This could help both the individuals and the local economy by increasing safety and improving conditions in downtown LA.
8438	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his needles in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system.   This poses a nuisance for everyone and impacts the local economy's growth. I think for any major city to develop faster, we need to find solutions to address the homeless problem.   I think homeless people should be treated for their mental health or addiction problems. They should also be offered camps and other forms of assistance to give them the help they need. This would create a cleaner and safer environment, allowing the city to develop further.
8439	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is a concern. There was a guy who threw his items in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless men sometimes walk around and ask for money. They also sleep on the LA subways due to the fact that our subway system does not have turnstiles and relies on the honor system.   This poses a nuisance to everyone. Many of them appear to have mental illness.   I believe that for any city to develop faster, the homeless issue needs to be addressed. Rounding up the homeless and putting them into camps, as well as providing them with the necessary treatment, is essential to doing so. This approach would provide a cleaner and safer environment, while also allowing the homeless to get the treatment they need.
8440	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday, I received an email from the airline offering a full refund until July 24th or allowing me to change my bookings to a later date. I now have doubts about the airline's safety record, even though the cause of MH17's crash remains unsolved. In addition, the Malaysian stock market has seen overall growth of 80% over the past five years, while the Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. I am considering taking the airline up on their offer of a refund.
8441	Given the recent tragedies involving Malaysian Airlines and the ensuing media attention, I am understandably hesitant about booking with the airline, particularly due to the unresolved fate of flight MH370. Therefore, I am grateful for the offer of a refund, which I am now considering taking up. As the Malaysian stock market has experienced a decrease in growth of 80% over the past five years, and the airline's stock price has dropped by the same figure, I am further persuaded by the offer of a refund.
8442	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) shortly before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or allowing me to change my bookings to a later date. I am now hesitant to book with Malaysia Airlines due to the tragedy, despite there being nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and consumer confidence is weak, as evidenced by a 80% rise in Malaysian stock market over the last five years, while Malaysian Airlines stock price has declined by the same figure. I am considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.
8443	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I am concerned about the safety record of the airline, especially in light of the latest tragedy, and the unresolved fate of flight MH370. This has affected my confidence in the airline, even though there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the crash. I am considering taking up the offer of a refund.
8444	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday, I received an email from the airline offering a full refund up until July 24th, or the option to change my booking to a later date. The MH370 incident and its unresolved mystery has made me uneasy about flying with Malaysian Airlines. Considering this, I am inclined to take the airline's offer of a refund.
8445	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be so revolutionary. While the setting is interesting, I'm not as excited as I could be. The gameplay mechanics seem fairly standard, with a focus on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary?
8446	I can see where you're coming from - Bungie's game does look similar to Borderlands, with a focus on co-op play and loot. I understand this may not be your preferred genre, but it does offer a unique setting and story that could make it a more engaging experience than Borderlands. I also understand your disappointment about the lack of space combat and flightability of the ships; this could be a factor in making the game less exciting for some players. To be honest, I think the game has a lot of potential and could still be very enjoyable. I hope this gives you a better perspective on the game.
8447	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, and offers players the ability to choose from a variety of classes and experience co-operative play with friends. The game world is open-ended, offering players the ability to explore the solar system in their own spaceship. While I understand that this may be a disappointment for some, it has the potential to offer an interesting and unique gameplay experience. I believe this game has the potential to be truly revolutionary and I am interested to see how the gameplay and story develops.
8448	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, and I can see its potential to be a very enjoyable game. However, I think it will be interesting to play, but I'm not as excited about it as some of the hype suggests. It does have the potential to be revolutionary, but for me it needs more depth to be a game I'm truly enthusiastic about. I understand the setting is a draw for some, but for me it's not quite enough to generate the level of excitement I've seen for the game.
8449	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be so revolutionary. The setting does look good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the fact that the ships are not flyable and there is no space combat is a disappointment for me. It does seem to have a nice focus on classes and co-op, but I'm not as excited about it as some people seem to be.
8450	I believe it is important to preserve and celebrate one's cultural identity. However, I have come to understand that defining oneself by a single or multiple nationalities can be limiting. It can prevent us from embracing and celebrating our differences and creating a diverse, open-minded culture.
8451	I believe that everyone has the right to maintain and celebrate their cultural identity, however, it is important to recognize that our identities are constantly evolving. I have seen that when individuals move to a new country, they tend to become more accepting of different cultures, religions and beliefs, which can lead to a sense of openness and growth in their cultural identity.
8452	I am Canadian by birth, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. While some people may feel the need to hold onto their cultural identity, I believe that our cultural and national identity can evolve and develop over time. As humans, we have the ability to develop our own cultural identity, even if we move away from our home country. This allows us to explore different aspects of our culture and make it our own, without feeling that we are losing our identity.
8453	I believe that it is important to maintain ties to one’s culture, but that does not necessarily have to be done through one’s nationality or ethnicity. Everyone is shaped by their environment and background and it is beneficial to be open to new cultures and experiences, rather than to simply define oneself by one’s nationality or nationalities. While it is important to honor and celebrate one’s cultural identity, it is also important to allow oneself to grow and evolve as a person.
8454	I think it is important to embrace our identity and culture, regardless of whether we define ourselves by a single or multiple nationalities. Although this may lead to some initial prejudice and a stagnation of our own cultural and personal development, I believe that accepting our differences and understanding that our identity is constantly evolving can help us move forward without fear.
8455	I believe that children owe their parents a great deal, as the parents gave them life, nurturing and shelter during their childhood, allowing them to remain healthy. Children should stay close to their parents for as long as possible, so that if the parents ever need help, the children can drop what they are doing and assist them, as children are not able to fully comprehend their situation. I believe parents always know better than their children.
8456	I believe that children owe their parents a great deal, as the parents were responsible for bringing them into the world, feeding and sheltering them, and ensuring their relative health during childhood. I also believe that children should remain close to their parents for as long as possible, so that if parents need any help, the children can drop what they are doing and assist them, as children are unable to know what their own futures hold compared to their parents.
8457	I think kids owe their parents a great deal, as their parents provided them with life and care during their childhood. This gives the children the opportunity to stay close to home, in order to help the parents if needed, as the children owe their lives to their parents. I believe that children have limited knowledge and awareness compared to their parents, as the children do not fully understand their circumstances or situations.
8458	I believe that children owe their parents a great debt; the parents brought them into the world and provided them with a home, food and care during their formative years. Ideally, children should remain close to their parents for most of their lives, so that if a parent needs help, the children can drop what they are doing to assist them. I believe that children do not fully appreciate the sacrifices their parents make for them until later in life.
8459	I believe that children owe their parents a great deal, as their parents brought them into this world and provided them with a safe, nurturing environment while growing up. While it is understandable for children to pursue their own lives, it is important for them to be there for their parents if necessary, as they owe their lives to their parents.  I believe that children have no way of knowing what the future holds, and parents always have a greater understanding of the situation.
8460	Men and women both face various obstacles when it comes to dating and finding a relationship. There are cultural and societal norms that affect men and women differently, such as the idea that it is often the woman who approaches the man first. However, despite this, many men and women do not get a chance to explore their romantic interests due to barriers like this.
8461	Men and women both face challenges when it comes to dating and romance. While some couples may take advantage of online dating services or apps to increase their chances of finding a suitable partner, many still prefer to meet in person and take the initiative themselves. This can be more difficult for some individuals due to social norms or other factors.
8462	Men and women both face various challenges in dating and relationships. Although women often have more agency in pursuing romantic interests, gender roles and societal norms can make it difficult for men to approach women, especially in certain contexts. There is a lack of equality in terms of dating and relationships, which can be attributed to both gender roles and social norms.
8463	Men and women both face many challenges when it comes to dating and forming relationships. It is difficult for both sexes to muster the courage to make a move, as societal norms and expectations can be a factor. This can be a challenge for both men and women, as it requires the courage to take the initiative and make the first move.
8464	Men and women often face different challenges when it comes to dating and forming relationships. Although women may have more agency in these matters, it is still true that social norms can lead to men being less pursued than women. This can lead to a lack of opportunity for some men.
8465	I think the Chinese have become stronger in their economy and military, and I'm sure their generals are keen for revenge for the atrocities committed by Japan in WWII. Japan has been protected by American forces, but how much can Japan trust the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter) I think it could happen, and in a tight spot, they may choose to abandon those allies.
8466	I think Japan needs to better protect itself against China.  While Japan has the backing of American forces, it is difficult to trust the US fully, given the possibility of the US not getting involved in a conflict. This could lead to Japan being left vulnerable in a crisis.
8467	I believe that Japan needs to strengthen its defenses in light of China's growing power. China has become more powerful economically and militarily, and its leaders may be seeking revenge for the atrocities committed by Japan during World War II. Japan is dependent on US protection, but can it trust America completely? Would the US go to war with China to defend Japan or South Korea? I don't think it will come to war, but the US may choose to abandon its allies in a tight situation.
8468	The Chinese military is becoming stronger, which is a cause for concern. While Japan was able to recover economically, its military capabilities are weaker compared to China. Although the U.S. provides a security umbrella to Japan, it is impossible to know for certain if the U.S. will act if a conflict were to arise between China and Japan.
8469	I believe Japan needs to take stronger measures to defend itself from China's growing strength. China is becoming more powerful both economically and militarily, and it is likely that Chinese generals are itching for revenge for the atrocities committed by Japan during WW2. Moreover, Japan is reluctant to acknowledge the genocide in the same way Germany does with the Holocaust, which only adds insult to injury.   Japan is protected by American forces, but how reliable is this protection? South Korea is also a US ally, and I believe the US will not get directly involved in a conflict between China and Japan/South Korea, and may choose to abandon its allies in a tight spot.
8470	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Other factors, such as socioeconomic status and educational resources, should be taken into consideration as well. Skin color should not be the sole deciding factor when determining scholarship awards.
8471	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Other factors, such as socio-economic status, should be taken into consideration when determining scholarships to ensure that qualified students have access to educational opportunities.
8472	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a chance to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a student, but given at birth. Affirmative Action should strive to provide an equal opportunity for all students regardless of their background. While targeting access to students of color is laudable, this should not be done by taking away opportunities from more qualified students of other backgrounds.
8473	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a chance to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-determined trait determine the scholarship a student receives?   I believe that all scholarships should be based on merit, and while many are, some schools may be tempted to fill “race quotas” to “diversify the campus” in the process, thus ignoring more qualified students of all colors. This could damage the school’s ability to provide opportunities for all students in the long run.
8474	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Other factors, such as financial need and academic performance, should be taken into consideration to provide equal opportunities to all students.
8475	I understand that the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs, but unions typically give a smaller amount compared to corporations. I think this could be a helpful check on corporate power, as the ability to fund pro-union politicians could provide a measure of democratic oversight. Similarly, when politicians try to limit my right to assemble and air grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their worker organizations.
8476	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that unions, such as the Teamsters and other unions, provide a relatively small amount of money compared to corporations. I believe this is an effective check on the power of capital, which worries me given politicians' ability to limit my right to assemble and air my grievances.
8477	I understand that the Democratic Party receives more money from PACs than unions, which is true of unions overall. I think this system allows corporations too much influence, and the ability for unions to fund politicians could be a positive check on this power. When politicians seek to limit my right to assemble and air grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to worker organizations.
8478	I understand the Democratic Party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that unions provide a smaller amount of money compared to corporations. I believe that this is a useful democratic check on the power of capital. When politicians try to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
8479	I understand the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs. Unions provide a smaller amount of money compared to corporations, which I think is a problem as it limits unions' ability to influence politics. It is important to have a way for unions to fund political candidates, in order to provide a check on the power of corporations, as well as to protect workers' right to assemble and voice their grievances.
8480	I think it's important to respect the views of the founding fathers, but we must not give them more weight than necessary. As individuals, the founding fathers were not infallible and we must look at an issue with a more modern perspective. Political scientists should use their expertise to find the best solution to an issue, not simply interpret what the founding fathers would have done.
8481	I believe that while we should respect the opinions of the Founding Fathers, we should not give them automatic precedence just because of their role. Political scientists should consider what would be the best solution to an issue, rather than merely interpreting what the Founding Fathers would have done.
8482	I believe that although we should respect the views of the Founding Fathers, their opinions do not necessarily represent the best solution to an issue. Political scientists should focus on what would be the best solution, rather than interpret what the Founding Fathers would have done.
8483	I believe it is important to consider the views of the founding fathers, but we should not necessarily take them as the ultimate authority. We must weigh various opinions, including those of the founding fathers, to determine the best course of action. While I believe the founding fathers are worth respecting for their expertise, their opinions should not be elevated above other views.
8484	I believe the founding fathers can provide valuable insight into decision making, but it is important to consider modern contexts and not to simply defer to the founding fathers' views. We must use our own analytical skills to make sure we pick the best option.
8485	I understand the benefits of abortion to society, and while I recognize that it may sometimes be necessary to protect the fetus, I don't believe that abortion should be legal or accessible in all cases. It is a personal issue for me, and while I recognize that abortion can be beneficial to society, I cannot reach a position of acceptance.
8486	I understand the benefits of abortion to society, but I am uncomfortable with allowing abortion in all cases, as I cannot agree that society has an obligation to protect a fetus when there is no informed decision made by the fetus. Additionally, I am reluctant to make abortion legally accessible, due to my moral objections.
8487	I acknowledge the societal benefits of abortion, but I am personally unable to justify it simply because the net gain is positive. I believe that, as it is not possible to make an informed decision, we have an obligation to protect the fetus.
8488	I understand the benefits of legal abortion for society, but I am hesitant to make it legal simply because the net gain is positive. I believe that as a society, we have an obligation to protect life, even if the fetus is unable to make an informed decision.
8489	I understand the benefits of abortion for society, but I am hesitant to legalize it due to moral issues. While I recognize that the fetus cannot make an informed decision, I believe that we have an obligation to protect it and ensure that abortion is accessible.
8490	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat is not healthy, but Curvy women may have more volume in certain areas due to their natural shape, while still maintaining a healthy weight. I feel that it is more appropriate to call women curvy than fat as a more respectful alternative.
8491	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people can have naturally. Thinness is not a healthy weight for everyone; some people need more fat and muscle to be healthy. Curvy women can be heavier than skinny people, but they also aren’t an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is appropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to thin, as it is a better description of their figures.
8492	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. I understand that some people may have a higher percentage of body fat to be healthy, but I believe this is more common for women than men due to their physiology. Curvy women have more body fat than skinny women, but are not an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat as they are two different things.
8493	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people can have naturally. I believe fat is a more appropriate term to refer to higher levels of body fat as it can lead to health issues. While curvy women may not fit into the ‘skinny’ category, they also may not be an unhealthy weight. I feel it is unfair and misleading to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat.
8494	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said I have nothing against someone being overweight. Curvy does not imply a certain weight or BMI as fat does, so it is unfair to call curvy a nicer alternative to fat. I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat.
8495	Creationists argue that evolution is incorrect and that creationism is the correct explanation, based on the fossil record. However, the fossil record indicates that the clams were deposited below the land sloths, which is impossible if all organisms lived at the same time. This indicates that a global flood could not have occurred, indicating instead that evolution's timeframe is more accurate.
8496	Evolutionary science suggests that ancient clams were deposited below giant land sloths before the clams were eventually outlived by organisms that thrive in water, suggesting an age progression. This contradicts a global water flood event proposed by creationists, indicating instead that evolution's timeline is more accurate.
8497	Creationists argue that evolution is wrong and that creationism is correct. The fossil record shows that ancient clams are found in layers below giant land sloths, which existed at the same time. However, this raises the question of how a fast-moving land sloth, which was able to outlive an organism that thrived in water, during a global flood. It seems to me that this timeline is unlikely, indicating that evolution is likely correct.
8498	Creationists argue that evolution is wrong and that creationism is the correct explanation. However, the fossil record suggests that certain organisms evolved before others, with giant land sloths appearing first and clams existing in layers below them. This suggests that the two could not have co-existed, which casts doubt on a global flood occurring and makes evolution's timeline more accurate.
8499	Creationists often argue that evolution is incorrect and that creationism is the correct belief. This is challenged by the fossil record, which shows that clams are found in layers below giant land sloths. This indicates that the organisms could not have lived at the same time, as the sloths would have been unable to outlast the clams due to the water flood. This suggests that the evolutionary timeline is correct.
8500	Reality television can be problematic as it is often scripted and edited for entertainment, which can distort what is reality. This type of programming can influence children in a negative manner, as it portrays unrealistic views of relationships and gender roles. This could lead to unhealthy expectations and beliefs among the youth.
8501	Reality TV shows can be entertaining, but they are scripted and can be inaccurate representations of reality. Programs like The Bachelor can have negative influences on young teenage girls, as they believe they must compete with numerous women to receive a man's attention and have a fairy tale wedding, which is not realistic. Reality shows can also demean women in some cases, which our children may witness.
8502	Reality TV can be entertaining, but it is largely scripted and may not represent real life accurately. While it may be interesting viewing, it can influence young viewers in a negative way, as some shows feature highly-competitive situations to find a partner, or glamorize certain lifestyles. Additionally, some shows may devalue women, which our children may be exposed to.
8503	Reality TV has its pros and cons. On one hand, it can be entertaining and provide viewers with an interesting narrative. However, it is largely scripted and may not be an accurate representation of reality. It can also have a negative influence on children, as some shows teach young viewers to think they need to be beautiful and compete with many other women to get a man's attention, which is not reality.
8504	Reality television can be entertaining but it is heavily scripted and may not accurately portray reality. Some shows can have an influence on children, especially when it comes to dating and marriage programs, which may not accurately reflect reality. In addition, some of these programs may demean women by portraying them in a certain way.
8505	I'm curious about the progress of this project and would welcome more information. I am aware of the Asus EEE laptop, which cost around $300 USD, but I believe that laptops can be manufactured for less than $100. Access to information infrastructure is an important part of nation-building, but Microsoft PowerPoint is not the only option for providing access to the internet.
8506	I'm aware that there has been progress in creating low-cost laptops. I was traveling with an Asus EEE laptop which cost roughly $300 USD. I believe access to information infrastructure is essential for nation-building, but Microsoft PowerPoint is not. (This could be a whole new debate topic!) Will these laptops have access to the internet?
8507	I'm aware that there are still questions regarding the availability of laptop computers that provide adequate features at a lower cost. I believe that with sufficient innovation, a laptop computer can be manufactured for under $100, which is a more reasonable price.   Furthermore, laptop computers should provide access to the internet, as it is an essential part of access to information infrastructure.
8508	I'm aware that the status of these laptop projects vary greatly depending on the region and funding available. I understand that laptop computers can be manufactured for less than $100, although this is dependent on the region and the specifications of the laptop.  In terms of access to internet infrastructure, I believe this is an essential part of nation-building, and laptops should have access to the internet.
8509	I'm aware that laptop computers can be made available for less than $100, as I have personally seen this with the Asus EEE, which cost approximately $300 USD when travelling. I am also of the belief that access to information infrastructure is essential for nation-building, though this is a different debate entirely. Will these laptops have access to the internet?
8510	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family my entire life. They have been the most constant presences in my life. More than that, we all share the same blood, even though we may look different and have similar principles and values. I am more connected to my family than to any other creatures on this planet.
8511	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family throughout my life. They have been the most constant presences in my life. Additionally, I share many of the same characteristics and values with my family. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
8512	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family throughout my entire life. They have been the most constant presences in my life. More than that, we all share the same blood, so to speak. We look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family, as they are part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
8513	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family throughout my entire life. They have been the most consistent presences in my life. We all share the same blood and look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creatures on this planet.
8514	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family my entire life. They have been the most consistent presences in my life. More than that, we all share the same blood and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
8515	I am in favour of allowing greater autonomy to local governments, as I believe this can lead to improved policies and services which are more tailored to the needs of the local population. While I recognize that there are benefits to having a central government that oversees policies on a larger scale, I believe this should be accompanied by greater autonomy for local governments as well.
8516	I believe that the vote should be higher than 5.3%, as this could enable the devolved government to have greater control over decisions that affect the area. While 5.3% may be lower than other regions, it provides a degree of local autonomy which is beneficial in the long run.
8517	I agree that 5.3% is too low a threshold for voting, and it may discourage people from voting in certain elections where the margin between parties is small. However, I believe there is value in having a minimum threshold to ensure electoral integrity and make sure that citizens' votes count.
8518	I'm open to the idea of voting in local elections and I believe that 5.3% is too low an allocation for voting in local elections, as this allows communities to have a greater say in local matters.
8519	I believe that the government should strive to increase the minimum vote threshold for independence referendums, as I think 5.3% is too low. However, I believe 5.3% is an appropriate threshold for voting in general elections, as it allows for meaningful representation of the people's choice.
8520	I would say that, for me, having sex with the same person over a long period of time leads to a lower quantity and quality of sex. It becomes more routine, with less experimentation in both positions and a decrease in the level of excitement.
8521	I would say that in terms of sex, it is generally better earlier in relationships before marriage or long-term commitment. After a long time together, the quantity and quality of sex can both decrease, which is somewhat disorienting. However, being with the same partner can make it feel like a routine, with less experimentation and fewer exciting positions.
8522	I would argue that, while it is certainly different than being in a relationship, cohabitation carries many of the same advantages and fulfillment as marriage or a long-term commitment. Physically, sex is usually better at the beginning of a relationship due to increased hormones and excitement. However, after a long period of time together, the quantity and quality of sex can decrease.
8523	I would say that marriage or a long-term relationship tends to diminish the excitement of the first few months, due to familiarity. However, having said that, it does take more effort to keep the sex life exciting, as positions and experimentation decline over time.
8524	I would say that before marriage or living together, the quality and quantity of sex was better. It seemed more exciting to be with someone new and different. Over time, this excitement seemed to fade, and the sex seemed more routine, with less experimentation and less exploration of positions.
8525	Well let's take a look at the facts, shall we?  Known for holding extremist Islamic views? Check.  Shouted Allahu Akbar during his attack? Check.  Ties to extremist Islamic terrorist? Check.  Expressed hatred of infidels? Check.  Frequently went to Jihadi web sites? Check.  The attack clearly had an extremist Islamic terrorist motive. It is important to recognize this and take steps to prevent similar attacks in the future.
8526	It is clear that the attack was motivated by radical Islamist views as the perpetrator had links to extremist groups and actions, as well as a history of weapon possession and violent behaviour. This suggests that the attack was driven by extremist beliefs, which could have been a factor in the attack.
8527	It is clear that the perpetrator had connections to extreme Islamist ideology, which is a factor that can contribute to terrorist attacks. While the motives behind the attack are still uncertain, these facts indicate that the perpetrator held a radical Islamist viewpoint, which could indicate an extremist motive. Furthermore, the perpetrator's actions appeared to be motivated by extremist ideology, which raises the question of whether it was indeed a terrorist attack.
8528	Whilst the attack did have some connections to Islamic extremism, we cannot definitively say that it was a terrorist attack. Furthermore, the individual's online activities were not necessarily indicative of an extremist agenda; it is possible that the individual had merely accessed such sites out of curiosity. We need to be careful not to jump to conclusions as to the motives behind the attack.
8529	While it is clear that the attack had links to extremist Islamic terrorism, it is difficult to definitively determine the attacker's motivations and intentions based on available information. Given the limited information available, it is possible that the attack was driven by other factors as well, such as mental illness or other social issues.
8530	Death is an important part of life, and funerals serve as a reminder that the dead will no longer be what they were to their survivors. It is important to celebrate the life of the deceased and remember them, while also being happy for the experiences and memories that the dead had. It is natural to feel sad at such a loss, but it is possible to celebrate the life of the deceased and find happiness in their legacy.
8531	Death is a part of life and can be an opportunity to celebrate the life of the deceased. A funeral can be a way for survivors to remember the deceased and be happy, rather than mourn their loss. Everyone is entitled to celebrate the life of the deceased and remember them with joy and happiness.
8532	Death can be difficult to experience, particularly for those left behind. However, life continues, and while the person may no longer be part of it, their existence can still be remembered and celebrated. Funerals can be an opportunity to honor the deceased and recognize the importance of their life.
8533	Death is an inevitable part of life, and funerals serve as a reminder that the deceased will no longer be the same to their survivors. While it is understandable to mourn the loss, it is important to celebrate the life and remember the departed.
8534	Death is a part of life and should be celebrated as such. The physical remains of a person serve as a reminder of what they were to their survivors. Funerals serve to remind everyone of the loss, but celebrating the life of the deceased can provide comfort and enable us to remember and be happy.
8535	We are not talking about killing for fun; rather, we believe it is important to provide animals with a decent quality of life, which is why we suggest euthanasia in certain cases. With animals, it is generally not worth putting an animal through such an ordeal, since the impact on its mate and offspring may be more severe compared to humans. Human beings are more complex creatures, which explains why we bear a greater responsibility for our family and the environment around us. Additionally, human offspring depend on their parents for many different things.
8536	We are not arguing against euthanasia for animals in general; rather, we believe that it is better for humans to keep their sick relatives alive, as their psychological and emotional wellbeing is much more complex than that of animals. Humans have more complex needs and rely more on their family and social surroundings than animals do; therefore, humans have a greater responsibility to care for their family and children. Snakes, on the other hand, will eat their eggs if they cannot find food.
8537	We are not talking about killing for fun; instead, we are saying that in the case of animals, it may not be worth putting a sick animal through an ordeal just to save its mate, as humans are much more complex beings with regards to emotional trauma. Humans have a responsibility to their families, as animals do not stay with their young as much as humans do; they also have a responsibility to care for their children in terms of food and education. Snakes will eat their eggs if they cannot find food.
8538	We are not arguing that humans should put animals through an ordeal to save their mates; with humans, the situation is different. As more complex beings, humans bear a responsibility to those around them, especially their children, who rely on their parents for food and education. Snakes, however, will eat their own eggs if they cannot find the food.
8539	We are not arguing that euthanasia of animals should not be done; rather, we are saying that it may not be worthwhile to put an animal through a distressing experience just to allow its mate to cope, particularly for animals that are less complex in their social structures than humans. With humans, the situation is different; in addition, humans bear the responsibility of providing food and education to their children, which can have a long-term impact on their development. Snakes, on the other hand, will eat their own eggs if they cannot find the food.
8540	I'm not sure it is possible to kill something that is already dead. We can only speculate since we have no definite proof. If something were to become undead and rise from the dead, it is possible that our current methods of killing may not be able to entirely eliminate them, as they are already dead in the first place.
8541	I'm not sure it is possible to kill something that is already dead. We may be able to slow down the process of their decomposition, but it is still possible that they could come back to life due to external factors.
8542	I'm not sure we can definitively kill off something that has already died. We may be able to bring the dead back to life, depending on what it is, but it is difficult to say for sure without having more information.
8543	I'm not sure that is possible. While video games and movies are our only sources, it is difficult to say if something can truly come back to life. We may be able to kill these creatures physically, but it remains to be seen if they can truly be killed off, as they are already dead to begin with.
8544	I'm not sure it's possible to kill off something that is already dead. We have only video games and movies to go on, so it is difficult to say for sure. If something were to be able to come back to life, I believe it would be difficult for us to do so as we usually are unable to kill off the dead.
8545	Yes and no. Art can be a positive addition to a community, especially if it is featured in areas where people gather, such as nightclubs and restaurants. If it is done respectfully and helps to create a sense of culture, it can be beneficial.  No, however, if art is defacing public buildings, monuments and other sites that are meant to look a certain way. It is wrong to do so.
8546	Yes and no. Art is art, and that can be positive if it is accessible and part of the culture. If it is in public spaces, such as nightclubs and other places, it can enhance the environment. However, it is wrong to deface public buildings, historical sites, bridges and other landmarks.
8547	Yes and no. Art is art, and that is true. If in the right area — such as a neighborhood or nightclub — it can add to the culture and be seen as a positive thing. However, if it involves defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas, it is wrong. Those places are meant to look nice and official.
8548	Yes and no. Art is art, and that is true. If in the correct area and context - such as a night club or public area - it can be a positive experience. However, if the art is defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges or other beautiful landmarks, it is wrong. These sites are intended to look professional.
8549	Yes and no. Art is art, and that is true. If in the right context, it can be a positive addition to the environment. For example, if it is displayed in a nightclub or other areas where it fits in with the culture, it can be beneficial. However, if it involves defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges, and other attractive places in the city, it is wrong.
8550	Runes were originally symbols with magical properties, and these symbols eventually evolved into a type of writing system. The runic alphabet used today has its own distinct style and structure, and is considered one of the most visually appealing writing systems in use today.
8551	Runes were discovered magically after Odin hung from Yggdrasil, the world tree, for 9 days. During this period, he experienced visions of runes on the ground below him. These symbols originally served as amulets with magical powers, but eventually evolved into a form of writing system. The Iranian writing system of today is aesthetically pleasing and one of the most beautiful modern writing systems.
8552	Runes were originally symbols with magical properties and later they evolved into a kind of writing system, which enabled them to express ideas more efficiently. This writing system eventually evolved into the modern version used in Iran today, which has its own distinct visual style that makes it one of the most attractive modern writing system.
8553	Runes were originally symbols with magical properties, which evolved over time into a kind of writing system. The writing system of Iran, known today, has characters that are aesthetically pleasing and is one of the most beautiful modern writing systems.
8554	Runes were discovered magically after Odin hung from Ygdrasil, the world tree, for 9 days. During this time, he experienced visions of runes on the ground below him. Initially, these symbols were used for their magical properties, but they eventually evolved into a writing system. The Iranian writing system of today is aesthetically pleasing, with characters that stand out among modern writing systems.
8555	Animal testing should be allowed under strict conditions, such as a suitable habitat for the animal, a suitable diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain diseases or malaises. These conditions should not be compromised, but they may be necessary in order to test products such as make-up or perfume. Despite this, animal testing might be the best option available if the disease being tested for could potentially be a cure for cancer, as it is relatively effective and economical.
8556	Animal testing can be useful for certain research, such as for diseases or malaises, if the alternatives are not as effective or as cost-efficient. The animals should be kept in suitable habitats, given a proper diet, and treated humanely. Testing on animals should be allowed when necessary, but it should not be used for products such as make-up or perfume.
8557	Animal testing can be used in certain circumstances as an alternative to other testing methods, such as when there is no viable alternative or when a particular disease or health issue is being studied. The conditions should include adequate housing, diet and treatment, as well as for specific diseases or malaises. Generally, animal testing might be the most effective option, as it is relatively cheap.
8558	Animal testing should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cost-effective and humane. These conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a balanced diet, no cruel treatment, and only for specific diseases or illnesses. It should not be used for products such as make-up or perfume, but if it is a drug that could be a potential cure for cancer, then animal testing may be the most viable option, as it is relatively cost-effective and one of the most effective tests available.
8559	Although animal testing cannot be avoided entirely at this point in time, it should be allowed if there is no viable alternative that is as cost-effective and efficient as animal testing. The strict conditions should include suitable habitats, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain diseases or malaises. Animal testing should not be used for products such as makeup or perfume, but if testing a drug that could be a cure for cancer, animal testing could be the most effective route available.
8560	Yes, everyone's sense of morality is different, which means that there is not necessarily one "right" way to believe. While pro-choicers' views on abortion may differ from those of pro-lifers, this does not necessarily make either side's position invalid. Moreover, it is difficult to say that someone lacks morality, as morality is a subjective concept that depends on each person's beliefs.
8561	Yes, everyone's sense of morality is different, which means that an individual's morality is shaped by their own beliefs and experiences, rather than adhering to a set of universal rules. Thus, it is possible for two people to have different views on an issue even if one believes that their view is the correct one.
8562	Yes, everyone's sense of morality is different, and this can create some debate and disagreement between parties. However, this does not mean that one side is entirely right or wrong; morality is a subjective concept that can vary significantly from person to person.
8563	While everyone's sense of morality is different, pro-choicers' views on abortion are not necessarily invalid simply because pro-lifers disagree. Ultimately, morality is highly subjective and opinions differ significantly, making it difficult to assert that one side is more morally correct than the other.
8564	Yes, everyone's sense of morality is different, and thus it is possible for a pro-choicer to have valid points in an abortion debate even if a pro-lifer believes that the pro-choicer's views are incorrect. However, it is still possible for the pro-lifer to argue that the pro-choicer's views are incorrect from a moral standpoint. Thus, while morality is subjective, the pro-lifer's argument still has some merit.
8565	I think it is better to purchase an item that gives back financially if you were already going to buy it, as opposed to a completely philanthropic option. It is a good idea to have choices that give back in some small way. Ultimately, it could be beneficial for a cause if it was already something you were going to buy.
8566	I believe that it can be beneficial to give consumers the option of buying a product with a social or environmental benefit if they were already going to purchase the product. This gives people the chance to make a difference if they were already going to buy it. While it may not have a massive impact, it is slightly better than nothing.
8567	Yes, purchasing an item that has a positive social impact is better than nothing at all, and I think it is beneficial to have the option of purchasing items that give back to a cause. I believe that this is a positive development that can lead to greater social impact, even if it is only a little better than not having the option.
8568	Isn't buying the item with the donation option better than not buying anything at all? While it may not seem like much, every bit helps with philanthropy, and if it means that more money is going to the cause, that's preferable to nothing at all.
8569	Isn't it better to buy a red iPod that sends even a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple? Yes, if the customer was already going to buy the red iPod, it is better than nothing.
8570	Bad Company is boring due to its large maps and lack of an engaging single-player experience. The vehicle controls could use improvement, making it more difficult to control the vehicles. The maps are too large and it can be difficult to find enemy players in some areas.   COD: MW2 has large maps, which make it difficult to predict what is around the corner. The vehicles are also hard to control, making it more difficult to navigate them. The maps are too vast, making it difficult to find enemy players.   Battlefield offers more intense gameplay because it keeps players on their toes. The maps are too large, making it difficult to get a sense of the environment and the enemies' positions. Weapons are realistic, though some exceptions exist for the AT4.
8571	Bad company can be monotonous at times due to the large maps and lack of enemy contact, which makes it challenging to track the enemy and predict their movements. Likewise, the vehicles are difficult to control which can be frustrating for some players. The maps are also too large and open, which can create an unengaging experience for some.   In comparison, Call of Duty: World at War features a more intenres gameplay experience due to the tighter maps and more intense encounters with the enemy. Furthermore, the enemies are more difficult to predict and the map designs make the games more exciting.  Battlefield offers a more intense experience than Call of Duty: World at War as players must go out of their way to find and engage the enemy. The maps in Battlefield are also larger which can be challenging for some players. However, the gameplay is more engaging as players must use their skills to locate and take down the enemy.   In conclusion, Battlefield offers more intense gameplay due to the larger maps and more difficult encounters with the enemy.
8572	Bad company can be monotonous at times due to its large maps, which make it difficult to find opponents. The controls can also take some getting used to, while the vehicles can feel strange to control. The maps are indeed quite large, which can be off-putting for some players.   In comparison, Call of Duty: Black Ops has smaller maps which make the experience more intenress. However, Battlefield is more intense due to the mystery of where the enemy could be and the need to be alert to threats. Additionally, Battlefield features more realistic weaponry, with the exception of the AT4 which is not a guided munition.   In conclusion, Battlefield provides a more intense experience due to its larger maps and the need to be alert to potential threats.
8573	Bad Company is boring as it is difficult to locate enemies and the control scheme can be awkward. The vehicles can also be hard to control. For some reason, the maps are too large. On COD: Wasteland, this is one of the biggest maps, and players hate it. On MW2, the maps are larger and it can be more intenaging as you wonder what is around the corner or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head. Additionally, you have to get used to the grenades being thrown at you, which adds to the tension. Battlefield is less intense due to the lack of enemy location, and the maps are too large. On MW2, you have to go out of your way to take out enemies. You are given three magazines of ammo, but skills take time to develop. Additionally, the weapons are realistic, except for the AT4 which is not a guided munition.
8574	Battlefield is more intense compared to COD due to its combat situations; you always know where the enemy is but have more freedom in terms of how to approach them. You also have to develop your skills over time, which gives you a greater sense of accomplishment when you finally take them down. The maps in Battlefield are generally smaller and more focused, making the gameplay more enjoyable and rewarding. Weapons in Battlefield are more realistic, with the exception of the AT4 which is not a guided munition.
8575	School uniforms limit our individuality and could potentially make us less noticeable, which could reduce some forms of bullying; however, it would still occur. In addition, school uniforms could still cause us to get made fun of, as it takes away our distinguishing features. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to generate income.
8576	School uniforms can take away a sense of individuality, however, this may be negated as students may not notice each other as much. Also, uniforms could lead to students still being made fun of. Additionally, school uniforms could increase the amount of money the government receives.
8577	School uniforms can take away some of the individuality that makes us unique as students, however, this would be replaced by a sense of anonymity among the student body. This could still lead to issues of bullying due to what students are wearing. Uniforms would not prevent this. I believe that school uniforms are a way for the government to gain more revenue.
8578	School uniforms take away some of the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights over what they are wearing, but that's just how it is as high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, it would reduce the visibility of our clothing and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to make money off of us.
8579	School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different and make us more similar, which could cause problems in some cases. While school uniforms may limit this, it does not stop us from still being made fun of. I think school uniforms are just another way for the government to generate income.
8580	It is disappointing that hotels have started charging for valet parking, which can add significantly to the cost of a trip. While it is understandable that hotels need to make money, these fees can be expensive, especially if they are charged for extended periods.  For example, at Mandalay Bay, parking at the valet is free for the first two hours, but charges are applied after that.  This can be costly for customers who are not aware of the fees before they arrive.  It is encouraging that the fees are waived at other hotels, such as The Venetian, which does not charge for valet parking.
8581	Mandalay Bay recently changed their valet policy, where they charge for valet parking for the first two hours, which can be costly. This has caused an uproar with customers as many other hotels, such as The Venetian and the MGM, do not charge for valet parking. This appears to be a money-making tactic from Mandalay Bay, which has led to customer dissatisfaction. Although there are free valet options available at the mall near Mandalay Bay, this could prove inconvenient for customers.
8582	Horrible valet fees of $16 for the first two hours can be expensive, as the hotel claims people are using parking for airport transport and not tipping due to the costs. This is a problem with many hotels, as the Venetian does not charge for valet parking, while Mandalay Bay charges for valet parking, although the shopping center valet is free. It is understandable that this has caused a lot of backlash.
8583	The Venetian does not charge for Valet parking, which is a great option for guests. However, other hotels in the area, such as Mandalay Bay, have started to charge for Valet parking, which has caused some uproar as it has increased parking costs significantly. This has caused an issue of accessibility for guests, as not all hotels offer parking options that are free of charge. While it is understandable that the hotels are seeking a form of profitability from this, it has led to some backlash.
8584	The fees at Mandalay Bay are higher than other hotels in the area, but tipping is optional and fees vary depending on the length of stay. The Venetian does not charge for valet parking, while Mandalay Bay adds a share-of-the-profit fee to their valet parking service, which may contribute to the higher cost. Other hotels in the area may offer free parking or cheaper rates.
8585	I enjoyed my experience at the restaurant.  The menu is large, but it comes across as more chain-restaurant-like.  My friend had a burger and fries, which I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries.  You get a salad first which I had a caesar salad which was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicy.  My friend seemed to like the garden salad which was mostly lettuce.  The burger was good and the sweet potato fries were good.  The portion sizes are huge, but I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
8586	It was fine for me, overall, although I did not enjoy it as much as the burger.  The salad was very good, with a nice garlicy flavor.  The chicken sandwich was decent, but it was a little bland.  The sweet potato fries were good, but again, this is not something you cannot get at other pubs.    The portion sizes are definitely huge.  However, I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
8587	It was just okay for me - the menu is large, but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like.  My friend had a burger and fries, which I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries.  You get a salad first - I had a Caesar salad, which was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicky.  My friend seemed to like the Garden salad, although it was largely composed of lettuce.  My sandwich was cold upon arrival, which was a bit of a disappointment since it should have been toasted.  I believe it could have been good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland.  The sweet potato fries were tasty, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs.     It is true that the portion sizes are quite large.  Overall, I was quite satisfied, although I don't necessarily base my meal decisions on caloric intake.
8588	It was alright for me, but nothing special. The menu is large but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like. My friend had a burger and fries and I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries. You get a salad first - I had a caesar and my friend had a garden. The caesar salad was the highlight of my meal! It was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicy. My friend seemed to like the garden salad ok but it looked pretty basic to me - mostly lettuce.  My sandwich came out cold, which is not a good start to a toasted sandwich. It might have been pretty good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland. The sweet potato fries were good, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs.    The portions are quite large, but I do not necessarily base my meal decisions on calorie intake.
8589	I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries, which was okay. My friend had a burger, which seemed to be a good burger. The salad was fresh and crisp, and the garden salad was nice. It might have been better if it were hot, but it was still good. The portion sizes are certainly huge, but I don't make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
8590	Last minute find was surprisingly pleasant! The sushi was delicious and fresh, and the service was excellent. The restaurant's proximity to the action in Vegas made it worthwhile for us. It's worth a visit for dinner and a show.
8591	Last minute find was surprisingly enjoyable for our group of 10. The sushi was delicious and fresh, and the service was excellent. The restaurant is conveniently located near the action of Vegas, so it is worth a stop in for dinner and a show. It is definitely worth the cost.
8592	Located within walking distance of some of the best attractions in Las Vegas, SushiSamba offers a delicious selection of sushi and other Japanese dishes, as well as an excellent view of the city skyline. The service was excellent and the food was fresh and tasty. For a convenient and enjoyable dining experience, I would recommend SushiSamba.
8593	Last minute decision to check out Sushi Stop Vegas was a great choice. The sushi was delicious and fresh, the service was excellent, and the restaurant's proximity to the action made it a good option for dinner and a show. Overall, it was worth the cost and I would definitely recommend it.
8594	I was pleasantly surprised by the sushi at SushiSamba. The food was delicious and fresh, the service was great and the restaurant was conveniently located near the action of both Las Vegas and the outdoor entertainment. It was definitely worth a visit for dinner and a show. It was worth the cost.
8595	Down South Blvd, right off the road is a really cool little place called Vietnam Grille. It is a crowded (which shows how good it is) little clean restaurant. Yesterday in Charlotte it was windy and damp and cold-how perfect for Pho! We went at lunch time, and were able to quickly get a seat. Our order was taken in perfect time. We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26, which is the Beef Pho. The Spring Rolls were delicious, with all the sauces brought to the table to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived- a huge bowl filled with a delicious broth, noodles, beef, and all the extras on the side, such as bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos. It was piping hot and delicious. Definitely something to try!
8596	Down South Boulevard is a vibrant area with a great selection of restaurants. Vietnam Grille is one of the gems in the area; it was busy when we visited, which shows its popularity. The restaurant was bustling at lunchtime when we went, and we were seated promptly. The Crispy Spring Rolls were delicious, with the accompanying sauces being brought to our table for us to dip. The Beef Pho was excellent; it was a huge bowl filled with a tasty broth, noodles, beef, and all the garnishes on the side. It was hot and delicious; I will definitely be coming back again and again.
8597	Vietnam Grille is a popular restaurant located on South Boulevard in Charlotte. We visited during lunchtime when it was quite full, but were able to get a table quickly. We ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls, which were delicious, and the #26 Beef Pho. The soup arrived in a huge bowl, which was filled with a delicious broth and noodles, beef, and the various sauces and toppings on the side. It was warm and tasted great. I would definitely go back again.
8598	Down South Boulevard in Charlotte, Virginia Grill is a cozy and clean restaurant. Despite being very busy, we were able to get a seat quickly and our order was taken in perfect time. We ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls, which were delicious; the sauces were served in bowls and I was able to mix them together for a delicious dipping sauce. The Beef Pho was huge and delicious; the broth was full of flavorful ingredients, with noodles, beef, and all the toppings on the side. It was piping hot and a delight to eat. I will definitely be returning in the future.
8599	Down South Blvd, right off the road is a really great restaurant called Vietnam Grille. It was busy, but we were able to find a table quickly. We ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls and the #26, which is the Beef Pho. The Spring Rolls were delicious, and all the sauces were brought to our table to enhance the flavor of the soup. The Soup arrived in a huge bowl, filled with a flavorful broth and noodles, as well as beef, bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapeños. It was hot and delicious; I will definitely be returning.
8600	Our waiter was very polite and attentive, which was the best part of the meal.  It was definitely better than the lasagna I have had in the past, though it may be the worst I have tasted (possibly worse than Chef Boyardi). I would probably not recommend this place to others as there are better options in the area.
8601	Our waiter was fine. Very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal!   The food was okay, however there are much better options in the area.  The lasagna was decent but not great; I have had worse lasagna but maybe Chef Boyardi is worse - maybe.   Overall, I was not impressed. There are much better restaurants in the area.
8602	Our waiter was fine. Very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal!   Sadly, the food was not up to expectations. The lasagna was not the worst I have ever had, but it was far from good; it was truly disappointing.  I would rate it as the worst I have had, perhaps even worse than Chef Boyardi.   I would strongly advise others to steer clear of this restaurant. There are many better places in Las Vegas.   I was very disappointed in the food. The calamari was just ok, and the meatballs were bland.  It was not worth the visit.    I agree with the rating.  Do not eat here.
8603	Our waiter was fine. Very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal!   That was surprising, as we were expecting better food overall. The lasagna was definitely the worst we have ever had (possibly even worse than Chef Boyardi). We may have been slightly more impressed with the meatballs and calamari, but both were just average. We were definitely not impressed with the overall meal.   We were disappointed in the food. There are definitely better places in Las Vegas for Italian dishes.
8604	Our waiter was very polite and attentive, which was the best part of the meal.  Although the lasagna was not the worst I have had, it was disappointing compared to other Italian dishes I have had. I might give Chef Boyardi the edge in terms of taste.  There are definitely better places in Las Vegas for Italian food.  I would advise others to look elsewhere.   ## Apart from the food, the atmosphere and service were pleasant.  I would give the overall experience a 6/10.
8605	I have had a positive experience overall at this sub sandwich place. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is friendly and efficient, which I appreciate. However, I was slightly disappointed once when cheese was added to my order but it was not present in the sandwich. Other than that, I have always had a good experience.
8606	I have had a positive overall experience at this restaurant. The ingredients always taste fresh and the bread is always soft. The service is friendly and quick, which I appreciate. On one occasion, I ordered a sandwich with cheese, but there was no cheese on the sandwich, which was a little disappointing. Other than that, I have always enjoyed my experience.
8607	I have had a positive experience overall at this All-American sub sandwich restaurant. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is always friendly and quick, which I appreciate. However, there have been a couple of times when they have asked if I wanted cheese in my sandwich, and I agreed to the addition, but the cheese was not included on the final product. Other than this occasional issue, I always have a great experience.
8608	I have had a positive experience overall at this sub sandwich restaurant. The ingredients always taste fresh and the bread is always soft. The service is always friendly and they are quick to make the sandwiches. However, I have been slightly disappointed once or twice when cheese has not been included, even though I have asked for it. Other than that, I have always had a good time.
8609	I have enjoyed my experience at this sub sandwich restaurant. The ingredients always taste fresh and the bread is soft. I appreciate the friendly service which always makes the sandwiches quickly. On one occasion, I ordered cheese on my sandwich, but there was no cheese, which was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, I have always had a positive experience.
8610	I had a different experience at Caffe Boa than other reviewers, although I did visit on a Tuesday night. Although the restaurant was fairly empty, when we arrived the hostess seemed overwhelmed at the prospect of seating four more people, leading her to push two tables together. We were never greeted or given a drink, even after we had waited ten minutes. We ultimately chose to leave and go to Z'Tejas, where we had a better experience.
8611	I recently visited Caffe Boa and was surprised by my experience. I had a reservation for four, however when we arrived there was only one other party in the restaurant. The hostess was visibly stressed and told us they could only fit us at one table, which was pushed together in a mostly empty restaurant. We were not greeted and no water was offered. After 10 minutes, we decided to leave and try another restaurant, Z'Tejas. Although I am aware that the atmosphere may be different on a busier night, I felt that our experience could have been better accommodated.
8612	After reading the positive reviews on Caffe Boa, I was disappointed to have a less favorable experience there. When my friends and I arrived at 7:30 pm on a Tuesday, there were only a few other tables occupied. We had called ahead for a reservation for four, but when we arrived with one extra person, the hostess seemed overwhelmed. She pushed two tables together in an almost empty restaurant. We were never greeted, nor offered a water. We waited for about 10 minutes before going to Z’Tejas, which we found to be a better option. I will try again at a busier time, as I believe our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
8613	I was a bit disappointed in my experience at Caffe Boa as I did not taste any of the food. I went with four friends on a Tuesday evening and we had a reservation for four. When we arrived, the hostess gave us a disappointed look as there were very few customers. She said she had to push two tables together, which was empty until then. We were not greeted or offered a water. We gave it a 10 minute grace period before leaving. I am willing to give it another chance on a busier night, when tables may not slip through the cracks as easily.
8614	After reading all of the positive reviews on Caffè Boa, I was disappointed in my experience there. First, I should mention that I did not taste a single morsel of food. I was with four friends, and we decided to go in at around 7:30 PM on a Tuesday. Our friend had made a reservation for four, but when we arrived with an extra person, the hostess gave us a disappointed look, as she had to move two tables together in an almost-empty restaurant. She seated us, but we sat and sat for ten minutes without a single greeting or even a glass of water.    We gave the server/manager/whoever a chance, but our odds of being acknowledged were slimmer. We ended up leaving and going to Z'Tejas, where we had a better experience. I will try again on a busier night, with the hope that the additional diners will increase our chances of being noticed.
8615	Schools should have dress codes as they can help students maintain focus on their work, while also helping to keep order in the school environment. Uniforms can also enable school authorities to set certain restrictions on what students can wear. Although this limits student creativity, uniforms also provide some level of protection against inappropriate clothing items.
8616	Schools should not create dress codes as they can limit students’ creativity and choice. Uniforms can help students focus more on their work and maintain school order, but students are still impressionable and need rules to follow. While dress codes can provide specific rules to prevent wearing certain items.
8617	Schools should create dress codes as they can help to keep students focused on their work and help maintain order in the school environment. Uniforms also provide this benefit, as well as helping to ensure students’ safety. Although students have their own creativity, rules are necessary to prevent inappropriate clothing items from being worn.
8618	Schools should have some form of dress code in place, as uniforms can help students focus more on their work as well as keep order in the school environment. However, uniforms can also limit student creativity, as kids are still impressionable. Therefore, specific rules should be put in place to prevent students from wearing certain items.
8619	Schools should have the right to create dress codes as they believe that uniforms can help students focus more on their work and also help with maintaining order, as children are highly impressionable and rules are necessary to prevent certain items from being worn.
8620	Wearing a school uniform can be beneficial as it will ensure that the students’ bodies are fully covered, preventing any exposure of body parts the school wishes to keep covered. This will also help to alleviate any concerns the students may have about what they are wearing.
8621	Another advantage of school uniforms is that the uniforms will always be decent. They will cover every part of the body that the school deems inappropriate and the students will not be self-conscious about their clothing.
8622	Wearing a school uniform can be beneficial as it ensures that the students are always covered and that the school has control over what parts of the body the students can show. This can help create a sense of unity and camaraderie among the students, while also providing them with a sense of security.

8625	School uniforms may be beneficial for creating a sense of unity and identity within a school community, but beyond that, the uniforms generally serve little purpose once the child is no longer in school, as compared to civil dress which can still be worn outside of school settings.
8626	School uniforms may be costly and time consuming to purchase and maintain if there is no requirement for the student to wear it beyond the school premises, as school dress codes may not serve much purpose once the child is no longer in school.
8627	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms may limit a student's freedom and creativity when attending school, but they can save money in the long run as the student progresses through their education.
8628	While school uniforms may be beneficial in providing a sense of identity and community among students while they are in school, once they leave school, the uniforms become largely unnecessary and a waste of resources.
8629	School uniforms may not have a major impact on a child's academic performance while they are in school, but once the child is no longer in school, the school uniforms become largely unnecessary and wasteful.
8630	There are several reasons why flash drives are limited in terms of storage; one of the primary reasons is the cost of memory, which makes flash storage more expensive than traditional hard disk drives. Additionally, due to their nature as solid-state devices, flash drives have less space for data storage than hard disk drives. This is partially due to the fact that flash drives require more overhead for data encoding and formatting.
8631	There are several reasons why FFIs are limited in their ability to access online learning materials, including restricted bandwidth and less reliable connection. This makes it difficult for learners to access the materials they need.
8632	There are several reasons why the utilization of 5G technology is slower than expected. One of the main reasons is the lack of infrastructure for 5G networks, as most countries have only recently begun to develop these networks. Additionally, the cost of 5G-enabled devices has limited consumer adoption. Furthermore, the relatively low bandwidth of 5G networks when compared to 4G networks is another factor that has limited the usage of 5G.
8633	FFVIEs can limit the number of reasons that are taught in a unit to provide children with a focus and help them better understand the main concepts of each reason.
8634	The number of reasons why FF IEs are limited in their access to online educational materials is because these materials are often not adapted to their needs, making them difficult to understand and access.
8635	One feature that made the product particularly attractive is its tab system, which allows multiple files to be viewed side-by-side. This allows for greater productivity and better workflows. While this feature may seem familiar to some, it was actually introduced in version 7 of the program, ahead of its time in the market.
8636	One feature that proved especially useful was TABS. This enables users to quickly switch between programs, allowing them to easily compare and contrast different applications. This proved to be especially useful when testing multiple browsers.
8637	One feature that ultimately sealed the deal for me was the new tab system in IE 8, which provides a much better way of managing open tabs than the previous version.
8638	One feature that made the difference was TABS, which IE added in version 7.
8639	One feature that proved particularly useful is Task Tabs, which allow users to easily view and manage multiple open tasks at once. This is something that Internet Explorer added in version 7, suggesting that Microsoft has been paying attention to how users work and making changes to its browser accordingly.

8642	I would only turn my partner in if there is strong evidence and witnesses to back up the accusation, and if the authorities are aware of the situation.

8644	I may be willing to turn him in depending on the evidence and witnesses that are available. Ultimately, I would make the decision based on the situation and thelikelihood that the police could convict the crime.
8645	No, I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. However, I do not believe it is my place to go and turn him in. This would depend on the reason behind the murder; I would only turn him in if it was a random killing.
8646	I would first try to convince my spouse to turn himself in. Ultimately, I would make the decision whether or not to turn him in, as it is my decision to make. However, if the crime involved murder, I would be more likely to turn him in, as I would fear for my own safety.

8648	I would try to convince my spouse to turn himself in. It is not my place to go and turn him in, but I would do so if it is a murder or other serious crime. I would be more likely to turn him in in this case, as I would fear for my own safety if I am next in line to be killed.
8649	No, I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. However, I do not believe it is my place to go and turn him in. It depends on the reason behind the killing; I would turn him in for that, as I would think that I would be next to get killed.
8650	It would depend on the details of the situation and how she felt about it. I would need to be able to understand her emotional state and why she made the choice she did in order to truly forgive her. If I could do this, then I may be able to forgive her.
8651	It depends on the details of the situation. I would need to hear her side of the story and understand her reasoning in order to determine whether I can forgive her. If I believe she is truly remorseful and feel that she had a valid reason for committing murder, then I may be able to forgive her and not turn her in.
8652	I would need to hear her side of the story to determine if I can empathize with her and understand why she committed murder. If I believe she is genuinely remorseful, I could forgive her and not report her to the authorities.

8655	Love is more powerful than any mistake. I know things happen, but my wife will always be able to confide in me, no matter what challenges we may face. I made a commitment to stick with her during difficult times, and I will. Murder is an unpardonable mistake, but love is more resilient.
8656	Love is more powerful than any mistake. I know mistakes can happen, but my wife will always be able to confide in me, no matter what challenges we face.

8660	If I hire a housekeeper and cook, it will free up my time to socialize and be more physically active. It may be unpleasant to start a new romantic relationship from scratch, but I am open to the experience. After all, everyone has a different reason for their decision to end their life.
8661	If I hired a housekeeper and a cook, it would take some of the pressure off and give me more time to spend with my partner. Depending on the situation, I might be open to dating again, although it would take time for me to feel comfortable. Again, it depends on the circumstances.
8662	If I hire a housekeeper and a cook, it would take some of the pressure off when it comes to maintaining a household. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to entirely rely on someone else; I'm too old to start the dating scene again. Additionally, you have not specified why she was killed or the circumstances around it. It is possible that she had legitimate reasons for doing so.
8663	If I hire a helper, I will still have to do most of the cooking and cleaning in the house, as well as deal with dating again. Additionally, I may be wary of someone new without knowing why they were killed off. I would need more information to make a judgment.
8664	If I hire a helper, who will do the cooking and cleaning in the house? Who will have sex with me? I'm too old to go through the dating scene all over again. There are many reasons why someone may choose to end their life, but it is important to understand the why behind it. Every life is important and has a purpose.
8665	I would need to consider the situation carefully and weigh the consequences of turning him in. If the incident occurred only once, I might be willing to hide the facts and act as if it never happened in order to protect the person I love, but I would be more inclined to report it if it happened more than once.
8666	I would not turn him in unless the death was intentional. Although I could potentially hide the facts and act as if it were an accident, I believe it is unlikely that this would happen more than once.
8667	I would only report someone if they had killed another person, as there is no way an accident could happen more than once. I believe if I truly loved the person, I could find a way to hide the facts and act as if it never happened.
8668	I would only turn him in if the death was intentional, as I believe that it is difficult to hide the facts of a crime and that the situation is unlikely to occur again if it is not an accident.
8669	I would only turn him in if the crime was serious enough that it could not be accidental, such as murder or rape. I would have a difficult time hiding the facts and pretending it never happened if I truly loved the person.

Books also offer more depth than television, making them more suitable for people who like to delve into the content and explore the stories further.

Books allow us to explore new ideas and escape from our everyday lives, while TV is mainly entertainment that is primarily visual in its delivery.

8690	I believe India is not yet ready to lead the world due to a number of factors.   1.

India's politicians often make small issues into big ones, such as when they comment on each other's actions.
8691	I believe that India is not yet ready to lead the world due to several reasons.  1. India is still dealing with cases of black money, with political figures seeking to gain or earn money illegally.  2. Political figures often inflate issues involving other politicians, which distorts the importance of such matters.
8692	I believe India is not ready to lead the world yet due to a number of reasons.  1. India has seen an increase in cases of black money, which is a concern as Indian politicians strive to gain or earn money in any way possible.  2. India has a tendency to over-emphasize certain issues, such as when a politician says something about another politician, which could divert attention away from more important topics.

Indian politicians are often involved in corruption cases as they seek to gain or earn money for themselves.  2. Indian politicians often try to make a big issue out of useless topics, such as when one politician attacks another.

8695	While China may have an advantage in terms of population size, India has the potential to be a major economic player in the world in the future. India has the potential to grow faster than China in terms of economy and could pose a threat to China's dominance.
8696	China and India have the potential to be major global players in the coming years, as their economies expand rapidly and their populations increase. While China is likely to be a leading economic power, India has a chance to be a influential player as well.
8697	China has the potential to become a dominant global economic power in the future, depending on its ability to successfully develop its economy and build up its infrastructure. India has the potential to develop its economy and could become a major global power as well.

8699	China and the US are likely to remain the two largest economies in the world for the foreseeable future, with India having the potential to overtake China and become the third largest economy by 2030.
8700	Yes, governments have a responsibility to provide basic services to their citizens, including healthcare and education. While some developing countries are starting to catch up in terms of infrastructure and access to resources, there is still a long way to go in order for them to reach developed nation status.
8701	Having access to modern technology and communication can provide tremendous advantages to developing countries in terms of education, health care, and economic development. While there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving full access to these resources, such countries are making progress in this regard and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
8702	Having a strong economy is an important component of national development, however, there are many other factors that contribute to a nation's development, such as infrastructure, education, and health care, which play a larger role in a country's quality of life.
8703	Hahaha really?  This debate is an important one, as some countries are struggling to develop their healthcare systems due to limited resources. It is important to note that there is a great deal of variation in a country’s healthcare system depending on its development level.
8704	I think the idea of universal basic income has potential, however, I believe that the amount proposed is too high and could cause more harm than good. In my opinion, the proposed amount of $1,000 per month may not be sufficient to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living in poverty and may even further push poverty levels in some countries.”

8722	Adrian Peterson? Yes, that's my name. I understand your skepticism, especially since names can be deceiving. My speech may give me away a bit more, but it is still possible for two people to have the same name. I believe I am unique in how I speak and carry myself, which gives me away as the unique individual that I am.
8723	Adrian Peterson? Are you my husband? I have to admit, your name and speech style suggest that you could be my husband, given the recent name change and the similar speech patterns between our children.

8735	We may both have been exposed to different beliefs and ideas since an early age, but each of us have had our own experiences and beliefs reinforced through our upbringing and social environment. Thus, while we may have been exposed to similar ideas, our perspectives have still been shaped by unique experiences.
8736	Growing up, we are exposed to different perspectives and beliefs that can often contradict our own. This can lead to us forming our own opinions and beliefs, which we then base our lives on. While this is natural, it can lead to us being narrow in our views, which could limit our understanding of the world.
8737	Although our educational systems create different perspectives on certain topics, in the end both systems provide an experience that enables us to form opinions and make choices. We may be exposed to different ideas and information, but the underlying principles and values that are instilled in us are similar.
8738	Although our beliefs may differ, it is possible to gain knowledge and experience new things that allow us to form our own opinions. We may be exposed to similar concepts and materials in our upbringing, but each of us is able to make an individual decision as to what we believe.

8760	Although mental illness can impact an individual's ability to make decisions, many states will intervene in such cases to ensure the individual's safety and wellbeing. States will also step in if an individual's mental stability and ability to reason are significantly compromised.
8761	while the state may intervene in cases of mental illness, it is important to consider the potential long-term effects of such illnesses on an individual's ability to make decisions and reason. Thus, it is possible that the mental stability and ability to reason could be compromised in such cases.
8762	The state intervenes in cases of mental illness when it is deemed to be severe enough to warrant such intervention. In some cases, this intervention can involve the forced medication and treatment of the individual, as allowed by law, in order to ensure the individual's mental stability and ability to reason.
8763	Your argument is correct in that states will sometimes intervene in cases of mental illness, but this can depend on the severity of the illness and the individual circumstances. If mental illness is severe enough to significantly impact an individual's mental stability and ability to reason, states may step in.

8765	Legalizing drugs can help save lives in two ways. First, it can reduce the risk of death from illegal drugs, since these are often more dangerous substances that can cause harm or even death if used in high doses. Second, it can also reduce the number of abortions that occur due to an unintended pregnancy, as legalizing drugs may give women more options to control their reproductive rights.
8766	Legalization of drugs can help save lives by reducing the risks associated with accessing drugs such as illegal substances or medications which may be legalized in some jurisdictions. Abortion laws that allow access to safe and legal abortions can save lives by removing the need to take risks to terminate a pregnancy.
8767	Legalizing drugs can help save lives by providing people with more access to treatment and reducing the spread of certain diseases. Likewise, keeping abortion legal can help save lives by providing women with more reproductive options and eliminating the need to illegally abort a child and take a life.
8768	Legalizing drugs can help save lives in several ways. First, it can reduce the risk of death from drug overdoses and other drug-related harms. Additionally, it can increase access to treatment for addiction, which can save lives by enabling people to receive the help they need. Finally, it can provide more control over the quality and safety of drugs, which can also save lives.
8769	Decriminalizing drugs can help save lives by providing individuals with access to controlled substances under safer conditions, reducing the risk of harm from consuming these substances under unregulated conditions. Furthermore, keeping drugs legal can help save lives by making these substances more accessible for consumption, which in turn reduces the need to seek out illegal methods of terminating a pregnancy.
8770	This is the scientific view of evolution. Science is based on evidence and testing theories through experiments, while evolution is largely supported by scientific evidence and is accepted as a theory by the scientific community. Religion has its own views on the world, which can be tied to evolution in some cases, but evolution as a concept is based on science.
8771	This is the view of the evolutionary process that is supported by science. Evolution is a scientific process which is supported by a body of evidence, including fossil records, DNA and genetic evidence, and other sources. This evidence is then used to infer a timeline of events and the related processes which have occurred over time. Religion is not a part of this process, as evolutionary science is based on evidence and reason, not on theology.
8772	This is a common view of the evolutionary argument. Evolution is based on scientific evidence, which includes fossils, biochemical evidence, and homologies. This evidence is analyzed through the scientific method, which involves forming hypotheses and testing them through experiments. Science cannot answer questions related to the origins of life, which are largely theological in nature.
8773	This is a common view of the creationist argument. While evolution is supported by scientific evidence, it is largely based on scientific theory, which differs from scientific fact as it cannot be proven directly. Additionally, evolution is primarily supported by the scientific method, which uses observation and experimentation to draw conclusions, rather than a theological approach.
8774	This is the commonly held view of the evolutionary argument. Evolution is based on scientific evidence, which is gathered through observation and experimentation. This evidence is then used to form theories and explanations about the origin of species. As stated, this is the scientific method.

8844	I believe that television can be more helpful than reading as visual elements can help us understand concepts better. Some people may find it difficult to visualize the process without TV, but we should be mindful of the amount of time spent watching TV. As surveys show, our retention of information is better when we watch or listen compared to reading.
8845	People who are against TV often cite it as a cause of obesity, citing the argument that it is easier to exercise while watching TV than reading a book. In gyms, people are more likely to have televisions instead of books, with studies showing that TV is even more stimulating than books.
8846	Studies have shown that television is even more stimulating than books, making exercise more enjoyable than reading. Gyms now often have television sets instead of books to provide exercise motivation.
8847	Studies have shown that televisions can be even more stimulating than books, as gym-goers are more likely to watch TV rather than read a book due to its increased visual stimulation.
8848	People who are against television often claim that it causes obesity. In gyms, people are more likely to have TVs rather than books to watch, and studies have shown that television can be even more stimulating than books.
8849	Some people argue that television can be a factor in increased obesity due to the sedentary nature of the activity; however, gyms and other exercise locations now often have televisions instead of books, meaning that television can be more stimulating than books, indicating that it is at least as stimulating as reading a book. Studies have suggested that television can be more stimulating than reading a book.
8850	Yes, reading can help relax you if you are tired, as well as provide an opportunity to learn something new. However, commercials can be an issue, as they can be intrusive at times.
8851	Reading can be a great way to relax, as it allows you to escape from your current environment and immerse yourself in a good book. Additionally, reading can help reduce stress and let you take your mind off of things, which can help if you are feeling tired.
8852	Yes, reading can be a great way to relax as it allows the mind to switch off and take a break. Additionally, reading can help to reduce stress, as it allows a person to enter a new world and take their mind off their current thoughts and feelings. In terms of the commercials, this can be bothersome at times, depending on the length and frequency of the commercials.
8853	Yes, reading can help relax you, especially if you are tired. However, you can also just simply relax by reading, which can help reduce stress and tiredness. Adverts on streaming services can be quite intrusive at times, so it is something to consider.
8854	Yes, I think it can help to relax you if you're tired, as well as reading. Advertisements can be a nuisance, yes, but they do help generate income for publishers.
8855	Historically, marriage has evolved as a way to reinforce social bonds and provide structure and stability to families, as well as to meet legal and religious requirements. To change the parameters of marriage to allow for same-sex unions goes against these important social and cultural foundations.
8856	Marriage has traditionally been viewed as a union which brings stability and shared commitment between partners, as well as recognition and acceptance from the wider community. This is primarily due to its importance from a moral and religious standpoint, rather than simply being approved by the state. This is to ensure that couples have stable foundations to build upon. Similarly, granting certain rights to same-sex couples can provide them with additional stability and security, as well as offering them the same recognition and acceptance from the state.
8857	Marriage has traditionally been seen as a bond between two people, as a way of formalizing a relationship and providing legal recognition and protection, as well as social recognition and acceptance. While some governments may choose to extend this right to gay couples, doing so could limit the meaning and significance of marriage and thus reduce its overall value.
8858	The legal recognition of marriage has its roots in both moral and religious considerations, providing a framework to provide stability and security for couples. Having a recognized legal status for couples can provide a sense of security and stability, which is beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole.
8859	Marriage has historically been recognized by societies as a way to reinforce stable relationships between partners, as well as to provide legal and social protection, which is beneficial to both individuals and wider communities. It is therefore understandable that governments would want to offer such protections to all couples. This emphasizes the value of marriage as a legal and social institution rather than simply recognizing it as an option.

8869	Going to church is an important part of Christian faith and practice for many people, providing an opportunity to connect with the spiritual and to develop relationships with others in the faith community.
8870	I find most religions to be meaningful and useful for many people, however I personally feel that atheism best reflects my beliefs. I feel that atheism offers more logic in my mind than other belief systems.
8871	I personally believe that most religions provide a helpful framework for understanding the world and our place in it, though this is not the case for all individuals. There are some people who are strongly drawn to religion due to their upbringing, while others are more open to exploring different beliefs. I prefer the viewpoint of atheism as it allows for more logical reasoning in my mind.
8872	I understand why some people are drawn to religion, as it can provide a sense of comfort and belonging, but I personally prefer an atheist viewpoint as it offers more logical reasoning in my opinion.
8873	I personally believe that most religions contain valuable insights and can be helpful in providing people with a sense of purpose and community, however, I am more inclined to define my beliefs as a non-theism.
8874	I'm open to various belief systems, but I'm more drawn to atheism than other beliefs. I feel that atheism offers more logical reasoning in terms of my beliefs.
8875	Throughout most of history, people have believed in some kind of higher power or spiritual force that lies beyond the physical world. Although no definitive evidence exists for these beliefs, they have been largely accepted for centuries.
8876	Throughout most of history, many cultures have believed in some sort of higher power or spirits that exist in the sky. While there is no conclusive evidence of these beliefs, they have been prevalent in many societies for centuries.
8877	Through much of human history, people have believed in some type of spirit existence in the sky, although evidence for this belief is scarce in most cases.
8878	Through much of human history, people have believed in some type of spiritual or supernatural presence in the sky. Although no direct evidence exists of this, this belief has been around for many centuries.
8879	Throughout much of human history, people have believed in a spiritual realm that exists beyond what we can see, although evidence for this belief is sometimes limited.
8880	I think physical discipline can be an effective way of communicating boundaries and teaching children lessons. If a child has done something seriously wrong, such as causing an accident or stealing, corporal punishment could be an appropriate response in order to make them understand the consequences of their actions.
8881	I believe it is important to discipline children and set boundaries to teach them the consequences of their actions. I would consider physically disciplining them if they commit serious wrongs, such as crashing a car or stealing, in order to make them understand the severity of their actions.
8882	I think it is important to set boundaries and consequences for bad behavior to ensure that children learn the consequences of their actions. Spanking or physically disciplining your children can be an effective way to send this message, provided that the severity of the action is taken into account.
8883	I think it is important to discipline your children in order to instill understanding of the consequences of their actions. I believe a parental timeout can be effective in teaching children that their actions have consequences and that they should avoid repeating those actions.
8884	I believe that corporal punishment can be an effective form of discipline under certain circumstances. While I do believe that it is important to set boundaries and provide consequences for misbehavior, I also believe that it is essential to set limits and make sure that children understand the consequences of their actions.
8885	Yes, if they fear getting hit, they are less likely to repeat the behavior in the future.
8886	Yes, this could discourage a child from participating in activities that could cause them harm, as they may be hesitant to repeat an experience that they perceive as dangerous.
8887	Yes, this could be a factor as it may reduce the risk of injury if the individual takes steps to avoid contact, which could reduce their willingness to participate in the activity in the future.
8888	Yes, this can help prevent further incidents as the fear of being hit could deter them from engaging in similar behaviour in the future.
8889	Yes, this could prevent them from further engaging in risky behaviour as they may be hesitant to repeat the activity if they fear possible repercussions.
8890	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline when necessary. If the child does not follow the appropriate behavior after being warned a few times, then a spanking could be an option.
8891	Parents should use corporal punishment as an option of last resort, only when other forms of discipline have not been effective. If the child does not conform to appropriate behavior after several warnings, then this could be the basis for a spanking.
8892	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline children if needed. If the child does not follow the proper behavior after being warned multiple times, spanking could be an option.
8893	Parents should use corporal punishment as an option of last resort when needed to discipline a child. If the child does not follow the expected behavior after several warnings, then it is appropriate to use corporal punishment as a form of discipline.
8894	Parents should consider spanking as an option for discipline when it is necessary. If the child does not follow the correct behavior after being warned several times, then a spanking may be appropriate.
8895	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, as it can help teach a child the difference between right and wrong in the long run. Each child responds differently to different forms of punishment; one approach might involve simply telling the child "no" or grounding them, whereas another might require a spanking to ensure proper learning of right and wrong.
8896	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline in certain cases, as it can help to reinforce lessons in the long run. Each child responds differently to different punishments, and some may require more direct forms of correction, such as a verbal warning or grounding, while others may require a physical reprimand.
8897	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, as it can help teach children the right ways and reinforce concepts over time. Each child responds differently to different types of punishment, and one approach may work better than another for teaching them right and wrong.
8898	I believe spanking can be an effective form of punishment if it is used to teach a child in the long run; each child responds differently to different forms of discipline. While one approach of simply telling a child 'no' or grounding them may work on another, it may take a spanking to teach them the difference between right and wrong.
8899	I believe spanking can be an effective form of punishment if it is used to teach a child in the long run. Each child responds differently to different disciplinary actions; some parents may choose to tell a child no or ground them, while other children may require a spanking to learn the difference between right and wrong.
8900	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline when other methods have not been successful.
8901	I believe spanking can be an effective form of punishment in certain situations, however, other forms of discipline should be used in conjunction if possible.
8902	I believe spanking can be an effective form of punishment if other disciplinary measures have not been successful.
8903	I believe that spanking could be an effective form of punishment if other disciplinary measures have not been successful.
8904	I believe spanking could be an effective punishment if other forms of discipline have not worked.
8905	I support the use of corporal punishment as a form of discipline, as I believe it can be effective in instilling fear and avoiding repeating an offence in order to ensure that a child does not repeat their behaviour.
8906	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline, as it can help a child associate the consequence of their actions with a feeling of fear that discourages them from repeating it in the future.
8907	I support this because spanking can be an effective form of discipline in certain situations, as it can instill a fear of repeating the behavior in the child that helps ensure that it does not occur again.
8908	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, as it can help a child understand that certain behaviors are unacceptable and discourage them from repeating those behaviors. However, it is important to ensure that the child is not psychologically harmed by the experience.
8909	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline, as it can help to instill a fear of repeating the behavior in the future. This can be beneficial in creating long-term negative consequences for the child, as it can help to ensure that the child is less likely to repeat the behavior in the future.
8910	Atheism has existed for centuries before Christianity, making it a more established belief system than Christianity, which only became widespread after it was adopted by the Roman Empire. Therefore, atheism has a longer historical presence than Christianity.
8911	I would also like to point that atheism has existed for centuries before the establishment of Christianity, challenging the notion that atheism is inherently less established than religion. In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
8912	I would also like to point that atheism has existed for centuries before the advent of Christianity, and thus, atheism predates the establishment of Christianity, disproving your claim that the test of time favors religion over atheism. In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
8913	I would also like to point out that atheism predates Christianity, which means it has existed before the religious beliefs that came to dominate certain regions earlier on. This means atheism is capable of existing apart from these religious beliefs, making the argument that atheism must necessarily come after a religion's establishment incorrect.
8914	I would also like to point out that atheism predates Christianity, which is true. However, the presence of religion in a society can influence the prevalence of atheism over time, so this does not necessarily contradict my argument.
8915	Parents should not rely on spanking as an form of discipline, as this may lead the child feeling angry and not understanding the consequences of their actions.
8916	Parents should look for alternative methods of discipline besides spanking, as this can often lead to the child feeling angry and not understanding what they have done wrong.
8917	Parents should not use spanking as an option for disciplining children as it can lead to anger and resentment rather than teaching the child about their actions.
8918	Spanking is not an effective form of discipline as it does not allow children to understand the consequences of their actions, and may even cause them to become angry rather than understanding the consequences of their actions.
8919	While spanking is not an effective form of discipline as it can cause a child to become angry rather than understanding the consequences of their actions, physical punishment is not always the best option either. Instead, parents should strive to use positive reinforcement and other forms of guidance to help children understand their actions and the consequences of their behavior.
8920	Yes, spanking could be an option in certain cases, but talking to the child in a loving and understanding way is the best way to help them understand their behavior and provide proper guidance.
8921	No, spanking is not the solution to the problem; instead, parents should talk to the child with love and understanding, so the child understands they are doing wrong.
8922	No, spanking is not the solution to the problem; it is important to talk to the child in a loving and understanding way so that they can understand their behavior and learn the right behavior.
8923	No, spanking is not the solution to the problem; rather, talking to the child in a loving and understanding manner is a better approach, as this will help them understand their actions and behavior better.
8924	No, spanking is not the solution to the problem. Instead, it is important to talk to the child in a loving and understanding manner, so that they can understand their actions and learn to behave differently in the future.
8925	I would report her to the authorities quickly if I thought she had committed a crime such as this. All crimes, regardless of the severity, are against the law and should be investigated and punished.
8926	I would definitely report it to the authorities as quickly as possible. While murder is murder, the law considers it a serious offense, and so it is important to take appropriate action.
8927	Yes, I would turn her in quickly. While murder is murder and illegal, the crime committed by the person could be more severe depending on the crime, so it is important to report it to the authorities.
8928	I would turn her in immediately. Although the act itself is legal in some states, it is still against the law in others and can have serious consequences. It is important to consider the potential impact of the crime on the victim, their family, and the community as a whole.
8929	Yes, I would report her immediately. While murder is more serious than assault, both are illegal and potentially life-altering crimes, so I would alert the authorities immediately.
8930	While I can understand being deeply in love, I do not believe that taking someone else's life is a viable option. We can never be sure of her future decisions, so I am not willing to take that risk.
8931	I understand that some people are deeply passionate about one another, but for me, that level of commitment is still too much of a risk. Taking another life is never the answer, and while she may choose to do it again, it is still unacceptable to me.
8932	I understand that some people are very passionate about relationships, but for me, that would be too intense. Taking another person's life is never the solution, and it's impossible to know what the future holds. If she is willing to take a chance once, she may be willing to do so again.
8933	I understand that some people can be very passionate about their relationships, but for me, marrying someone else is not the solution. We cannot predict if her future partners could be compatible with me; it is all a matter of chance. If she was willing to take that risk once, she may be willing to do it again.
8934	I understand that for some people, having a lifelong partner is important, but for me, that would be too extreme. Taking someone's life is never the solution, and I believe that her choices could differ in the future.
8935	Knowing that a person has committed a crime and having to live with that knowledge can be emotionally difficult. While no crime can be ignored, it is important to recognize that any crime can have lasting effects on a victim, their family, and the community.
8936	The murder of a person is a crime that cannot be ignored; sleeping next to a person who has committed this crime and knowing about it can make you feel just as responsible as the perpetrator's victim.
8937	The murder of a person is a crime that cannot be overlooked, and knowing that a person has committed such an act can be difficult to come to terms with. It is understandable that this could cause some psychological distress, especially if the perpetrator and victim are related or live in close proximity to each other.
8938	Knowing that a person has committed a crime can be disturbing and can make it difficult to move on emotionally, particularly if you are aware of the crime and live in close proximity to the perpetrator. This can create a sense of guilt and responsibility on the part of the victim, as they are aware of the crime committed.
8939	Knowing that a person has committed a crime can be disturbing and difficult to come to terms with. Being in a relationship with someone who has committed a crime can be challenging, as it can be hard to move past the crime and have a relationship.
8940	There is no justification for abortion, as it takes away the life of a fetus, infant or child. However, in the case of rape, the victim should have the right to decide what happens to their body, as it is their own decision to make.
8941	There is no justification for abortion; abortion of a fetus, infant, child, or any life is a profoundly difficult decision and should not be taken lightly. If the woman was raped, this is particularly true; however, it is the woman’s choice and should be respected, as she is the one who knows what is best for the baby and should make the ultimate decision.
8942	There is no justification for terminating a pregnancy, as abortion ends the life of a fetus. If the woman was raped, this is traumatic and upsetting for her, but it is not the baby's fault and the woman should make this decision together with the baby, as the baby has the right to live.
8943	There is no justification for terminating a pregnancy, regardless of the stage of development of the fetus. While it is understandable that the woman may feel trauma and want to protect herself, the baby should be given the chance to live. The woman, and her family, should make this decision in consultation with the baby's family.
8944	There are many reasons why a woman may choose to terminate her pregnancy, and while this is a difficult decision, it is ultimately hers to make. No matter the situation, the baby is dependent on the mother for nutrients, and while the mother may choose to carry the baby to term if possible, it is ultimately her decision.
8945	I am not a fan of physical education as it requires me to run a lot, which I find difficult.
8946	I am not fond of physical education as it requires a lot of running and I am not a fan of running.
8947	I am not a fan of physical education as it requires me to run a lot, which I do not enjoy. However, I recognize that it is important for my health and am willing to put in the effort necessary to improve my fitness.
8948	I am not a fan of physical education as it requires me to run more than I am comfortable with, which I find tedious.
8949	I have mixed feelings about P.E. I enjoy some activities more than others, but I think the amount of running I have to do could be reduced.
8950	Physical education classes can be useful in helping overweight children gain physical fitness, as well as providing them with the knowledge and skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, this may take time and effort from the child in order to achieve this.
8951	Physical education can be beneficial for children who are overweight, as it can help them learn healthy habits and increase their activity levels. However, these benefits may take some time to become apparent, as it may take time for the child to lose weight and become a healthy weight.
8952	P.E can help children build healthy habits, even if they are overweight; however, this may take some time as it depends on the child's diet and activity level. With enough physical activity and healthy eating habits, overweight children can eventually reach a healthy weight.
8953	PE can help overweight children become more active and healthy, as they may respond to exercise and nutrition in a more positive way over time. It is possible for them to slowly reduce the amount of food they eat, as well as to increase in size as they grow, eventually returning to a healthy weight.
8954	PE can help fat kids become healthier, both in terms of weight and overall fitness, as long as the child is monitored and given the appropriate level of exercise.
8955	This idea of allowing same-sex couples to marry could have positive effects on society in the long run, even on an overpopulated Earth where global warming could potentially reduce our ability to feed ourselves. Calling it a “civil union” might satisfy some opponents of same-sex marriage, but these unions could still have an impact on society. It is important to remember that law is constantly evolving and that changes to existing legal structures can have long-term implications.
8956	Allowing gays to marry could have minimal effects on society, as population levels and the effects of climate change will significantly reduce natural resources. Some people are concerned that altering existing civil law could undermine these long-standing rules, but law should not change in this regard.
8957	Allowing same-sex couples to marry would have only minimal effects on society due to overpopulation and the effects of climate change. While some people are opposed to gay marriage due to their personal beliefs, civil unions may provide some legal protections without significantly altering existing laws.
8958	Allowing same-sex couples to have civil unions can help to address their need for legal recognition and protection, while potentially minimizing the effects of their unions on society. As population levels increase and climate change becomes more likely, these effects will be felt even more on an already stressed Earth.
8959	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a “civil union” might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Even though civil unions may have a limited effect on society, there are many aspects of law that have developed over hundreds of years that could be impacted. We should be mindful of these changes and consider their effects on society.
8960	While it is important to respect an individual's right to make their own decisions regarding marriage, it is also important to ensure that they are aware of the potential risks and benefits of marriage, particularly if they are young. Therefore, while it is ultimately up to the individual if they choose to marry, it is recommended that parental guidance and support be provided, particularly for younger generations.
8961	It is natural for people to have different views on family structures and lifestyle choices. Marriage is a personal decision and should be accepted if that is the wish of the couple. If it is something that we would accept as parents, then we would.
8962	It is important to respect the choices of others and to allow them to make their own decisions, especially when it comes to marriage. While it is natural to have feelings of concern, if someone wishes to get married, we should respect their choice.
8963	Marriage is a union that allows couples to build a life together, and while individuals should have the right to choose their own partners, it is important to consider the impact of marriage on both partners and their families. Therefore, although couples should have the freedom to marry if they choose to.
8964	Marriage is a lifelong commitment, so it is important for couples to be sure they are making the best choice for their future. While it is understandable that couples may have different opinions on this decision, it is important that both parties agree in order for the marriage to proceed. Therefore, if both parties agree to marry, then it is acceptable.
8965	I believe personal pursuit is important as it is natural to think of ourselves first. We need to be successful and happy first in order to make others happy. This way, we can make our lives better and become who we are.
8966	I think personal pursuit is the way to go. Our nature is to think of ourselves first, but I believe that for success and happiness, I need to first make myself happy. This way, I can make my life better and be who I am.
8967	I believe that personal pursuit is the way to go. It is natural to think of ourselves first, but it is also important to consider our success, happiness, and sense of self in order to make meaningful relationships and experiences.
8968	I believe that personal growth is the key to success. Everyone has the tendency to think of themselves first, as it is natural to do so. However, I believe that in order to be happy, I must make myself happier first, in order to create a better life and be who I am.
8969	I think I will opt for personal pursuit as this is human nature - to think of ourselves first. However, I also believe that it is important to make sure that I am successful, happy and confident in order to make others happy. This enables me to be true to myself and make my life better.
8970	Our instinct for survival is what enables us to react faster and enables us to sense danger more quickly. In today’s postmodern world, our instinct has changed to ensure that we can keep surviving. Times change, but our desire to survive remains the same.
8971	Our instinct for survival is what makes us flinch when we see something coming at us. It makes us react faster, and our mental state changes in response to our environment. In today’s post-modern world, our instinct to survive is still there, even though our environment changes.
8972	Our instinctive reactions are what allow us to react faster and our mental states can change accordingly. In today’s postmodern world, our instincts have adapted to the demands of survival, where we must constantly strive to obtain the resources needed to stay alive. Times have changed, but our desire to survive is still there.
8973	Our instinct for survival is what makes us react faster and gives us an advantage in both physical and mental situations. Our instincts have changed over time to keep us alive and thrive in our environment. Times have changed, but our desire to survive is still there.
8974	Our instinct for survival is what makes us flinch when we see something coming at us. It helps us react faster, as our mental state changes in response to our environment. Although our instincts change over time, our desire to survive remains the same. Times may change, but our need to survive remains ingrained in our nature.
8975	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best I can be at pole vaulting, or at anything I do. I have learned that when striving for this personal goal, I have gained a great deal of knowledge in terms of being more responsible and obedient. Pursuing personal goals has a greater impact on one's development, as it has for me.
8976	Having a personal goal to strive for is a worthwhile pursuit, as it can help to grow you as a person and provide you with more skills. This is because, if you aim to be good at something, it can help you develop both personally and professionally. Through my own experience, I have found that this process can benefit not only yourself, but also society as a whole.
8977	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best I can be at whatever I do. I have found that by chasing this goal, I have learned so much about being responsible and more obedient.

I have learned that striving to reach this personal goal has helped me grow as a person, both in terms of responsibility and obedience. Pursuing a personal goal is valuable because it helps you develop as an individual, which can benefit the world around you.
8980	For me, it is a bit of a balance. I believe that we should be mindful of each other and think of ways to further the common good. However, at the same time, we need to look out for ourselves and take steps to better our situation. For instance, when it comes to a job, we need to take steps to ensure that we are able to get a raise or better opportunities.
8981	I believe that we should take into account what will benefit the wider community, as well as our own interests, when making decisions. In terms of jobs, for example, people are likely to focus more on what improves their own situation rather than trying to help others.
8982	For me, it is a matter of balance. I think we should strive to benefit the common good, but at the same time, we need to look out for ourselves and take actions that are most beneficial to us. For instance, in a job, we are likely to take actions that improve our chances of getting a better salary.
8983	I believe that it is important to think about the common good and do our best to improve society. However, we also need to look out for ourselves and our own interests, as in real life this can help us get better positions and wages. For example, when it comes to a job, we need to focus on making ourselves look good so that we can improve our situation.
8984	My personal opinion is that everyone should be more considerate of one another and work towards benefitting the collective good. However, in the real world, we must take steps to enhance our own chances of success. For example, in a job situation, you will likely try to enhance your own prospects rather than those of your colleagues.
8985	I believe that investing in self-improvement is important in order to achieve one’s goals and become a better person. Doing this would enable an individual to help the common good, as one strives to make a positive contribution to society.
8986	I believe that it is important to prioritize personal goals first, as I believe that if you help yourself, you can ultimately help others. Becoming a better person and accomplishing your goals can give you the confidence to contribute to the common good.
8987	I believe that self-development is important as it makes you a better person and allows you to help others. Becoming a better person after achieving your goals can positively contribute to society.
8988	I believe that one should prioritize personal growth, as I believe that you must help yourself first in order to accomplish your goals, as this makes you a better person. After achieving your goals and becoming a better person, you would be able to help the common good.
8989	I believe that you should prioritize personal development first, as I believe that helping yourself is the key to achieving your goals, which will make you a better person and enable you to help the greater good.
8990	He could potentially face criminal charges, whereas she is less likely to be brought to trial since criminal charges are usually decided by the district attorney. There is a chance that civil court could be an option for her, but it is not worth the hassle to keep the car given the family dispute.
8991	He may be able to file charges in civil court, but it is unlikely that criminal charges will be brought since it is a family dispute. The decision is up to the District Attorney, who is unlikely to take on such a case due to the potential of it being one-sided.
8992	He could face criminal charges, while she may be able to bring a civil case. The district attorney's office will decide whether or not to prosecute, and it is unlikely that the case will go to trial due to the nature of the family dispute. In short, he could face charges but it is unlikely that the case will go to trial.
8993	He may be able to bring charges in criminal court; however, the DA is unlikely to pursue the case due to the defendant’s word against the neice’s, her mother’s, and grandmother’s. DA’s generally will not prosecute a case if they believe they cannot win.
8994	He could potentially face criminal charges in a case like this, while she is unlikely to be prosecuted for perjury as the DA would have to decide whether to pursue it. Civil courts are different, and it might not be worth the hassle for her to keep the car.
8995	I believe that if citizens expect law enforcement to be able to carry out certain duties, they should be empowered by legislation to take the necessary actions, including the use of force. Additionally, greater involvement of citizens in community policing is important, as Neighborhood Watch programs can help reduce demands on police.
8996	I believe that, in order for law enforcement to be able to fulfill its duties, it should be empowered to take the necessary actions, including the use of force. Additionally, I think citizens should be more involved in community policing; neighborhood watch programs are great and could be expanded to meet the needs of the community.
8997	I believe that if the public expects law enforcement to be able to do a certain job, then they should have the power and authority to take the necessary actions, such as the use of force, to carry out their duties. Additionally, involving citizens more in community policing can help reduce demands on police officers, which can be beneficial for the community.
8998	I believe that if we expect law enforcement to be able to do a certain job, then they should be empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including the use of force, in order to carry out their duties. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community policing, such as through the Neighborhood Watch program, which could help reduce crime and make communities safer.
8999	I believe that, in order for law enforcement to be able to do its job, it must be empowered to take necessary actions, including the use of force. Furthermore, I believe that citizens should be more involved in community policing through neighborhood watch programs, as this would reduce the demand on police officers.
9000	I believe that criminal laws are enacted to protect individuals, groups, and society as a whole, and the effects of an action must be taken into consideration to determine if it causes harm to society. For example, some aspects of prostitution, such as working a street corner, could be made illegal in order to protect neighborhoods. Legalizing and regulating such activities in licensed brothels could be appropriate.
9001	I do not believe that there are any victims-free crimes; it is necessary to look at the full impact of an action in order to determine if it harms society. For example, some aspects of prostitution, such as working a street corner, can cause harm to a neighborhood, which is why legalizing and regulating it in licensed brothels could be appropriate.
9002	I do not believe that there are any 'victimless crimes', as these laws are enacted to protect society as a whole. We must consider the full effect of an action to determine if it is harmful to society. For example, some aspects of prostitution, such as working on a street corner, can cause harm to a neighborhood and should remain illegal.
9003	I do not believe that there are any victimless crimes; it is important to consider the full effect of the action to determine whether or not it harms society. For instance, prostitution should be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries, in order to minimize the potential harm to neighborhoods. Working a street corner would remain illegal if this activity is moved to licensed brothels.
9004	I believe laws are enacted to protect society as a whole, even if individual actions seem to cause no harm. In some cases, such as prostitution, regulation can help to minimize these harms, while keeping certain aspects illegal.
9005	Yes it is illegal in the USA, however there have been cases of it being done successfully. The individual I know who has done it has never had an issue with the medications and has not had any issues with Customs or the Postal Inspector. It is not recommended for drugs needed to treat serious life-threatening conditions due to the questionable quality, but it could be done if the drug is needed and the individual lives far from the Mexican border, where they can just go and purchase the medication.  Generally, if a person searches online for the drug they need, they will likely find an overseas website that offers the drug for sale.
9006	It is illegal in the US to purchase medications from outside of the country, however, it is possible to do so. The individual I know who has done it has never had an issue with the medications (in this case from India) and has not had any problems with Customs or the Postal Inspector. I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious, life-threatening conditions as the quality might be questionable. For other drugs, I would consider purchasing them if I do not live close to the Mexico border, where I can just purchase the medications there. If you Google the drug name you need, you will likely find an overseas website that offers it for sale.
9007	It is possible to purchase medications from overseas online pharmacies, although this can be risky. Customs and the Postal Inspector usually do not have an issue with it, however the quality of the medication could be questionable in some cases. It is generally best to use such sources for less serious conditions, although this should be avoided for more serious conditions as the quality of the medication could be an issue. Additionally, online purchases should be conducted with caution due to the illegality of the practice.
9008	Yes, it is illegal in the US to purchase medications from other countries. However, it is possible to do so with minimal risk. The person I know has never had any issues with the medications, even though they were from India, or with Customs or the Postal Inspector. I would be cautious with drugs needed to treat serious, life-threatening conditions, but for other medications I would take the risk if I do not live close to the Mexican border, where I can easily buy cheaper prescription meds. Google searches of the drug name could lead to overseas sites that offer it for sale.
9009	It is legal to purchase prescription drugs from outside the US, but it is recommended to only do so if the quality is assured. There have been reports of successful purchases without any issues with Customs or the Postal Inspector. Google searches can lead to websites offering the drug for sale.
9010	Although legally, the landlord may have the right to retain some or all of the deposit, it is rare for this to happen. Generally, landlords must return the deposit if the tenant moves out in accordance with the terms of the rental agreement. If the tenant believes the property is not legally compliant, the tenant should speak with the landlord and determine whether the issue can be resolved or if the tenant should look for other accommodation. The tenant should also ensure that they have valid Corgi certificates, working appliances and that the property meets safety regulations.
9011	Although technically, the previous answers are right (you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don’t pay him. He may be attempting to take advantage of you, as he could try to retain your money by claiming ‘damage deposits’ or other reasons. To avoid this, it would be best to talk to a lawyer to ensure your rights are protected. Additionally, if you are moving out at the end of December, he would have to go through legal proceedings to evict you.
9012	Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and do not pay him. Although legally, the tenant is responsible for the cost of repairs, in reality, the landlord may take this situation to court in order to retain the deposit if they believe the tenant caused damage to the property. Therefore, it is advisable to find alternative accommodation as soon as possible. Good luck!
9013	Although technically, the previous answers are right ( you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and don't pay him!  He might be trying to take advantage of you, as the property might not have been legally compliant, so it is best to be cautious and not pay him until you are sure you will get your full deposit back. As you are moving out at the end of December, he would likely need to go through legal proceedings to evict you.
9014	Yes, technically you should pay the rent as stated in your contract, however it is better to hold onto the money in this situation. Your landlord could try to keep the deposit by claiming it was deducted for cleaning or maintenance fees, but this is rare and would involve him going through legal proceedings. It is best to stay out of court unless absolutely necessary.  You should also be aware that the property may not have met all safety regulations and standards, so it is important to do your research before moving in.
9015	I went to Prague, and while it is more accepting of sex than other places, the culture is still quite conservative. However, the local bar had strippers and escorts were available on request, which was quite intriguing. I personally found this to be quite seedy, but it may be more acceptable to some people depending on their preferences.
9016	I went to Prague, and while the culture is less uptight about sex in general, the local bars did have strippers and escorts were able to be delivered to customers' doors within minutes. However, I personally found the environment a bit seedy.
9017	I went to Prague, and while the culture is more relaxed about sex in general, I found that the local bars had strippers and escorts were available at relatively short notice if you wanted them. I don't think the situation is as liberal as some places, but I personally found it to be a bit seedy.
9018	I went to Prague, and while the atmosphere was more relaxed than I expected, there were still some limitations in place. The local bars had strippers and escorts could be sent to your door within minutes, although I believe this is still legal in some countries. As a woman, I found this to be slightly intrusive.
9019	I went to Prague and the culture is much more open about sex. The local bars had strippers and escorts could be brought to customers’ doors within minutes, which I found a bit seedy. It wasn't my thing as a woman.
9020	To set a uniform standard is important. Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by. This is usually taught by parents, society, or government as the child grows. Sometimes this teaching does not take effect, or the child may decide the rules their parents set are not for them. Legislators try to find a balance between what is acceptable and what is not.
9021	To set a uniform standard is important in order to have a cohesive society. We all have our own standards and beliefs that are instilled in us as children, though these may differ from our parents’ beliefs. We may choose to differ from our parents’ views, or choose to adopt the societal values at some point. Legislators strive to create laws that balance the needs of the people.
9022	To set a uniform standard is important so that everyone has the same understanding of what is right and wrong. In some cases, this standard is instilled in us as children by our parents, while in other cases society takes over in teaching us its rules. Governments try to find the right balance to keep things running smoothly.
9023	To set a uniform standard is important. Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by, which is usually taught to us by our parents when we are young. However, sometimes our parents’ teachings do not take effect, or we decide that the rules our parents set down are not for us. In such cases, society often steps in to fill the gap. Legislators strive to take a middle path in order to set rules that are beneficial for everyone.
9024	To set a uniform standard is important. We all have our own set of standards and ethics that are instilled in us as children, but these can change over time. Legislators attempt to find a balance between different societies' values to ensure the rules are beneficial for everyone. This is a matter of choice, although it is influenced by society and laws. Legislators aim to find a middle path between multiple interests.
9025	Yes, the government currently provides access to medical marijuana to treat terminal illnesses and allows it to be taxed to help bring the country out of the deficit. Canada has implemented regulations for the sale of marijuana seeds, which has helped the country significantly increase its income. Marijuana could potentially help reduce the number of drug-related crimes, as well as provide relief to sick people in order to alleviate pain.
9026	Yes, the government currently taxes it in order to help the country recover economically. Despite this, there have been few deaths related to marijuana use, since its effects are relatively mild compared to other substances. Moreover, Canada has a man named Mark Emery, who has become a large source of income for the country through the sale of marijuana seeds. This has enabled the government to have no debt. Additionally, the use of marijuana could help reduce drug-related crimes in the US, and would be beneficial in providing relief to sick people in certain cases.
9027	Yes, the government already allows medicinal use of marijuana to treat terminal illnesses, and they can tax it to help bring the country out of the deficit. Additionally, Canada has a leader named Mark Emery, who has brought the country considerable income through selling marijuana seeds. Further, the U.S.A would benefit from the legalization of marijuana, as it could help ease the pain for sick patients and reduce drug-related crimes.
9028	Yes, the government already grows and distributes marijuana to terminally ill patients in some states, and they can tax it to help bring in much-needed revenue for the government. Although there have been some cases of marijuana-related accidents, the risk is much lower than other forms of transportation, as marijuana users typically drive no faster than 10 miles per hour. Canada has benefited greatly from selling marijuana seeds, as Mark Emery, known as the ‘Prince of Pot’, has brought the country considerable income. Furthermore, legalization could help reduce drug-related crimes in the US, and could provide some relief for sick individuals who need it to ease their pain.
9029	Yes, the government already grows and distributes it to terminally ill patients, and they can tax it to help bring the country out of the deficit. Moreover, Canada has made considerable profits from selling marijuana seeds, which has helped them eliminate debt. Also, marijuana can help ease the pain for sick patients, which is why I am in favor of it.
9030	In my personal opinion, guns should be limited to law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens. Although guns can serve as a deterrent to crime and provide protection to law-abiding citizens, the potential for misuse is still too great.
9031	In some countries, citizens are allowed to possess firearms, but I personally believe this should be limited to law enforcement officials, as guns can be dangerous and have the potential to cause great harm.
9032	In my personal opinion, guns should be restricted to law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens, as I believe that could potentially lead to serious violence and death. While owning a firearm is an individual right in some parts of the world, I feel that this should be regulated to ensure public safety.
9033	Guns should be regulated more strictly, with the possession and use of firearms being limited to law enforcement officials. In some cases, citizens are able to purchase guns without obtaining a license, which I feel is a potential risk as these weapons can cause harm.
9034	In my personal opinion, guns should be restricted to law enforcement officials, as the potential for violence is always there with guns, even when they are fake.  With guns in the hands of ordinary citizens, there is always the risk that a weapon can cause death or serious injury, regardless of the intent or context.
9035	Answering questions can be beneficial in many ways. It allows people to gain knowledge and gain insight from the experience of others. Answering questions also allows people to share their knowledge and experience with others. Furthermore, it can be useful to have an idea of how certain situations are handled in different jurisdictions. This can help people make informed decisions in their particular cases.
9036	Answering questions is a great way to gain knowledge and gain understanding on a particular topic. While answering questions can be beneficial, it is important to make sure that the answer is accurate and based on reliable sources of information. Small claims courts are a useful option for parties who do not want to involve lawyers as it allows them to handle cases with smaller amounts. In such cases, parties can ask for relief, such as having the car transferred to their name or having payments refunded with interest.
9037	Sue.  On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief.  Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name.  Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you.  Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one of these two remedies, possibly with interest.
9038	I understand that small claims court is designed to handle cases that are smaller in nature and do not involve lawyers. My case is such that I believe I should be awarded the car in my name or for all payments made on the car to be returned to me. If the court denies me this, I would be willing to accept alternative relief.
9039	Answering questions is a great way to gain knowledge and get a better understanding of a situation. It can also be beneficial to get input from people who are knowledgeable in the area. In small claims court, it is possible to ask for relief other than getting the car transferred into the plaintiff’s name, such as getting all payments made on the car refunded. If the court denies this request, the plaintiff is also entitled to receive interest.
9040	Something is missing from the story.  I took a look at the statute and it says that the County can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail" as more fully described in the statute.  The statute is clear that a conviction is required.  If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay.  If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to “time served”, then the County can seek reimbursement.  If you were found not guilty or the charges were dismissed, then the County cannot seek reimbursement.
9041	Something is missing from the story.  The statute states that the County can seek reimbursement for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail.  The statute is clear that a conviction is required.  If you were found guilty and sentenced to county jail, then you must pay.  If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to “time served”, then the County can seek reimbursement.
9042	Something is missing from the story.  The statute states that the county can seek reimbursement for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail.  Thus, the county can seek reimbursement in these instances, regardless of whether a conviction was obtained.  If a plea agreement was reached and the person was sentenced to ‘time served’, the county can still seek reimbursement.

9045	Lawyers are motivated by a combination of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers. So, yes lawyers are trying to make you money but, the bottom line is their pocket-book, not yours!!! So, this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big but, the lawyers assume lots of risk in civil matters--which in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So, before lawyers take on many civil cases, they will pose some really important questions, such as whether the case is winnable and whether it is worth their time--considering how much they could potentially earn. Civil law is still a popular area of law, but immigration law is a particularly popular area.
9046	Lawyers generally represent clients in civil matters in order to generate income. Civil law is still a popular area of law, but there is a greater need now for immigration lawyers. In order to maximize potential earnings, lawyers must weigh the risks of each case carefully and consider the amount of money they could potentially make.
9047	Lawyers are motivated by a combination of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers. Civil law is still a popular area of law but, there is a huge need now for immigration lawyers. So, if law is your interest then consider that area.
9048	Lawyers are motivated by a combination of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers. So, yes lawyers are trying to make you money but, the bottom line is their pocket-book, not yours!!! Civil law is still a popular area of law but, there is a huge need now for immigration lawyers. So, if law is your interest then consider that area.
9049	Lawyers represent clients in civil matters in order to generate income. Without civil disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for lawyers. Lawyers assess risk in civil cases carefully, weighing the potential rewards before taking them on. Ultimately, both sides can win in civil cases, as lawyers strive to maximize the potential rewards for their clients. This is especially true when lawyers have an interest in the case and its outcome.
9050	Civil marriage, which is defined and regulated by the government, is not religious in nature. It is the government’s right and responsibility to define it. I believe the government has the power to determine the parameters of marriage, as long as it does not discriminate against any groups, such as homosexuals. Additionally, the government can decide whether or not it will recognize a particular marriage.
9051	Civil marriage (i.e. the license you get when you get married) is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is in its very nature controlled by the government and government thus has the right and responsibility to define it. I don’t think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government’s prerogative to define it. Churches may be able to perform the ceremony, but the government is the only body that can legally recognize the marriage if the government chooses to do so.
9052	Marriage, as defined by the government, is not religious in any way. It is the government's responsibility to define it and regulate it, in order to ensure that the institution is protected and equitable for all. While it is appropriate for the government to ensure that couples are treated fairly and equally, it is still within the government's right to regulate marriage. If couples choose to hold a ceremony, it is possible to have it legally recognized.
9053	Civil marriage, as regulated by the government, is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is the government's responsibility to define it, as it has the right and obligation to set the rules for marriage. Although the government should not discriminate against certain groups, such as homosexuals, it has the final say on what is legally recognized. If couples want to have a ceremony, they can choose whatever or whomever they like, but only the government can decide if it will be recognized.
9054	Civil marriage, which is controlled by the government, has its origins in law and is thus defined by the government. The government is entitled to set boundaries in order to prevent discrimination against certain groups, such as homosexuals, while still retaining control over the definition of marriage. If couples wish to have a ceremony, the government is the ultimate authority in whether or not it will be recognized.
9055	Yes, there are many programs available to help felons reintegrate into society. You may be able to go back to school depending on your desired field and receive financial aid from the government. You should contact your local Department of Human Services or Child Protective Services to find out more information. Good luck!
9056	Depending on your desired field, you may be able to go back to school with the help of government aid programs. Check with your local Department of Human Services or Child Protective Services to find out more information.
9057	Yes, there are many programs designed to help former felons reintegrate into society, such as going back to school with the help of federal and state financial aid. You can check with your local Department of Health or Children's Services to find out more information about these programs. Good luck!
9058	There are many programs available to felons to help them get their life back on track. Depending on your desired field, you may be able to go back to school and receive financial aid from the government. You should contact your local Department of Human Services or Child Protective Services for more information.
9059	There are many programs available for felons to help them get their life back on track. This may include the opportunity to go back to school, depending on the desired field, which may be paid for by the government. You should contact your local DHS or CPS office to access this information. Good luck!
9060	In terms of this subject, I believe it is important to gather as much information as possible in order to make an informed decision. Videos, such as the one I have linked, give one perspective on the matter, however it is only one of many. I believe there is value in considering all of the available evidence in order to reach an accurate conclusion.
9061	That video, as well as many other videos on the subject, can be found at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda, especially since the White House has released videos on the subject. It is difficult to know the full facts as there are many discrepancies on both sides of the argument.
9062	I believe that there is significant evidence to suggest that the virus can spread from person to person through close contact, such as shaking hands, as well as through respiratory droplets when people are in close proximity to each other. This suggests that physical distancing and contact tracing are effective methods of reducing the spread of the virus. Additionally, I believe that more research is needed to determine the full impact of the virus on human health.
9063	That video, along with many others on the topic, can be found at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. While I recognize that there are facts that cannot be known in this situation, there are still too many inconsistencies on both sides of the argument to form an accurate conclusion.
9064	It is understandable to have doubts about the information available on this subject. However, videos such as the one I linked can give us insight into the situation. While the facts may be open to interpretation, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the situation by studying multiple sources.
9065	India and Pakistan have had a difficult history, with tensions between the two nations remaining high in recent years. However, the Indian government has been working to improve relations, which has led to some improvements in the relationship. This has caused concern amongst terrorists, who fear losing their jobs and hence attack Pakistan more actively. It may take some time for terrorism to end entirely if the same policies continue.
9066	As India and Pakistan continue to strengthen their relationship, terrorist groups in Pakistan have become increasingly nervous about losing their influence in the region. This has led to terrorist attacks in Pakistan increasingly targeting India, which could potentially destabilize the improvement of ties between the two countries.
9067	As both countries recognize, Pakistan has played a role in militant activities in India in the past. With the Indian government working to strengthen ties between the two countries, terrorists are becoming increasingly afraid of losing their influence, leading them to turn against Pakistan. It will take time for these ties to improve significantly.
9068	As India and Pakistan continue to work towards better relations, the terrorist threat in India has become more visible. This is due to the Government’s efforts to improve ties between the two countries, something that has caused terrorists to feel threatened. It is likely to take time to eliminate terrorism completely if the same procedure continues.
9069	It is true that Pakistan has been used as a base for terrorist groups operating in India in the past. However, the Indian government is now taking steps to improve relations between the two countries, which has caused a great deal of concern among terrorists. Terrorist groups are thus increasingly turning their attention to Pakistan in order to maintain their activities.
9070	No, the police cannot enter a residence without the permission of the residence's owner or a court-issued warrant. While police officers are generally allowed to enter a residence without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion that someone's life is in danger, they must always obtain a warrant if the situation allows.
9071	No. Police officers need either the permission of the house's owner or a warrant to search the house, as the 4th Amendment of the US Constitution requires that police must have reasonable suspicion that someone's life is in danger to enter a property without permission.
9072	No. Cops need a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger to enter a house without the permission of the owner.
9073	No. Cops need the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger unless the owner of the house is present, in which case police are allowed to enter the house with permission from the owner.
9074	No. Cops need the permission of the owner of the house or a court-issued warrant to search it, as the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution requires that search and seizure be subject to reasonable grounds and probable cause that someone's life is in danger.
9075	The United States Constitution guarantees one person one vote in federal elections, though the amount of influence an individual vote has depends on the population of the state being voted on. State laws and local governments can also affect the electoral process. In recent years, money has become a more significant factor in elections, with more possibility for individuals to influence elections through financial contributions.
9076	The principle of 'one man one vote' has existed since the beginning of our representative democracy, but now it is more evident that our government favors 'one dollar one vote' as well. It is true that money has more power in politics, but citizens can still make their voices heard if they save up enough money. This is the nature of our government, which is operated as a republic.
9077	The truth is that the United States does not have a system of 'one man one vote,' which has become more apparent recently. Our government is instead based on 'one dollar one vote,' meaning that money is the deciding factor in elections. This is the nature of a representative democracy, which gives more power to those who can afford it. If we want to make changes, we must accumulate wealth in order to become influential.
9078	The United States Constitution establishes a representative democracy, where each state is represented in the Congress according to its population. This ensures that larger states have greater clout in the legislative process than smaller ones. This has been the case since the founding of the nation, and it is not likely to change in the near future.
9079	While the United States Constitution guarantees one vote per person, this is more hidden now as money has a greater influence on elections than ever before. This is a reflection of the nature of a representative democracy, where the wealthy can have a greater say in elections than the poor. This is true of the US government, which is a representation of the people's will, but also of the state's power.
9080	While the courts have the discretion to decide how a summons should be served in certain cases, in general the recipient must be present for service to be valid. Therefore, it is important that the person to whom the summons is delivered is the same person the court intends to serve. Accepting a summons on someone’s behalf could potentially invalidate service.
9081	Acceptance of a court summons is generally done in person, which makes it necessary to serve the summons to the person in question, not their dog, colleagues, or other relatives or acquaintances. While it is understandable that the person receiving the summons may feel uneasy about it, the sender has the right to make sure that the summons was delivered in accordance with the law. Therefore, the sender should ensure that the summons is delivered to the right person.
9082	Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A subpoena is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being to the person in question, not the person's dog or girlfriend or stupid coworkers. By accepting the subpoena, you made it easy for the server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact it was not. To make an analogical comparison, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit. Are you that nosy for someone?
9083	Accepting a subpoena is generally accepted in order to ensure delivery of the document. The process allows the person to verify that service was made, which is important in order to fulfill any legal obligations. As such, it is acceptable for the recipient to accept service on behalf of the destination person.

9085	Jr. has a different interpretation of his role as President, but the Constitution is the supreme law of the United States and the President’s main responsibility is to defend and uphold it.
9086	Although the Constitution outlines the fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans, some presidents have the discretion to make decisions that depart from the document's original intent. Junior's interpretation of his role as president is that he has the authority to lead and unite the people of the United States, rather than prioritizing the protection of the Constitution.
9087	Although Jr. has been made aware of his constitutional responsibilities, he may not always identify it as his primary duty. It is up to the President to ensure the Constitution is upheld, which is one of the primary responsibilities of the President's office.
9088	Junior understands that his role is to uphold and defend the Constitution, which includes ensuring that all individuals are afforded equal rights and protections under the law, as determined by the Supreme Court.
9089	Jr. is correct that his job is to protect and defend the Constitution, as outlined by the Constitution and laws of the United States. While he believes that his job is to lead and unite Americans, his responsibility is to ensure that the laws passed by Congress are upheld and that the Constitution is defended. He is also charged with the duty of upholding the Constitution and ensuring it is not violated.
9090	Having the legislature pass such a law would be acceptable to me, as it meets the purpose of the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment. It may have some drawbacks if there is potential litigation if people start suing towns and counties to recoup what they believe they could have lost in another part of the area, but this can be avoided by writing the law intelligently.
9091	Passing a law like this could be beneficial, as it would allow the state to enforce laws which ensure local governments play nicely with each other. It satisfies the purpose of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, although there is the potential for costly litigation if people sue to recoup losses due to zoning rules in other areas. To prevent this, the law must be written carefully.
9092	Assuming such compensation could be reasonably calculated, I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law that more closely aligns with the intent of the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment. While the cost of litigation could be an issue, if the state wants to ensure towns play nice, that could be beneficial for all parties involved.
9093	The enactment of a law that establishes a set of minimum property rights for landowners could be beneficial, as it would meet the requirements of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause. However, there is a potential that legal costs could increase if lawsuits become more common as a result of such laws. Writing the legislation in a way to avoid these loopholes would be necessary to ensure its effectiveness.
9094	I believe that if the value of the compensation can be reasonably determined, a law such as this meets the intent of the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment. Additionally, I believe that if the state wishes to increase harmony between towns, this type of legislation could be beneficial.
9095	I believe that abortion is a personal decision and every woman should have the right to make that decision for herself. While I would never choose to have an abortion, I understand that some women feel they have no choice but to do so due to the situation they are in. From a moral standpoint, I believe it is wrong to take away a woman’s right to choose what is best for her and her child, as every situation is unique.
9096	I believe that abortion is a personal choice and that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. However, I would not choose to have an abortion as I believe there are other options available that provide more protection and safety for the mother. Ultimately, each woman must make the choice that is right for them based on their situation.
9097	I believe that abortion is a difficult decision and while I believe it should be a woman's choice, I would not choose to have an abortion myself. I understand why women choose to do so, due to situational factors, but it is not something I would feel is right for me.
9098	I believe that it is important to have safe, legal abortion options available, especially in cases of emergency and where there is a legal requirement for abortion to be performed. However, I personally would not have an abortion as I believe it is wrong to take away a life, even in such situations. Every individual has their own situation and reasons for making this choice, and while I understand that, I believe it is not the right option for me.
9099	I believe abortion is an intensely personal decision and every woman should be able to make the decision that is right for them. While I personally would not have an abortion, I think it is important to ensure that women have safe and clean options to access if they feel they need to terminate their pregnancy.
9100	It is important to understand the consequences of a settlement offer. It is best to write down your questions and then meet with your lawyer to discuss them. Generally, the settlement will involve the payment of all medical bills, as well as the $20,000 settlement for your pain and suffering. The lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 or 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending on the terms of your agreement.
9101	Your settlement offer may involve having all medical bills paid, and the $20,000 settlement is for your pain and suffering. Generally, your lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 or 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending on the terms of your engagement. So it is likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will receive the $20,000, with the attorney fee paid from this amount.
9102	Your settlement offer includes having all medical bills paid, as well as compensation for your pain and suffering. Your lawyer will typically take a fee (either a third or a quarter of the settlement) as his fee. So it is likely that the settlement will pay for all medical bills and provide you with the $20,000 compensation.
9103	Your post is a little unclear.  In any event, these are really questions you should be asking your lawyer.  It's his job to help you understand the consequences of accepting any settlement offer.  Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him.  I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering.  Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him.  So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the attorney to pay his fee.
9104	Your settlement offer may include having medical bills paid and a lump sum for your pain and suffering. Your lawyer can help you understand the terms of the settlement and the fees that will be deducted from the settlement amount. It is important to write down any questions you have and discuss them with your lawyer.
9105	In a society, it is important to ensure that people have access to essential services, such as health care and education, regardless of their ability to pay. Thus, it is important to provide some level of subsidy or support to make these services more accessible to those who may not be able to afford them.
9106	People should have the right to choose what they can afford, as allowing people to make their own decisions about their lives is key to a healthy society. Forcing people to pay for things they cannot afford can be restricting and unfair.
9107	Governments have a responsibility to ensure that people are able to access essential services, such as healthcare and food, regardless of ability to pay. While there is a balance to be struck between the needs of individuals and the needs of the greater community, it is important that governments provide the necessary support to enable individuals to live healthy and productive lives.
9108	It is important to ensure that people are able to access essential services like healthcare and food, and it is unfair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.
9109	In some cases, such as with healthcare, it is important to ensure that people can access necessary services, and forcing people to pay for things they cannot afford can be unnecessarily restrictive.
9110	It is understandable that this is a difficult situation, but recordings of deeds are not necessary for all states. Depending on the state, the notarization may need to be filed with the court or the state, but this information may be available from the title company or attorney.   To correct this, you may want to speak to an attorney or the relevant authorities to make sure that all rules and regulations are followed.
9111	Sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent.  First of all this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and YOU.   Put all this together can create legal issues and cause delays in the transfer of the property, which can be avoided if the correct procedures are followed.  To avoid such issues, it is important to follow the proper protocols established by the state.  Working with an experienced attorney can help ensure that the process is completed correctly and without any issues.      If you want to correct this situation I would certainly be the first one to speak to the authorities about this. Deeds must be recorded by the state so finding out about this is easy.  The “real” inheritor won’t have to look too hard to find out what has happened.
9112	Sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent.  First of all this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and YOU.    Put all this together and the crime begins with CONSPIRACY!  This violates most state notary laws, attorney responsiblity rules, not to mention fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes.     If you want to correct this situation I would certainly be the first one to speak to the authorities about this. Deeds must be recorded by the state so finding out about this is easy.  The “real” inheritor won’t have to look too hard to find out what has happened.
9113	Sounds like you need a different attorney, a bail bond agent, and a notary. First of all, this can lead to criminal charges, so it is important to take action as soon as possible.  Notary laws, attorney responsibilities, and state recording laws must all be taken into account to prevent these kinds of issues.  The “inheritor” should be aware of the situation as soon as it arises, to protect their interests.  It is best to contact the authorities as soon as possible.

I would recommend contacting an attorney as soon as possible in order to take the necessary steps to resolve the situation.
9115	The notarization of a deed by an attorney is a standard practice, and the attorney may charge a fee for the service. The circumstances surrounding the transfer of the property may influence the decision of the grantor in terms of whether they want the transfer to be notarized. In some cases, the grantor may choose to have the deed notarized for their own protection.
9116	It is common practice for an attorney to have notarization authority as part of their practice. While the specific facts of a case may dictate whether it is appropriate for a client to sign a deed, in general it is possible for clients to sign deeds if they choose to do so, with the guidance of their attorney.
9117	Let's start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you should have a factual basis for doing so. You have nothing. As far as the signing of the quitclaim deed is concerned, it is common practice for an attorney to sign documents as a notary on behalf of a client in order to ensure validity and enforceability of the document. This is done to ensure that the client receives the intended benefit of the document, which in this case was to transfer the title of the property to their name. Such actions are done to ensure the client's interests are looked after and it is standard practice amongst lawyers. There are benefits to having a lawyer perform these acts, as it provides greater assurance that the document will be enforceable and will have the intended effect. Attorneys often do this as a matter of course for their clients.  In this case, the mother executed the quitclaim deed to benefit the daughter, which is in line with what a client would expect from their attorney. Again, this is a practice that is standard amongst lawyers to provide the intended benefit for the client.
9118	It is common practice for an attorney to notarize documents on behalf of clients, in order to ensure the validity of the document. As the client's attorney, the attorney-in-fact is ethically bound to ensure the client's interests are represented. In this case, the client's mother had a quitclaim deed notarized to benefit her own interests.
9119	It is common practice for an attorney to serve as a notary, which allows them to ensure that documents are properly executed and witnessed in accordance with the law. Although it is possible for family members to serve as a notary, having an attorney serve in this capacity can provide an added layer of security. As for the quitclaim deed, it is quite common for families to have documents signed over to ensure the security of the property, which may provide some peace of mind to the family in such circumstances.
9120	Many people may chose to have an abortion if they find themselves in a difficult situation, believing that it is the best choice for them. However, some pro-lifers may be more willing to keep the baby if they feel it is in the best interests of the child, allowing for exceptions depending on the circumstances.
9121	Yes, if a woman is in a position where she does not want a child, she may choose to have an abortion. In some cases, the woman's own views on abortion may be more flexible, while she may still choose to terminate the pregnancy. However, when it comes to other women's reproductive choices, these same pro-choice people may be more inclined to support abortion rights.
9122	Many people have a change of heart regarding abortion if they find themselves in a position where they do not want a child. Pro-choice advocates recognize that this decision is highly personal and that circumstances can change. It is important to consider why a woman may choose to terminate the pregnancy if she is pro-choice in some cases, but anti-abortion in others.
9123	In some cases, a woman may choose to have an abortion if she does not want a child at that point in time. Pro-choicers generally support abortion in these situations, but anti-abortion laws may come into play depending on the country's laws.
9124	Abortion should be legal in cases where the pregnancy is not desired as it can be difficult to make the best decision for the situation. However, some pro-lifers may opt for abortion if they are in a position where they feel it is right for them, while still opposing it when it involves other people.
9125	It is essential that everyone follows the laws of the country, including illegal aliens and their employers. The laws on the books already allow fines of $250,000, plus imprisonment, as well as deportation of illegal aliens. This should serve as a deterrent, to ensure that people follow the law.
9126	It is important that all persons follow the laws of the country, including illegal aliens. The laws on the books can impose fines of $250,000 for illegal aliens, plus imprisonment, as well as deportation. This is necessary to ensure compliance with the law.
9127	It is important to uphold the laws of the country, and the punishments set forth in those laws, to ensure that everyone is treated equally under the law. In the case of illegal aliens, the current laws provide the possibility of a $250,000 fine, imprisonment, and deportation, which gives the government the ability to enforce the law.
9128	What they are doing is not right. There are laws on our books that allow our government to fine illegal aliens up to $250,000, as well as imprisonment, and deportation. There are also laws in place to prevent employers from hiring undocumented workers, which they must abide by. This needs to be followed by everyone.
9129	The current laws in place provide avenues to penalize both illegal aliens and employers of such aliens. Fines of up to $250,000 can be levied, as well as imprisonment, in addition to deportation. This should serve as a deterrent and ensure that people follow the laws of the country.
9130	THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PERSON'S CASE. IN SOME CASES, A JUDGE CAN REQUIRE A PERSON TO BE RE-EVALUATED IF HE/SHE DETERMINES THAT THE PERSON GIVING THE EVALUATION WAS BIASED AGAINST THE PERSON BEING EVALUATED. BUT, NO, A PERSON CANNOT BE RE-EVALUATED JUST TO SATISFY THE JUDGE'S WHIMS.
9131	THAT WOULD DEPEND ON THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION. IN SOME CASES, THE JUDGE CAN SEND A PERSON FOR RE-EVALUATION IF HE/SHE DETERMINES THAT THE PERSON WHO GAVE THE EVALUATION WAS BIASED TOWARD THE PERSON BEING EVALUATED. HOWEVER, NO, A PERSON CANNOT BE RE-EVALUATED ONLY TO SATISFY THE JUDGE'S WHIMS.
9132	It would depend on whether the judge determined that the person being evaluated was biased. In some cases, the judge can require re-evaluation if they deem it necessary. However, a person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the judge's whims.
9133	Depending on the situation, a judge may order a person to be re-evaluated if they believe the evaluator to be biased against the person being evaluated. However, a person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the judge's whims.
9134	That would depend on whether the judge determined that the person being evaluated was biased. In some cases, the judge can require re-evaluation if they believe there was bias. However, no, a person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the judge's whims.
9135	Since this is a family member, you should try to come to a resolution by talking to them privately and letting them know that you are not happy with the situation. You could also suggest counseling if it was for a valid reason. Demanding repayment of the money may not be the best approach, as it could lead to a negative outcome.
9136	Since this is a family member, you need to work things out. Confront them privately and make it clear that they must repay what they took, both from you and your family as a whole. While you understand that their situation may have been difficult, this is not acceptable behavior. Do not fall for sob stories; instead, try to find out why they took the money. If it was for a valid reason, then you need to be firm but fair. If it was for gambling, drugs, etc., then demand that they get counseling.
9137	Since this is a family member, you need to work things out in a respectful manner. Confront them privately and explain why they took the money, while also making it clear that you expect the money to be repaid. Additionally, demand that they receive counselling if needed. It is important to be firm yet fair in these situations. Avoid getting the police involved if possible, and make sure that the money is repaid in full.
9138	Since this is a family member, you need to have a conversation to work things out. Confront them privately and explain why they took the money. Depending on the reason, you may choose to counsel them. If it was for a valid reason, you can agree on a repayment plan. Ensure that the money is repaid in full.  If there are genuine mitigating circumstances, you may wish to offer assistance or counseling.
9139	Since this is a family member, you have to work things out. Confront them privately and tell them to stop it. However, it is important to find a balance between setting boundaries and showing empathy.  Counselling could be an option, especially if the situation warrants it.  It is also important to set clear boundaries that are enforceable, in order to ensure that the situation is handled appropriately.
9140	Marijuana should be legalised in all regions as it is a natural herb that provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. Studies suggest it can relieve stress, reduce pain, and show positive effects on asthma and Alzheimer's patients. The initial prohibition was due to the oil from the marijuana seeds being able to fuel an engine, an action that was driven by the oil lobby and the media which had a financial interest in cutting down trees. This law was passed as part of the tax law, thus introducing the name marijuana to the public.
9141	Marijuana should be legalized in all jurisdictions, as its use can provide pleasure and relaxation, as well as certain medicinal benefits. It has been found to relieve stress, reduce pain, and may have beneficial effects on patients with asthma and Alzheimer's.  The initial prohibition of marijuana was driven by the oil lobby and media outlets, which used the tax law to their advantage to make it illegal. Thus, the drug's usage was masked under the term'marijuana'.
9142	Marijuana should be legalised in all countries as it is a natural herb with many beneficial properties. Studies have shown that it can provide relief from stress, pain, and can be beneficial for patients of asthma and Alzheimer's. Its oil can be used to fuel an engine, leading to the law being passed as a part of the tax law, which made its use illegal by generating fear among the public through the media.
9143	Marijuana should be legalised in all jurisdictions, as it is a natural herb with many beneficial effects. Its primary active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can be used to fuel an engine, and so there is some evidence of an oil lobby and media profiting from the restriction of hemp. This law was passed through taxation and the introduction of the name marijuana to the public.
9144	Marijuana should be legalised in all states as it is a natural herb with many beneficial medicinal properties. It can provide pleasure and relaxation and has certain medicinal properties that can help reduce stress, pain and asthma symptoms, as well as being beneficial to Alzheimer's patients.  The reason it was made illegal initially was due to pressure from the oil industry and the media, who made profits from deforestation. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which created the name ‘marijuana’ to suppress its use.
9145	I believe the separation of church and state is intended to protect both institutions from government interference, rather than allowing them to benefit from special tax statuses. If a minister teaches the Bible, that is one thing, but Pastor Parsley, who has long flaunted his political views and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax-exempt status. Additionally, Parsley is a millionaire many times over, which raises questions about the fairness of his tax status.
9146	I believe the separation of church and state is constitutional law, which prevents the government from interfering with religious organizations and their assets. However, if a minister teaches the Bible, as is legal, or if a pastor like Rod Parsley, who has openly promoted political views and allowed candidates to speak from his pulpit, the church should lose its tax-exempt status. As Parsley is a millionaire many times over, this could have a financial impact on the church.
9147	I believe that the separation of church and state was intended to prevent the government from interfering in religious matters, but I believe that churches and other religious institutions should be subject to taxation, particularly if they have large amounts of wealth or financial resources. Parsley has used his influence as a pastor to promote political views and allow candidates to speak from his pulpit, which is a violation of the separation of church and state, and he should lose his tax-exempt status for this.
9148	I believe that the separation of church and state is more closely tied to the idea of tax exemption; in some cases, this allows religious organizations to operate without paying taxes. However, if ministers begin to teach political views or allow candidates to speak from the pulpit, this could potentially violate the separation of church and state and thus may lead to the loss of tax exemption.
9149	I believe that the separation of church and state is designed to prevent the interference of either institution in the business of the other. While this allows for churches to teach religious curriculums, it should draw a line when it comes to pastors using their platform to regularly advocate for political views and allow candidates to speak from their pulpits. Pastors should lose their tax-exempt status if they are earning significant income from their congregations.
9150	The federal government has limited authority to regulate clothing beyond areas under direct federal control.  States and localities have the power to create laws in these areas, which typically reflect the local community’s sense of decency and civility.  Over the last 30 years, these laws have become more lenient, allowing people to express themselves in a wider variety of styles.  Similarly, society has become more accepting of differences in dress, allowing people to be realistic in their choices.
9151	The federal government has limited power to make laws concerning clothing, as this is largely a matter reserved for the states and localities. In recent decades, these laws have become less strict, allowing people to express themselves more freely. People should be aware that some dress codes may not be accepted warmly, especially when they involve expressions of sexuality.
9152	The federal government does not have the authority to make laws regarding clothing except in certain designated areas under federal control. Generally, such laws reflect the local perceptions of decency and civility. In recent decades, these laws have become more lenient, allowing individuals to express themselves more freely. As society becomes more accepting of different styles, individuals should be realistic in their own choice of attire, taking into consideration social mores.
9153	The federal government has limited power to regulate clothing laws, as these are more effectively addressed at the state and local level. Over the last few decades, these laws have become more lenient, allowing people to express themselves through their clothing. People should be realistic in how they dress, as clothing choices can often reflect sexual mores, which society has come to accept.
9154	The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control.  States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions.  Over the last few decades, these laws have become more lenient, reflecting a greater degree of societal acceptance of different dress styles.  While society has become more accepting of different styles, there is still a degree of decency and civility that needs to be observed.  Moreover, the freedom to express one’s style should be respected, as individuals have different preferences.  Thus, in such cases, society has become more tolerant of such differences.  In short, the laws have evolved to accommodate such changes in society.  It is important to note that the interpretation of what is decent and respectful varies depending on the location.
9155	I understand the UK government's funding of the British royal family is a point of contention for some; however, it is a longstanding tradition that dates back centuries. While it may be different from other systems of government, it remains a point of pride for many Britons.
9156	I don't know. As an American, I find it curious that the UK continues to allocate funds to the Royal Family. Granted, I might be more inclined to agree if I were English, but since I'm not, I personally do not feel that the money is being utilized efficiently. Although the US elects its Presidents, the UK seems to have a different system of choosing its Monarchs, which could lead to increased costs for the government.
9157	I understand the UK’s monarchy is an important part of the country’s culture and identity, and I recognize that Americans may not share this view. However, as an American, I find it funny that the UK spends so much money on this institution, especially when tax money is concerned.
9158	I understand the monarchy is an important part of British culture and history, but I think the UK could use its money more effectively. As an American, I find this interesting from an outsider's perspective, but I wouldn't be as amused if I were English. Granted, I wouldn't be so amused if my tax dollars went to these things instead, but at least our government is elected.
9159	I don't know. While I recognize the need for some level of monarchy in the UK, it does seem expensive to maintain and run, and I personally would not be as amused if I were English. Granted, I wouldn't be so amused if I were American, but since I'm not-    .  Despite this, I believe that these are decisions that should be made by individual countries, and I understand that this is a matter of tradition for the UK.
9160	Well, the problem is that, absent a conviction, the judge cannot be removed from office except by a supermajority vote of the House. This is because judicial ethics rules may be violated, or the judge has simply created an appearance of impropriety, which is not enough grounds for removal from office. Generally, removal is only allowed if the judge has committed an illegal act, which is typically at a felony level.
9161	Yes, judges can be removed if they are found to have engaged in misconduct, which can include violations of judicial ethics rules. It is generally required that the misconduct rises to the level of a criminal offense, or at least a felony, before a judge can be removed from office. Additionally, a judge may be removed if their conduct creates the appearance of impropriety, even if no actual legal violation has taken place.
9162	Well, the problem is -- until there is proof that the judge has violated a judicial ethical rule, or committed a crime, she cannot be removed from office absent a supermajority vote of the House.
9163	The removal of a judge from office is a very serious action and should only occur in cases where there is proof of serious misconduct. Generally, judges can only be removed if they have broken a law or violated a judicial ethical rule, and that rule-breaking must be of a serious enough nature to warrant it. Additionally, removing a judge from office can only occur if there is proof of actual misconduct, and not simply the appearance of it.
9164	Well, the problem is -- until there is definitive evidence that a judge has violated a judicial ethics rule or committed a crime, removing a judge from office requires more than just a suspicion; it usually requires some level of criminal activity or ethics violations that rises to the level of a felony.
9165	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this: while the death penalty provides some form of justice to the families of the victims, what alternatives could be used instead? We should use these alternatives more often, as it could offer a chance of rehabilitation for the criminals.
9166	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this - how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising its usage more?
9167	It is understandable why some societies choose to impose the death penalty as an act of retribution, however, this does not make it morally right. Alternatives such as life imprisonment and rehabilitation are more humane options as it allows the offender to live while removing the threat of further violence. Advertising the use of these alternatives more can help to bring a more humane approach to criminal justice.
9168	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality, the death penalty does not necessarily deter crime more effectively than alternative sentences such as life imprisonment. We should focus more on rehabilitation and providing support to victims and their families instead of vengeful punishments. This could help us to provide more effective alternatives in place of the death penalty.
9169	It is only to assuage our own guilt that the accused is given a last meal. In reality, we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to taking life in retribution. We need to consider alternative methods of punishment that are more humane, such as psychological and social rehabilitation programs. These programs provide offenders with a chance to redeem themselves and become productive members of society, giving them a sense of purpose and hope, rather than taking their lives.
9170	It seems that the fruits of theology are often limited in comparison to philosophy, as theology is essentially philosophy with a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims. This makes it less likely to reach true conclusions. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociology and politics provide better grounds for discussion of religions.
9171	It seems that the fruits of theology are relatively scarce and few compared to the work of philosophers, who have more often than not been able to reach true conclusions through reason and analysis. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociology, and politics are more appropriate grounds for religion to be discussed. Theology is not as likely to yield significant insights as philosophy because of its initial assumptions.
9172	It seems that the fruits of theology are often less numerous than those of philosophy, due to its reliance on specific assumptions about God/s and Scripture. In addition, it is less probable that theological conclusions are true than those of philosophy, as per the principle of parsimony. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociology and politics are better grounds to discuss religion.
9173	It seems that the fruits of theology are more limited than those of philosophy. This is because theology typically assumes a particular conception of God/s and scriptural claims, which can make it less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy, according to the principle of parsimony. Theology provides an interesting lens through which to study culture, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociology and politics, but it is less likely to yield fruitful insights in these areas than philosophy.
9174	It seems that the fruits of theology are often limited when compared to philosophy, as theology requires an initial assumption of God/s and scriptural claims which can lead to less reliable conclusions than philosophy. Although theology has the potential to explore aspects such as culture, history and politics, this is less likely to result in true conclusions.
9175	I believe that being able to experience a sense of life and happiness in a simulation could be beneficial and worth investing in, even though there is the risk of not knowing when it would end.
9176	I believe it would be preferable to live in a simulation than to face the uncertainty of the real world. While it is possible to experience happiness in a simulation, it could also be possible in the real world, providing an opportunity for a fulfilling life.
9177	I believe it is preferable to spend a lifetime of happiness and comfort in a simulation, rather than to face the uncertainty of the real world. While the simulated environment may offer challenges, it could also offer the chance to lead a happy life that would be more difficult to achieve in the real world.
9178	I prefer the idea of being able to experience a more normal life within the simulation, as this would offer the potential for a happy existence which would be more difficult to achieve in the real world. Additionally, the simulation would offer a more controlled environment in which to explore and experience things, giving me more freedom to shape my experiences according to my own preferences.
9179	I believe it is possible to find joy and fulfilment in a simulation, even if it means accepting the risk of a difficult life. In the simulation, I could have the opportunity to experience a happy life that would be much harder to achieve in the real world.
9180	I am a heterosexual male and I can find no reason to condemn homosexuality as immoral. While I believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the Bible is true and thus biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, I do not believe that naturalness is a definitive criteria for moral evaluation. Vaccines are not natural, yet they are not considered immoral. Computers are unnatural, yet they are not considered immoral. If something is immoral, there should be clear evidence in reality to back this up; the justification should not be limited to naturalness alone. However, the reasoning for homosexual acts being wrong seems to be based on naturalness, which does not convince me.
9181	I believe that, while we can find reasons to support our moral beliefs, it is difficult to definitively state that something is immoral without observed consequences in reality. Homosexual acts do not seem to have observable consequences in reality, so it is difficult to definitively state that they are immoral.  The justification for homosexual acts being wrong seems to rely on the assumption that what is natural is good, which may not be true. Vaccines are not natural, but they are not necessarily seen as immoral as well.
9182	I am a heterosexual male and while I believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the Bible is true. Thus, I do not find homosexual acts to be immoral as there is no definitive proof that they are inherently wrong. I believe that justifications for homosexual acts being wrong rely heavily on personal opinion and assumptions that homosexuality is inherently immoral, rather than reality. Additionally, I do not believe that acts should be judged as immoral simply because they go against natural order, as vaccines are not considered immoral and computers are unnatural but not considered immoral.
9183	I am a heterosexual male and I do not believe that homosexual acts are immoral. Though I believe in God and am aware of the teachings of the Bible, I do not believe that everything in the Bible is true. Additionally, I believe that morality should be based on observable reality and that the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should go beyond this. However, the reasoning that homosexuality is inherently immoral does not seem logical to me. Vaccines are not natural and are not seen as immoral; likewise, computers are not natural and are not seen as immoral.
9184	I believe that it is possible to define moral standards outside of religious teachings, as homosexual acts can impact the wellbeing of those involved and society as a whole. Natural or unnatural does not necessarily dictate morality. Homosexuality is an inherently immoral act due to the potential impact it can have on an individual and their partners, as well as the social environment.
9185	On /r/parenting, people talk about co-sleeping in a positive light. While co-sleeping may be convenient in the short term, it can lead to safety risks for the baby, such as being rolled or fell out of the bed, which can damage the baby’s head and neck. Additionally, having a baby in the bed can strain the parents’ relationship and make it harder for the child to stay away from the parents’ bed. Basinets can be a better option as they are small enough to fit nearly anywhere and can easily be attached to the bed. Co-sleeping should always be discouraged and never encouraged.
9186	On /r/parenting, people discuss co-sleeping in a positive light. While co-sleeping can provide some benefits, such as increased convenience when breastfeeding, it can also be dangerous, as babies can be rolled over in the bed or fall out of it, disrupting intimacy between parents. Co-sleeping with a baby for a long period of time can also be harder to establish later on, further diminishing the couple’s intimacy. Basinets can be a great alternative, as they are small enough to fit nearly anywhere and can be attached to the bed for convenience. It is best to always discourage co-sleeping and avoid it whenever possible.
9187	On /r/parenting, many parents discuss the benefits of co-sleeping, which can offer a number of advantages, such as making feeding easier and being less of an inconvenience. However, co-sleeping can be dangerous, as babies can be rolled or fall out of the bed, which can damage their health and the parent's intimacy. It is important to be mindful of these risks. Bassinets are lightweight and can be moved to make feeding easier. They are also relatively small and can fit nearly anywhere.
9188	On /r/parenting, people discuss the benefits of co-sleeping, which can pose safety risks for babies. Babies can be rolled or fall out of beds, which can impact the parents’ intimacy. It is harder to stop this later on and may damage the baby’s bedding arrangements. Basinets can be a hassle as they take up space. However, some brands have basinets that can be attached to the bed, which can be portable and accommodate the baby. As far as safety goes, co-sleeping should be discouraged and not recommended.
9189	On /r/parenting, people often discuss the benefits of cosleeping, which can present safety risks. Babies can be rolled onto or fall out of the bed, which can damage the parent’s intimacy. Additionally, making it harder to stop the habit later can further damage the relationship. Cribs or bassinets offer some protection and are more compact. Cribs can be moved around and bassinets can be attached to the bed.
9190	I believe businesses should have the right to decide whether or not to give discounts to senior citizens, armed forces and students, depending on their own policies. There are many professions that make a valuable contribution to our society, but these discounts should not be enforced by law.
9191	I believe businesses should have the right to decide whether or not to give discounts to senior citizens, armed forces and veterans, as they see fit. However, in my opinion, such discounts should not be mandatory by law.
9192	I believe businesses should have the right to decide whether or not to give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces, as each business is different and should have the freedom to set its own policies. While these groups already receive benefits, giving discounts is not always the best way to show appreciation.
9193	I believe businesses should have the right to determine their own pricing policies, and customers should have the choice to decide whether or not they want to purchase a product or service. However, I believe there are many other initiatives that businesses can take to show appreciation to senior citizens and armed forces, such as special discounts, free offers, or loyalty programs.
9194	I believe businesses should have the right to set their own policies on discounts, however I believe it should be up to the individual businesses whether or not they choose to offer discounts to seniors, armed forces, and veterans, as I do not believe there should be a blanket policy of offering discounts across the board.
9195	After the Russian annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, the US and EU have imposed economic sanctions on Russia. This could hinder Europe's economy more in the long term, and may help Russia as Putin aims to rein in corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires by limiting their use of tax havens. While Putin has ordered his government officials to close offshore accounts and buy Russian-made cars, Europe may still be a market for Russia due to its dependence on gas imports.
9196	Russia relies heavily on its ability to purchase goods and services from other countries, particularly from Europe, as it does not have the same economic clout as other countries. This relationship enables Russia to access vital resources and allows both sides to benefit in the short term.   The US and EU have imposed sanctions which could have a longer term detrimental effect on the Russian economy if left unchecked. It remains to be seen if these sanctions will be effective in the long run in preventing these practices. In addition, the Russian government may use the sanctions as an opportunity to rein in corrupt officials and stop tax avoidance.
9197	Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his government officials to close offshore accounts and buy Russian-made cars as a way to curb corruption and raise revenues. Additionally, wealthy Russians utilize other countries to avoid Russian taxes. The US and EU have imposed sanctions to business and individuals, which will negatively affect Europe in the short term, but in the long run, this could help Russia.
9198	Russia is reliant on imported energy, as it lacks the infrastructure to exploit its own reserves of oil and natural gas. Russia is thus particularly vulnerable to changes in energy prices, as it relies on external suppliers for a large portion of its energy needs. Given this, the imposition of sanctions or other restrictions by the US and EU could have a significant negative impact on the Russian economy in the long run.
9199	President Vladimir Putin ordered all government officials to close offshore accounts and buy Russian-made cars in 2018 in order to crack down on corruption and tax avoidance among the wealthy. The US and EU have imposed sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in response. This may have a long-term negative effect on Europe’s economy, although Russia stands to benefit in the long run. Additionally, Putin may use these sanctions to clamp down on tax avoidance.
9200	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it can provide an opportunity for us to study extremism more closely. We can learn from these people and understand what makes them tick to make better choices. We can also take better care of ourselves and keep an eye out for people who seem to win over nations, races and society and cause them to do horrific things.
9201	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it highlights the danger of extremism and allows us to learn more about it. We can use this knowledge to ensure that such events are avoided in the future. Studying extremism can give us insights on how to better protect ourselves and our communities from such occurrences.
9202	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it highlights the power of extremism and how it can lead to radical change.  If we study extremism more, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things. So, yes, studying extremism can give us a better understanding of what causes these events and can help us prevent them in the future.
9203	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I do not believe this; they will be in our history books due to their ability to gain enough attention and make an impact. I am not saying that I agree with them, but their existence has caused extremism to become more prominent in our society. We should study extremism more in order to learn why these groups believe they are right and why their views cause society to take drastic actions. Understanding these motivations can help us take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society.
9204	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore WBC they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it makes us more aware and aware citizens can protect themselves and their communities from extremism. We should study extremism more to learn what makes these people tick and gain insights from it. This can help us learn how to better protect ourselves and our communities.
9205	I understand your view that age is less of an issue when it comes to intimacy, as it can be more of a personal and emotional connection than the age of the participants. However, it is important to remember that sexting, especially with minors, can open up numerous risks and potential issues which is why laws and regulations are in place to protect minors in such situations.
9206	I understand your point that age can be a factor in intimacy, however, sexting is a crime and could potentially lead to serious consequences for the student. Regardless of age, it is always important to consider the legal and emotional implications of these types of situations.
9207	I believe that the age of consent should be decided on a case-by-case basis, and that it is wrong to criminalize consensual sexual activity between adults. While I understand the concern of the other students, I do not believe that the age of sexual consent is an issue of paramount importance.
9208	I think that it is important to be aware of the risks associated with teen sexting, especially when it involves minors. While it is understandable that age may not be a factor in terms of intimacy, it is still necessary to take steps to protect young people from potential harm.
9209	My dad is 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother older than my mom as well. While I understand the issue of underage sexting is a concern, I believe age can be a factor in relationships and it is important to consider the potential impact on the child involved.
9210	I have read the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972, and subsequent books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and George Mitchell that have discussed the limits of capitalism. I recently learned that Mitchell, the inventor of fracking, held conferences in Houston, Tex which highlighted these issues. This surprised me, as I cannot imagine oil executives openly criticizing the capitalist system which gave them so much wealth. Today, I do not hear our leaders in business, media, and corporations discussing the fundamental limitations of our system, instead focusing on solutions such as technology and economics.
9211	I recently learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, held a series of conferences in Houston, Tex focused on the “Limits to Growth” study. This was surprising, as these conferences challenged the very system which provided him with so much wealth. Today, I do not hear our leaders discussing the fundamental issues of our system of capitalism, apart from ideas to solve inequality and climate change through technology and a sound understanding of economics. While these solutions are all within the framework of globalized capitalism, our leaders are much less open-minded to possible solutions to global problems.
9212	I recently learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, held a series of conferences in Houston, Tex focused on the “Limits to Growth” study. I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.    Today, I don't hear our leaders in business, media, or heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism. At best, I hear people talking about solving inequality and climate change through innovations in technology and a sound understanding of economics. All of these solutions are well within the framework of globalized capitalism.    Our leaders today are much less open-minded about possible solutions to global problems.
9213	I recently learned that George Mitchell, the inventor of fracking, held conferences in Houston, Tex focusing on the "Limits to Growth" study. This was surprising to me, as Mitchell was critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. Although I have heard discussion of solutions to global problems, I have not heard our leaders in business, media, or corporate heads speak about the fundamental problems of our capitalist system.
9214	I have read the 1972 "Limits to Growth" study, as well as books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others, which discuss the problems and limits of capitalism. Recently, I learned that George Mitchell, the inventor of fracking, held a series of conferences in Houston, Tex where he was critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. Such open criticism of the system is surprising, but it suggests that capitalism's limits and problems are not being discussed in the same way as they were in the 1970s. In contrast to this, I believe that our current leaders in business, media and corporations are focused more on solving economic and environmental issues within the framework of globalized capitalism. Although these solutions are feasible, the mindsets of our leaders are not as open to new ideas as they were in the past.
9215	Firstly, I believe that sour cream is best sold in a squeezable container, as this is usually the most practical option for users. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt. However, in most cases it is more convenient to have a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. This makes it easier to apply with the palm of your hand.
9216	Firstly, I believe that sour cream should be mainly available in a squeezable container, similar to ketchup or mustard. This is because it is usually used as a topping, making it much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm. Furthermore, this type of container would provide more convenience and would be more practical for everyday use.
9217	Firstly, I agree that sour cream is typically used in recipes, but in some instances it is more convenient to have a type of container similar to ketchup or mustard, such as a squeeze container. This would be more practical for application due to the ease of use from the palm of your hand.  However, in most cases it is used as a topping, which could be easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm.
9218	First off, I understand that sour cream is available in a squeezable container. This type of container is more convenient and user-friendly, similar to condiments such as ketchup and mustard. Most of the time, sour cream is used as a topping, making it easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm. Thus, a squeeze type of container would be the ideal choice for consumers most of the time.
9219	First off, I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container. My view is that this should be the *standard* type of container. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt.   Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easy to scoop with a spoon. However, in most cases, sour cream is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm.
9220	I believe that the current driving age of 16 is too low and that teenagers at this age are a danger on the road. Teenagers are known to be more prone to impulsive decisions, as evidenced by the increase in texting-related accidents, which indicates that they are unable to consistently operate a car safely. Raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from engaging in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illicit drug use. Keeping teens off the roads will make the environment safer for both children and adults alike.
9221	I believe that raising the driving age could have a positive effect on road safety. Teenagers are more likely to take risks and use vehicles while under the influence, which makes them a danger on the roads. Allowing them to gain more experience and maturity could reduce these risks.
9222	I believe that raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. This could have a positive impact on both teenagers and adults using the roads.
9223	I believe that raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. This could help reduce the number of car accidents, making the roads safer for all users.
9224	I believe that raising the driving age could make driving safer overall and would also help discourage teenagers from participating in risky activities such as underage drinking and illicit drug use. It is important to note that teenagers are still learning to drive and are less experienced behind the wheel when compared to adults, making them more vulnerable to accidents.
9225	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, People with God" has led me to write this CMV.  I believe that gun violence is a complex issue that is shaped by a combination of cultural, economic, social, and political factors. There is no single cause and gun violence can be prevented by addressing these underlying factors. I believe that access to firearms should be regulated by laws and that appropriate gun control measures should be in place.
9226	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God" has led me to write this CMV. I believe that these statements are subjective and open to interpretation, as gun violence is ultimately a choice made by people, regardless of their religious beliefs. While gun violence can be triggered by a variety of factors, in my opinion, gun violence is ultimately a choice made by people, regardless of their religious beliefs.
9227	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God" has led me to write this CMV.  I believe that both Religion and God can play a role in the acts of killing people; I do not believe that Religion is a mitigating factor in these acts, as people are capable of committing violence regardless of their beliefs. In this way, I believe both Religion and God can act as an influencing factor in these acts, highlighting that people with God and people without God can both be involved in killings.
9228	I believe that guns are capable of taking lives, regardless of whether or not people have access to them. Ultimately, it is people who have the capacity to cause death and injury. However, it is true that certain religious and spiritual beliefs can play a role in shaping people's attitudes towards guns and gun control.
9229	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV.  I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel that both sides of this argument have valid points, and it is up to individuals to decide how they view the relationship between guns and religion.  I personally believe that the relationship between guns and religion is complex and dependent on context and culture. While guns may increase the likelihood of death in some situations, this does not necessarily mean that guns are the primary cause of death. In some cases, guns may be more of an accelerator of death rather than the cause.
9230	I believe that if you can earn a good income from a job that you are not completely satisfied with, it gives you more flexibility to be able to afford and do what you want in life compared to a job that gives you higher job satisfaction, but with less money.
9231	I believe that if you can make a good income from a job that you are not satisfied with, it can make your time off much better since you have the money to afford and do what you want in life compared to enjoying your job more but not having the things you want in life. This is a personal choice and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me.
9232	I believe that if you make a good income from a job that you are not fully satisfied with, you have more opportunities to be able to afford and experience what you want in life compared to having higher job satisfaction. It is a personal choice that I consider important when making a career decision.
9233	I believe that if one makes a good salary from a job that one is not entirely satisfied with, the time off will be even better, as one can now afford and do more of what one wants in life. In my opinion, job satisfaction is crucial, and money gives one more opportunities to do so.
9234	I believe that if one is able to make a good income from a job that they are not fully satisfied with, they can use that money to make up for a lack of job satisfaction. This allows them to enjoy their time off more, as compared to having a job that has higher job satisfaction but not having the lifestyle they want.
9235	I recently read interviews with Jimmy Page where he expressed his dislike of mp3s. However, I believe that if he were presented with higher bitrates, such as 256 kbps or higher, he would be unable to tell the difference. Led Zeppelin's upcoming deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.   Personally, I still prefer higher audio quality for home listening, although I understand the convenience of mp3s. I tend to prefer original gold CDs and LPs, but I believe my ears may not be able to tell the difference. I do love plugging my iPod into my vehicle's audio system, though.
9236	Recently, there have been several interviews with Jimmy Page regarding Led Zeppelin's deluxe reissues. In them, Page has stated that the reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks. Personally, I believe that any difference in sound quality is minor at 256 kbps bitrate or higher, as I feel the same way about mp3s in general.
9237	I've been pondering this recently. In /r/ledzeppelin, there have been several recent interviews with Jimmy Page, who never turns down an opportunity to slag off mp3s. But I think if you sat him down with proper high-quality controls, he would struggle to hear any difference at 256kbps or higher. The reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.   I personally still don't like mp3s, although I am a bit of a snob about it. I prefer my audiophile setup, but I know my ears probably cannot detect any difference. I do love connecting an iPod full of mp3s to my fancy vehicle audio system, though.
9238	Lately I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag off mp3's. But I'm willing to bet if you sat him down with proper controlled listening, he would fail to notice any difference at bitrates of 256 kbps or higher. He's mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.   That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I prefer my audiophile set up, but I think my ears probably can't detect any real difference. And certainly I greatly enjoy plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
9239	I recently read some interviews with Jimmy Page, who rarely turns down a chance to talk about his dislike of MP3s. However, I think if he was sat down and presented with high-quality audio, he would struggle to hear a difference, even at 256kbps or higher. In addition, the new Led Zeppelin reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks. While I still prefer physical formats, I am a bit of a snob about it, and I think my ears probably cannot detect a difference. However, I do love connecting my iPod to my car's audio system.
9240	I believe that the current system of governance has its flaws, as corruption, bankruptcy, and poor economic performance are common issues across many countries. Such issues are often solved in assemblies where politicians come together to discuss solutions. However, these solutions are often ineffective.   Technocracy movement of the early 1900s proposed replacing the current political system with one where engineers and scientists, specialized in each area, would run the areas they are responsible for, which would allow for more efficient decision-making.
9241	I believe our current political systems have had their effectiveness challenged by instances of corruption, bankruptcy and poor economic conditions. Solutions proposed at assemblies often fail to be implemented adequately. Technocracy movement proposed replacing politicians with specialists in each field, such as education being run by someone educated in that field. I believe this could be a better approach than the current system.
9242	I believe our current political system has its limitations. While politicians may come up with solutions to solve economic and social issues, these solutions often fail to be implemented effectively. Technocracy movement, which emerged in the early 1900s, proposed to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they would run, such as education being run by someone connected to the field with a majority of education-related experience.
9243	I believe our political systems have not been running as effectively as they could. Technocracy movements of the early 1900s proposed that politicians be replaced by professionals specialized in each area, such as education being run by someone with a background in education. This could be an effective way to ensure solutions are implemented properly.
9244	I believe our current political system has not been running as effectively as it should. Technocracy movement, which was established in the early 1900s, suggested that politicians should be replaced by engineers and scientists with specialized knowledge in their respective fields, which could be implemented through policies.
9245	I believe that men and women face different challenges in our culture, and that misogyny is a pervasive issue. However, I also believe that mental health plays a role in these shootings, and the two are not mutually exclusive. We need to acknowledge both elements of the problem.
9246	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that mental health was a factor in the shooting, and that Elliot Rodger's sexism was a contributing factor. It is important to recognize and address the issues of gender inequality and sexism in our culture, but it should not overshadow the need to address mental health more thoroughly.
9247	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health was a bigger issue and looked at more closely, the shooting potentially could have been prevented. While there is a definite misogyny in our culture, there are many other issues that contribute to this type of violence, and we should not overlook these.
9248	I think there are certain issues that affect women more than men, such as sexual harassment and a lack of equal pay, which are a result of gender-based discrimination. However, I recognize that mental health is an important factor in the Elliot Rodger shooting, and that there are underlying issues of misogyny in our culture which contribute to these tragedies. I think it is important to recognize both elements of the situation, and consider how we can address these issues in order to prevent future shootings.
9249	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that Elliot Rodger being mentally ill was a contributing factor. Mental health is an important issue that needs to be addressed and while gender inequality and sexism do play a role in our culture, it could have been prevented if mental health was given more attention.
9250	Hi everyone,  After watching the news recently, it is true that the cracks in the EU have become more apparent due to the EU’s foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states are monitoring the elections has me wondering if the EU could ever be a unified body.  I think that the dissolution of the EU could be very damaging for the region, as nationalism could lead to increased animosity between countries and potentially even another war. It is a concern that I have, and I would like to learn more about this situation. I welcome your thoughts and opinions on the matter.
9251	Hi everyone,  I understand the concern that Europe may become increasingly more divided, especially due to the rise of nationalist parties. While I cannot definitively say what would happen if the EU were to dissolve, I believe that this could potentially lead to another war. It is important to keep a unified front between countries in order to prevent this from happening.   Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this matter.
9252	Hi everyone,   After watching the news recently, it seems that the cracks in the EU are beginning to widen due to the Russian foreign policy issues. Hearing that some member states are monitoring the elections made me wonder if the EU could ever become more unified.   Dissolving the EU would likely be detrimental to the region due to the rise of nationalistic parties, which could lead to further hostility between countries and the potential of another war.   I understand that this could be an overly pessimistic view, so I would be interested to hear more about this subject.
9253	Hi everyone,  Recently, I have become increasingly concerned about the state of the EU due to the impact of foreign policy decisions made by member states, especially in regards to Russia. While I recognize the need for greater national sovereignty in some states, I am concerned about the potential for increased animosity between countries, which could ultimately lead to conflict. I believe this would be damaging for the region and further complicate any unity efforts within the EU.  Thus, I believe strong cooperation and unity between countries is essential for long-term stability and growth.  I would be interested to hear more opinions and perspectives on this matter.  Thank you.
9254	Hi everyone,  After watching the news recently, it is evident that the cracks in the EU are beginning to widen due to divergent foreign policy decisions made by some member states. Hearing that some states are closely monitoring election results makes me wonder if the EU could ever become a unified body.  The dissolution of the EU would be highly detrimental to the region due to the rising tide of nationalism and the subsequent animosity between countries. This could potentially lead to another war, an outcome I believe we should strive to avoid.  I am open to learning more about this subject, so please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences.
9255	It is understandable that the gods of early civilizations were largely unknown to the people of the Mesopotamian region, as their beliefs and religions developed over time. It is possible that the gods of these early civilizations were more regional in nature, instead of being widely worshipped as the gods of later religions. While it is impossible to know for certain why the gods of these early civilizations were largely unknown, it is possible that their beliefs and religions developed over time and that these gods were more regional in nature. Additionally, it is possible that the gods of these civilizations were more regional in nature, instead of being widely worshipped as the gods of later religions.
9256	Why did the gods of today's religions not make themselves known to people in the Mesopotamian region earlier than they did? We cannot be sure why the gods chose to make themselves known to people at particular points in time, but it is possible that they had a plan in mind that allowed their beliefs to spread over time. If a god is all-powerful, then it is possible that he allowed people to explore their beliefs in this way. Moreover, we cannot definitively say that the gods were not concerned with this; it is possible that they had a plan in place to allow their faiths to spread over time.
9257	It is possible that the gods of early Mesopotamian cultures were gradually revealed to these people over time, or that these gods were simply seen as emanations of a greater force that was eventually expressed in the religious systems of the region. We cannot know for certain why these gods were not widely known earlier, but it is possible that their existence was gradually revealed over time. We can also speculate that the gods of these cultures were seen as expressions of a greater power, which eventually evolved into the religious systems of the region. This offers a possible explanation as to why these gods were not widely known earlier.
9258	Why did the gods of early Mesopotamian civilizations not become known to people earlier than they did? Would the Christian God, who is all-knowing, not have made himself known earlier than he did? If he is all-knowing, this raises the question of why he allowed humanity to wonder so long before worshiping “true gods”. Does this not provide cause to doubt all religions? We cannot be sure that the earliest gods were not angry about this.
9259	Why did the gods of today's religions not make themselves known to people in the Mesopotamian region earlier than they did? It is possible that these gods chose to remain hidden for reasons unknown to us, although this raises questions about their nature. In addition, we cannot be sure if other gods were truly present in the area or if these gods were the only ones worshipped. This leaves us with a degree of uncertainty which suggests that it is possible that gods existed and chose to remain silent.   As to why these gods chose to do so, we cannot say for certain. This raises questions about their nature and whether they were truly present in the area or if these gods were the only ones worshipped. This leaves us with a degree of uncertainty which suggests that it is possible that gods existed and chose to remain silent.  116242935798219745
9260	Communication is a key factor in preventing many of the world's problems, such as car accidents, fights, and terrorism. For example, in car accidents, it is often the case that drivers are unaware of what other drivers are doing, leading to a lack of communication that can result in disaster. Similarly, in fights, two people may not communicate the rules of a game properly, leading to disputes. Additionally, in terrorism, governments often do not listen to people's concerns, exacerbating the situation. Thus, communication is vital to prevent such occurrences.
9261	Communication is a factor in many problems, as it can lead to misunderstandings and negative outcomes. For instance, car accidents occur due to drivers not being aware of what other drivers are doing, which can cause issues when there is a lack of communication regarding traffic rules and regulations. Similarly, gossip can arise when two people have not communicated properly about an activity or game. In addition, terrorist attacks can occur when governments do not take the concerns of their people into consideration in the first place.
9262	Communication issues can be a factor in many problems, such as car accidents, where drivers are unaware of each other's actions; conflicts arise due to lack of communication between two people playing a game. In some cases, terrorist activities can occur if the government does not listen to the concerns of its people in the first place.
9263	Communication is often the cause of many issues, as it can lead to misunderstandings, accidents, gossip, and even violent conflicts. For example, when drivers on the road do not communicate well, it can lead to car accidents.
9264	Communication issues can often be the root cause of many problems. For example, car accidents can occur due to drivers being unaware of what other drivers are doing or issues turning into gossip when the rules of a game are not communicated properly. Additionally, terrorist attacks often happen when governments do not listen to the concerns of their people in the first place. There are many other examples that could be cited.
9265	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up as it makes them content with their current situation, which reduces the motivation to strive for better opportunities. This reduces their ability to contribute to the economy and can impact business growth. Furthermore, welfare requires taxation which reduces people's spending power and limits the availability of resources.
9266	Welfare can reduce incentives for lower-income individuals to move up as it makes them content with their current situation. This can hinder upward mobility as it reduces the incentive to spend, which in turn affects business growth. Welfare also increases taxes, which can limit individual spending power. However, welfare is necessary to provide aid to those in need, and its funding is usually taken from taxes.  Welfare can be beneficial in providing assistance to those who require it, though this can mean higher costs for taxpayers.
9267	Welfare can limit the incentive for individuals in the lower class to move up as it makes them more comfortable staying where they are. This can limit their earning potential and limit business growth. Welfare can also increase taxes, leading to lower spending and reduce economic opportunities. It can also require people to pay for services that other people need, such as healthcare and education. This can be seen as a negative aspect of welfare.
9268	Welfare can reduce incentives for people to move up if it makes them content with their current situation, as it limits their ability to spend and limits business growth. Welfare can also increase taxes, which can reduce people's purchasing power. Additionally, welfare programs require funding from taxpayers, which can force people to pay for services used by others. This can be seen as a potential issue for some individuals. However, welfare programs can provide necessary support for those in need and can help create a more equitable society.
9269	Welfare can be beneficial for those in need, as it helps to provide essential services and resources to those who would otherwise be unable to access them. This can help individuals to move up the social ladder, as it ensures that people are able to meet their basic needs and provides a sense of security. However, it is true that welfare can limit people's incentive to move up if it does not lead to them feeling content where they are, as this could reduce their motivation to do so. Additionally, it is true that welfare can lead to higher taxes and spending, which can reduce business growth.
9270	Lowering the drinking age to 16 could help reduce drinking-related issues and deaths later on in life as it allows for more controlled access to alcohol in these societies. This can have positive long-term effects on public health and may generate additional revenue from alcohol sales for the government through taxation.
9271	The legal drinking age should be 16. There is strong anecdotal evidence from countries where casual drinking is socially accepted at younger ages, such as France, which shows lower rates of drinking-related diseases and deaths. Integrating casual drinking into a society can significantly reduce binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. This can also increase tax revenue and fund programs to aid those recovering from alcoholism.
9272	The minimum legal drinking age should be lowered from 21 to 18 in order to reduce binge drinking and boost tax revenue. In countries where drinking is permitted at a younger age, this has been shown to have a positive impact on alcohol-related health issues and increase revenue. This could help improve access to recovery programs for people with alcoholism.
9273	The legal drinking age should be 16, as this can help to reduce alcohol-related diseases and deaths. By introducing casual drinking at an earlier age, this can help to reduce binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. Additionally, this could increase alcohol sales and thus tax revenue, which can help fund programs to assist those with alcoholism.
9274	Allowing underage drinking could reduce rates of drinking-related diseases and deaths, as it has in countries such as France, where it is more accepted at an earlier age. This could reduce binge drinking when a person reaches 18, 19 or 21. Additionally, the extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs to help those suffering from alcoholism.
9275	I have always been partial to yellow, as it reminds me of the sun and brings a feeling of warmth and happiness. However, red has grown on me over time; I find it much more striking and exciting. It is also associated with fire trucks, letter boxes and other objects, which makes me more aware of its presence.
9276	I never really liked red as a color when I was younger, as it reminded me of blood or death. However, I have grown to appreciate it more over time. Yellow is more associated with sunshine and cheerfulness for me.
9277	I've always been fond of red - it reminds me of the colour of blood and other bodily fluids as a child, but as I've gotten older I've grown to appreciate it more. It's certainly a striking colour that stands out and makes an impact, and it's associated with fire engines, letter boxes and makeup, all of which make me think of its ability to make an statement.
9278	I've always found red to be an energising and striking colour; it brings a sense of excitement and intensity to my surroundings. As I got older, I began to appreciate red more and more; it's now a colour I'm drawn to as it gives me a sense of energy and vibrancy. Yellow is a bright and cheery colour that makes me think of the sun, which brings a sense of positivity and joy to me. Red is my favourite of the three colours.
9279	I'm guessing you said that you started to appreciate red more as you got older? I never really liked yellow as a color, but as I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate it more. It reminds me of the sun and other warm elements, which makes me happy. In comparison, red stands out more and has a stronger impact on me. It is also associated with fire trucks, letter boxes, and makeup such as red lipstick and rosy cheeks, which is quite appealing.
9280	I understand that teenage sexual activity can have consequences, such as teenage pregnancy, STDs and physical damage. However, I believe it is important for individuals to consider the long-term implications of their decisions and to consider the effects of such activities on their bodies and minds. Waiting until the age of 16 is still relatively young, and can lead to greater risks.
9281	This argument is very close to me at the moment. A 17-year-old friend of mine had unprotected sex with a minor, even though they are aware that this is breaking the law. They seem to have no qualms with this decision, which could lead to issues such as teenage pregnancy, STDs, and potential physical damage. I personally feel that this is not the best route to take, as it can cause long-term mental and physical harm. Sex before marriage is a personal choice, but having sex at such a young age can have lasting consequences.
9282	This argument is close to me at the moment, as a 17-year-old has had unprotected sex with a minor, even though they are aware that this is breaking the law.  While sex at a young age can lead to physical and mental health issues, it is important to be aware of the potential consequences of sexual activity before the age of 16. It is better to be safe and wait until the legal age of 16, in order to be better prepared for the future.
9283	This argument is very close to me at the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor of whom is not even totally “developed” yet.  While I believe it is important for teens to be aware of the risks of engaging in sexual activity at a young age, I personally feel that waiting until the age of 16 could help reduce these risks, as it can prevent issues such as teenage pregnancy, STDs and permanent physical damage.
9284	This argument is very close to me at the moment. A former friend of mine, who is 17 years old, has had unprotected sex with a minor whom is not even totally "developed" yet. He is aware that this is against the law, but still proud of it.  I personally believe that it is not right to engage in sexual activity at such a young age. This could lead to issues such as teen pregnancy, STDs and even long-term physical and mental damage.
9285	As humans, we have the freedom to choose what we want to do, but this does not mean that we have complete freedom. Our decisions can impact our relationship with God and the world around us. God provides a remedy in Jesus Christ, who can offer salvation and hope.
9286	Adam had the choice to do either good or evil, and he chose evil, which had consequences and created an evil world. Although man has the freedom to make choices, Adam's choices had long-reaching effects that affect us today. God, however, provided a remedy in Jesus Christ, which allows us to have a restored relationship with God if we repent and place our trust in Him.
9287	Although man has the freedom to choose what he wants to do, his choices can have lasting consequences that impact his relationship with God and the world around him. However, God provides a remedy in Jesus Christ, who offers salvation through repentance and faith in Him.
9288	Man has the right to make choices, but these choices can have consequences. Adam chose to do evil, which caused harm to his relationship with God and contributed to an evil world. Even so, Jesus Christ is a remedy for the evil. By repenting and having faith in Him, there is hope for a better future.
9289	While man has the freedom to choose what he wants to do, his choices can have lasting consequences that impact his relationship with God and the world. Jesus Christ is the solution to the evil in the world. Repent and have faith in Him for salvation.
9290	Humans are classified as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. However, humans possess certain traits that differentiate them from other animals. These traits include greater intelligence, which sets humans apart from other animals. Though humans are different from other animals, this does not necessarily make us 'better' than other species.
9291	Humans are part of the animal kingdom, and we share many of the same characteristics with other animals. It is difficult to define exactly what separates humans from animals, since the distinction is based largely on our level of intelligence. However, it is clear that greater intelligence does enable humans to be classified as non-animals.
9292	Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. Humans possess greater intelligence than most animals, which gives us unique capabilities that set us apart from the animal world. While intelligence is a significant factor that differentiates us from other animals, it is not the only factor; there are other qualities, such as our ability to communicate and use tools, that also contribute to our distinct nature.
9293	Humans are classified as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. However, humans possess certain traits such as language and tool use which sets them apart from other animals. This distinct difference between humans and animals does not necessarily imply that humans are superior or inferior to animals.
9294	Humans are classified as Homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. However, humans have greater cognitive abilities compared to other animals, which distinguishes them from other animals. Intelligence can be used as an indicator of this distinction.
9295	In the UK, the government's surveillance of citizens has led to a lack of trust between the government and the people. This has been highlighted by Westminster Council's decision to remove Banksy's artwork, which was seen by many as a way of engaging and poignant. The council should recognise this piece as a gift that should be embraced.
9296	The UK government's Big Brother program has raised concerns that people do not feel confident that their data is being properly protected by the government. This has led Westminster Council to take away some aspects of the urban environment that people enjoy and want to keep, such as graffiti. However, Banksy's artwork has given these spaces a new sense of meaning and identity, which should be recognised and embraced.
9297	This piece highlights the increasing restrictions on personal privacy in the UK, as councils in London have taken away the sense of freedom and control people have over their own data. Banksy's work has transformed what was once a boring and ugly wall into something engaging and meaningful, but the council has decided to remove it. Westminster Council should recognise and protect art that is a gift to be enjoyed by all.
9298	This piece highlights the increasing trend of surveillance in the UK, where people are increasingly wary of the government’s presence and activity. This has been further compounded by the Westminster Council’s decision to remove the artwork, which has become increasingly popular and a source of interest amongst the public. Banksy is a celebrated artist in his own right, and the Council should recognise and preserve this artwork.
9299	This piece by Banksy highlights the tension between people's desire for privacy and the government's surveillance of citizens. In the UK, this surveillance is further compounded by Westminster Council's removal of a piece of art that people generally enjoy and want to keep. This has led to a breakdown in trust between the government and people, which Banksy has highlighted with his art. The council should recognise and celebrate this artwork as a gift that should be embraced.
9300	In recent years, surveys have shown that many children view Christmas as a day to receive gifts, instead of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. This should be remembered as the birthday of Jesus, where Santa Claus has become the symbol of Christmas for many children. This has resulted in the celebration of Christmas being diluted, thereby changing its meaning for many people.
9301	In the current status quo, children are receiving the wrong impression of Christmas. According to a survey, most children see Christmas as a day to receive gifts, rather than the birth of Jesus Christ. This takes away from the meaning of Christmas and puts more emphasis on Santa Claus as the holiday symbol, which is not right.
9302	In recent years, surveys have shown that many children now associate Christmas more with gifts than with the birth of Jesus Christ. This is not the traditional meaning of Christmas, and it can make it harder for children to understand the true significance of the day. Additionally, the introduction of Santa Claus as a symbol of Christmas has caused many children and even adults to focus more attention on him than on Jesus. This changes the original meaning of Christmas, and that is not right.
9303	In the current system, Christmas has become largely associated with gifts and Santa Claus in the minds of children and adults, detracting from the original meaning of Jesus’ birth. This can lead to a disruption of the traditional significance of the holiday, thereby reducing the emphasis on the birth of Jesus. Additionally, the introduction of Santa Claus as a symbol of Christmas has shifted attention away from Jesus in the same way that this has happened with birthdays, thereby changing the original meaning of the holiday.
9304	In the current status quo, children are now experiencing the wrong meaning of Christmas as surveys show that majority of children see Christmas as primarily a gift-giving day or the day where parents give them whatever they want, which should clearly not be the case. The meaning of Christmas is supposed to be the birth of Jesus Christ, but Santa Claus has become the main symbol for many children and adults alike, which changes the emphasis away from Jesus. This is similar to what happens in status quo birthday parties, where the attention shifts to a different person instead of the birthday child.
9305	I agree that legalizing performance-enhancing drugs is a bad idea. One of the main reasons these drugs are illegal is to protect player safety; the younger players may not realize the consequences of using them. Furthermore, these athletes serve as role models for younger children, and allowing this could encourage the use of steroids for younger children, which could lead to greater use among non-professional players. If these drugs were made legal, it could cause the use of these drugs to become more common among both professional and amateur players.
9306	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is not a good idea. These drugs can have harmful effects on the body and it is in the best interest of the government to protect player's health, particularly since they are still young and these effects may only be seen later in life. Furthermore, allowing players to take these drugs could encourage younger children to use them, as they may look up to the professional athletes and feel like they need to take them in order to compete. This could lead to a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in both professional and non-professional athletes. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, this could potentially occur.
9307	I agree that legalizing performance-enhancing drugs is not a wise idea. One of the main reasons these drugs are illegal is to protect athlete's health; the government wants to keep athletes safe, as they are still developing and could be more susceptible to the harm these drugs can cause. Additionally, these athletes are seen as role models by many children; if these drugs were legalized, it could encourage use by younger athletes, who may think they need to take them to compete. This could lead to an increase in the use of these drugs, not just in professional athletes, but in nonprofessional athletes as well.
9308	I agree that legalizing performance-enhancing drugs is not advisable as it can have serious long-term health effects. One of the main reasons these drugs are illegal is to protect the athletes’ health, as young athletes may not be aware of the consequences. Further, these drugs can influence younger athletes to use them, which could lead to an increase in usage among both professional and non-professional athletes. Legalizing these drugs may cause an increase in usage in both cases.
9309	I agree that legalizing performance-enhancing drugs is not ideal. One of the main reasons they are illegal is to protect player health, as these substances can cause harm. It is in the government's interest to ensure players' wellbeing, especially given the young age of many of these athletes. Additionally, these substances may encourage use among younger children, which could be concerning. Legalization of these drugs could cause an increase in their use among both professional and non-professional athletes.
9310	An economic superpower in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan enabled Germany to have the upper hand in the war in terms of military strength and technology. Japan was mainly confined to fighting in jungles and thus was unable to make much of an impact.
9311	An economic superpower in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan were some of Germany's advantages over Japan. Additionally, Germany had greater military capabilities and economic strength than Japan due to its stronger industrial base.
9312	An economic powerhouse in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave tactics, and much more powerful than Japan. Germany was fighting in Jungles in smaller bands, but their navy was stopped quickly. Japan’s surrender in the Pacific War came two years earlier, but Germany’s economic power and military capabilities gave them the upper hand.
9313	Germany had a much more powerful economy, military and scientific advancements than Japan, which enabled them to win the war. Japan was forced to fight in jungles, which limited their power. Furthermore, Germany's loyalty to its emperor meant that it was able to resist longer.
9314	An economic superpower in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan enabled Germany to gain the upper hand compared to Japan during World War II. Germany had a more advanced economic power worldwide before the war, as well as new scientific and military advancements.
9315	I believe that Quebec City's heritage should be celebrated in a more meaningful way than simply a sculpture. The city's history is important and should be recognized, but doing so through a sculpture may not be the best way. Other options, such as building a statue to commemorate the event, should be considered.
9316	Quebec City's history is an important part of Canada's heritage, and in my opinion, it should be celebrated and preserved. The Government of Canada is in the process of creating an art installation to commemorate the events that occurred there and showcase its history, which seems like a suitable way of doing so.  However, French nationalists are objecting to this primarily on the basis of nationality, which I feel is unfair.
9317	I think Quebec City's ‘birthday’ should be celebrated by building a statue commemorating the city’s history, as this is an important way of honoring it. This is particularly true because the city’s history is closely linked to that of Canada. Moreover, General Wolfe's statue on the plains of Abraham could be an interesting option.
9318	Quebec City has seen considerable growth and development over its history, and the government is currently planning various projects to mark the occasion, including the installation of public art. While this is a worthwhile way to honor the city's history, some French nationalists are opposed to it due to the artist's nationality, even though there is no issue of artistic merit. To me, this seems unnecessarily restrictive and limits the opportunity to celebrate the city's heritage.
9319	The French nationalists are objecting to his performance based on his nationality, which they would have a valid point of view about since Quebec City's history is concerned. From my perspective, I believe a better way to celebrate Quebec City's 'birthday' would be to build a giant statue of the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham.
9320	Ohhhh.... This is a close call! Queen has some remarkable songs that will continue to be popular for many years to come, such as We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions. However, I think Pearl Jam has a wider range of musical themes and ideas. In the end, I believe Queen is the better band.
9321	Ohhhh.... this is tough, very tough. Queen's music has a wider range of themes and ideas and is more memorable, so I think they take it. However, Pearl Jam's songs are musically very strong.
9322	Ohhhh.... This is a tough call. I think Queen takes it, as their music will live on longer and their range of themes and ideas is wider. However, Pearl Jam is still very good musically.
9323	Oh, this is difficult! I think Queen takes it, as their anthems (We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions) will live on long after the band is forgotten, as well as the wider range of themes and ideas their music explores.
9324	Ohhhh.... this is tough, very tough. I think Queen takes it, because their anthems (We will Rock You, We are the Champions...) will live on long after the band is forgotten. Also, their music explores a wider range of themes. Pearl Jam is good, but Queen is better.
9325	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. This ensures that tax dollars are used to benefit the people in the area as much as possible. For example, a family of four might check “education” to allocate funds towards their children’s education, whereas they may uncheck “health care” if they did not need medical services. This system provides more efficiency in tax money prioritization.
9326	Through taxation, the government can determine which areas are most important to the people. By choosing where the tax dollars go, the government can ensure that scarce resources are allocated to what is relevant to the people, as local needs and preferences change. This way, education would be a higher priority for a family of four, as it directly affects their children. If the family never got sick, they could choose to lower health care funding. This would make the system more efficient.
9327	By choosing where our tax dollars go, the government can determine which organizations and programs are most important to a certain area. This ensures that money goes towards things that are relevant to the people, rather than something that may not be of concern to the community. For example, if a family of four checks “education,” their money can go towards their children’s education, which can be prioritized over health care.
9328	Through taxation, the government has the power to decide where the funds go, allowing it to ensure that money is distributed where it is most needed. This ensures that money is channelled to things that are relevant to the local community, providing greater efficiency. For example, a family of four may choose “education” so their money can go towards their children’s education, while “health care” would only receive funding if necessary.
9329	By giving local governments the power to decide where tax money is spent, they can ensure that funds are targeted to provisions that are relevant to the local population. For example, if a family of four chose “education,” their money would go towards their children’s education, which directly affects them. Conversely, if they never got sick, they would choose “health care.” This system would make sure money is prioritized.
9330	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people regard as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore and one of the most engrossing stories ever to be found in a video game. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. Brilliantly designed and executed, and still regarded by many as the best game in the series. All honors need to go to Ocarina of Time.
9331	Ocarina of Time is the better game of the two, despite being a great complement to Majora's Mask. Many consider it the best game in the series and it offers an excellent 3D experience. It established the Zelda series in the modern era, making it highly memorable for me. Overall, it's still regarded as the best game in the series by many.
9332	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT. We're talking about what many consider the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, providing players with a massive world to explore and one of the most engrossing stories found in a video game. It was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. In my opinion, OoT is still regarded by many as the best game in the series.
9333	Ocarina of Time is often regarded as the best game in the Zelda series, as it brought the franchise into the 3D realm and provided an immense world to explore and an engrossing story. It was a great game that hooked many players, making it a favorite for many. MM was a great complement to OoT but OoT stands out for many people. Both games were enjoyable and the story of OoT is highly praised by fans.
9334	Ocarina of Time is the clear winner when compared to Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play and provided an engaging experience, but Ocarina of Time stands out as the best game in the series. It introduced the Zelda series to the 3D realm and gave us a large world to explore with an incredibly engaging story. It was my first game addiction and the game that got me into the series.
9335	I am inclined to believe that, if I were to develop early-onset Alzheimer’s or similar mental decline, I would consider ending my life. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am; if I were to forget who I am, forget what I believe, and forget what I am, then I would choose to end my life at that point.
9336	I am willing to consider the possibility of ending my life if I were to suffer from early onset Alzheimer’s or a similar mental decline. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. If I forget who I am, forget what I am, and what I believe, then I would choose to end my life at that point.
9337	I would be inclined to end my life in this situation, as I believe my sense of self is largely defined by my memory and ability to recognize reality. Losing my grip on reality and forgetting who I am could be seen as an erosion of my identity, which I would not wish to experience.
9338	I would consider ending my life if I were experiencing early onset Alzheimer's or a similar mental decline. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. If I forget who I am, forget what I am, and forget what I believe, then I cease being me.
9339	I am inclined to believe that everyone has the right to make decisions about their own life, including whether or not to end it. However, if I were diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's or a similar form of mental decline, I would reconsider ending my life. As memory and consciousness are the defining aspects of our identity, I would not want to risk forgetting who I am, forgetting my beliefs and values.
9340	The salary of a teacher in Wisconsin includes both the teacher's salary and benefits, which totals $75,000 per year. This figure is higher than the average $53,000 salary of a teacher in the US, including benefits, yet spending on teacher salaries and benefits exceeds $4.5 billion nationally. This is a significant amount of money that is difficult to receive when considering the current situation of the US public school system.   The US has lower test scores than other countries, in part due to the inability to fire mediocre teachers. I would recommend watching the documentary ‘Waiting for Superman’ to gain more insight into the issues of the US school system.
9341	The average salary of a teacher in Wisconsin is approximately $75,000, including benefits, which is among the highest in the nation. In comparison, the average salary of a teacher in the US is $53,000, not including benefits, which is below the national average.   Overall, Wisconsin is among the top states for teacher salaries and benefits. However, there is room for improvement in teacher pay and benefits, especially when compared to other countries.   In addition, the US spends approximately $1.6 billion on teacher salaries and benefits. This is a considerable amount of money, particularly when compared to other countries.
9342	In the United States, teachers are an essential part of our educational system and play a crucial role in shaping the minds of our children. In comparison to other professions, teacher salaries are often lower, even when benefits are included. However, in some states, teacher salaries, including benefits, exceed $75,000.  The US spends approximately $4.5 billion on teacher salaries and $1.6 billion on their benefits. While this is a large sum of money, these expenditures often fail to improve the quality of teachers or incentivize teachers to stay at the same school.  I believe that teacher salaries should be based on performance and that performance-based raises should be offered to teachers in order to incentivize them to stay at the same school.
9343	The average salary of a teacher in the US is around $53,000 a year, including benefits, which is higher than the national average salary of $32,000. In Wisconsin, salaries plus benefits reach $75,000, while $1.6 billion is spent on teacher benefits nationally.  I believe that this is a considerable amount of money for teachers to receive, especially since teacher performance should be the main factor in determining salaries and raises, rather than the number of years they have worked at the school.  I recommend watching the documentary ‘Waiting for Superman’ as it illuminates the many shortcomings of our public school system. The US should have higher test scores, yet we fall short due to our average teachers that are hard to dismiss.
9344	The average salary of a teacher (including benefits) in Wisconsin is $75,000, while $1.6 billion is spent on teacher salaries and benefits. Although this is a significant amount of money, it may not be enough to attract and retain quality teachers.  I believe that teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, rather than years of service. Further monitoring of teacher performance is necessary to ensure the quality of our public school system. Watching the documentary 'Waiting for Superman' can provide a better understanding of our current system.
9345	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?  Just because one man's theories have stood the test of time does not necessarily mean they are true. Alternate theories have been proposed, but have largely been dismissed by the scientific community due to a lack of evidence.  It is still possible that future experiments could prove these theories correct.  Ultimately, the correct nature of the universe is still unknown.
9346	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct?  Just because one man has a feeling all matter warps space-time doesn't make it true!  Theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the "ultimate sagging mattress" that is often alluded to.  This theory is fairly ridiculous and there are a number of things specifically wrong with it. 1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions. 2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes. 3. It can never work with quantum physics. 4. Black holes; not even light can escape.  So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum? 5. Other theories are far more logical, but have been gunned down by conservative physicists.
9347	Einstein's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by the curvature of space-time, which means that gravity is affected by the distribution of matter and energy in the universe. This idea is supported by experimental evidence and is the basis of modern gravitational theory. While other theories have been proposed, relativity provides the best explanation for gravity to date.
9348	Although Albert Einstein's theory of relativity provides a powerful explanation of the relationship between space and time, other theories have been proposed that offer alternative explanations of the universe. One such theory is the theory of "assisted gravitation," proposed by Chinese physicist Chang-Lin Tien. This theory states that gravity is not a force that acts between objects, but rather an effect caused by the curvature of space-time, similar to that proposed by Einstein. This theory has greater explanatory power when it comes to general relativity and provides a better understanding of the behavior of light and gravitational fields.
9349	The concept that all matter sucks space-time is an interesting one, but there are several challenges to this theory. Mathematically, it is flawed due to assumptions and thought experiments create paradoxes. Additionally, it fails to work with quantum physics as the velocity of light is the universal constant, which poses questions as to why something can change its velocity through a vacuum. Other theories are more logical, but have been dismissed by conservative physicists.
9350	The U.S. has a large navy, with a total of 366 military ships in commission. Given the size and diversity of the maritime environment, a few extra ships would be necessary to ensure effective protection of trade routes and countries in the area. With hundreds of ships regularly passing through these dangerous waters, ships with aid-providing intentions are able to do so safely. Allowing trade routes to be safe and secure is of utmost importance.
9351	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World, with a total of 366 military ships in commission. We also have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are at risk of pirate attacks. Unfortunately, this area of sea covers thousands of nautical miles and these ships cannot effectively protect the trade routes and nearby countries.  We cannot rely on a few ships alone, but it would be beneficial to deploy more vessels in order to ensure security. Allowing trade routes to remain dangerous and hostile is not an ideal option; we must take proactive measures to protect these areas.
9352	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world, with a total of 366 military ships in commission. While there are four ships in the region that are vulnerable to pirate attacks, this area of sea covers thousands of nautical miles. This poses a challenge for the ability of the U.S. navy to effectively protect these trade routes and nearby countries. U.S. navy forces should be deployed to better secure the region, as many other countries have done to protect their sea routes.
9353	The U.S. has a strong navy and is home to several hundred military vessels, including four in the area which are vulnerable to pirate attacks. While these ships are able to patrol the thousands of nautical miles of ocean, the limited presence of vessels makes it difficult to provide effective protection of the trade routes and nearby countries. To provide better security, the U.S. should deploy more ships to the area.
9354	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world, with a total of 366 military ships in commission. These ships provide security and aid to countries around the world, including in the area that is vulnerable to piracy attacks. While these ships are sufficient to protect the more heavily trafficked areas, the ships are limited in their ability to protect the more distant areas, making it more difficult to protect the trade routes and countries in these areas.  Although the U.S. Navy has the capability to deploy more ships to these areas, it may be more effective to increase the presence of existing ships in order to provide more secure trade routes and provide aid to these countries.
9355	There is a possibility of a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran in the near future due to tensions between the West and Muslim nations. Iran is a likely target for such an event given the hostility between the two regions. Even though Israel's interests may differ from ours, they are still intertwined and we may get involved in a conflict there. The neoconservatives have been pushing for such policies for some time now and their predictions have not panned out yet. It is possible that we may see war or conflict in the region.
9356	It is possible that a conflict may erupt between the U.S. and Iran in the near future. Iran and other Arab/Muslim countries strongly oppose the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. This could lead to a major conflict between these nations. Israel's interests and America's interests are linked, and Israel could be pulled into a conflict even without direct U.S. involvement. The Neoconservatives have been pushing for these changes for some time now, and the consequences could be severe. We must prepare ourselves for the possibility of war or conflict in the region.
9357	There is a chance that the U.S. and Iran could have a conflict in the near future, due to their shared interest in the Middle East. Iran is a target for many Arab/Muslim nations, who have supported terrorist organizations. Furthermore, the interests of the U.S. and Israel are linked, making it likely that any conflict involving Israel would also involve the U.S. It is likely that tensions between the two countries will continue to rise.
9358	There is a possibility of a conflict between the US and Iran in the near future. This is due to the shared hostility between the US and many Arab/Muslim nations, as well as the support for terrorist organizations. Moreover, if an attack occurs within the next few years, Iran is likely to be the main target. Although Israel and the US have distinct interests, any conflict involving Israel could involve the US as well. The neoconservatives have been pushing for these types of conflicts, which could cause significant damage.
9359	I disagree that there is no possibility of a conflict between the US and Iran in the near future. Iran and many other Arab/Muslim nations have been actively supporting terrorist organizations and have expressed animosity towards the West. This could potentially lead to a conflict between the two countries. Also, Israel’s interests are directly linked to America’s, meaning that Israel could be dragged into a conflict without America actually being at war with Iran. The neoconservatives have been pushing for this for some time, and while I hope it does not happen, it seems probable that a conflict between the two countries will occur.
9360	My husband and I agree that this was the best sushi we have ever tasted. We have both had a lot of sushi in the past, and we feel that this restaurant offers excellent quality sushi at an excellent price. We highly recommend it.
9361	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we have ever had. We both felt that it was superior to other sushi we have tried in the past, including sushi from more expensive places in Las Vegas and elsewhere. We highly recommend it.
9362	My husband and I both agreed that this sushi was the best we have ever had. We have both had a lot of sushi in our time, and we both really enjoyed this restaurant's offerings. It was well worth the cost of the rental car to drive there from Vegas.
9363	My husband and I both agreed that this sushi was some of the best we have ever had. We both agreed that it was superior to other sushi we have tried in Vegas and elsewhere. We highly recommend it.
9364	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we have ever tried. We both felt that the flavors and quality of the fish were superior to any other sushi we have had before.
9365	I own a business on Craig Street and yesterday was the day I had to eat there. The people were not very friendly, and there was a lack of eye contact. Although the food was okay, I would not recommend it as it was not fit to feed my pet.
9366	I often have to eat along Craig Street, as I sometimes find the food there to be satisfactory. Yesterday was one of those days. The people were not very friendly, and there was a lack of warmth in their interactions. The food was not up to the standard I would expect for my pet. While I would recommend skipping some places on the street, I would not do so for others.
9367	I often eat at businesses on Craig Street, as I sometimes have to do. Yesterday was one of those days. The people were not very friendly, and they didn't make eye contact. The food, however, was not up to the standard I would expect for my dog; it was not fit for human consumption. In short, I would recommend avoiding this place.
9368	I own a business off of Craig Street, and I was there yesterday. The people were very unfriendly, and they barely made eye contact. The food was not up to the standards I expect for my dog, and I would not recommend it. It was truly disappointing.
9369	I own a business on Craig Street, and yesterday was the first time I ate there. While the food was fine, I was disappointed by the lack of customer service; the employees did not make eye contact and seemed uninterested in their customers. Furthermore, the food was not up to the standards I have come to expect from the street.
9370	I had a great dining experience at the restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and had it vegan. It was amazing; the fresh basil was the highlight of the dish and it was cooked perfectly. The staff were also great; Alyssa, my server, was attentive and familiar with the vegan options, which made it an even better experience. I will definitely come back when I next visit. It is always pleasant when the staff are as helpful and kind as the food is delicious.
9371	I had a great experience at the restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro, which was amazing - the fresh basil was the highlight of the dish. The staff were attentive and helpful, which made for a better dining experience. I especially enjoyed having a server who was familiar with the vegan options, which was refreshing. All in all, it was an A+ experience.
9372	I had a wonderful dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off, which was delicious. The fresh basil was the highlight of the dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and that, combined with the fresh herbs, makes it 5 stars.   However, the best part of my experience was the staff. Alyssa was attentive, knowledgeable about the vegan options and always made sure our drinks were filled. I would definitely request her if I come back in the future. All in all, it was a great experience that was made even better by the staff's helpfulness and kindness.
9373	I had an excellent dining experience at the restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro without cheese and it was very good; the fresh basil was the highlight of the dish. Additionally, the pasta was cooked perfectly. The service was excellent and I particularly appreciated the server's familiarity with the vegan options.   It was definitely a positive experience overall. I would come back again and ask for the same server, who was very attentive, helpful and kind. The atmosphere and food quality made it a 5-star experience for me.
9374	I had a great experience at this restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and, since I left the cheese off, it was vegan. The fresh basil was the highlight and the pasta was perfect, making it a 5-star meal.  However, the best part was the food itself - the service was great as well. Our server, Alyssa, was attentive and familiar with the vegan options, which made it even better. I will return when I come back to the restaurant for sure. It is always pleasant when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious.
9375	The food was average in terms of taste and quantity, and the price was too high. We had the Sashimi which was OK, as well as a beef noodle dish which was very mediocre, with huge lumps of tofu. We had two wines and two beers, which came to $174 including tip. It was not worth the visit.
9376	The food at the restaurant was pricey, but the Sashimi was OK. The beef noodle dish was below average in size and quality, and the wine was too expensive. We were six people in total and the bill, including tip, was $174. We would recommend caution if eating there.
9377	We had dinner at the restaurant and were a bit disappointed with the food and the service. The Sashimi was acceptable, but the beef noodle dish was small and lacked flavor. The wine was overpriced, with a glass costing $13. We spent $174 including tip, and it was not worth the price. We would not recommend this restaurant.
9378	The food was okay, but not worth the price tag. We had the Sashimi which was satisfactory, as well as a beef noodle dish which was smaller than expected, with large chunks of tofu. Wine was $13 per glass.   Overall, we spent $174 including tip, which was slightly more than expected. We would recommend caution when eating there.
9379	The food was relatively expensive and took a long time to arrive. The chairs had wheels, which was strange. The Sashimi was okay, but not worth the price tag. Also, I had a beef noodle dish which was small in quantity but had huge lumps of tofu. The wine was $13 a glass. 6 of us ate there, and the total bill was $174, including tip. It was not worth the visit.
9380	I generally don't go to Jack in the Box often, but I've never had a particularly bad experience at their locations. However, the service I encountered at the last two locations was unacceptable. It took 15 minutes to get a single jumbo Jack at the last location, which was not busy, and management failed to acknowledge my presence during my order.   5 Guys continues to be my preferred option due to the quicker service and better experience I have had there. They seem to take less time than Jack in the Box and are a walk-in establishment. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees to ensure better customer experience.
9381	I have been to Jack in the Box a few times in the past, but I have never had a particularly positive experience. Service has been slower than expected, and I have often experienced long wait times.   On my most recent visit, however, the wait time was much longer than I expected; it took me over 15 minutes to get a jumbo Jack, even though the restaurant was not busy. I am reluctant to return in the future due to this experience.
9382	I have had positive experiences with Jack in the Box in the past, however the service at the locations I have visited has been unsatisfactory. On both occasions, it has taken longer to receive my order than other restaurants in the area, which has been concerning. I will be more inclined to visit Jack in the Box again if the service is improved.
9383	I don't go to Jack in the Box too often, but I have never had a particularly negative experience. However, the service has been lacking during my last two visits.   I have often found that the service is slower than expected, with the last two instances taking longer than expected. It took 15 minutes on my last visit and there were only a few customers.  Management should consider an overhaul of their employees' performance in order to provide better service. 5 Guys offers a better experience and is a walk-in burger place, so I will continue to give my business to them.
9384	I tend to visit Jack in the Box less frequently than other restaurants as I have rarely had a bad experience with them. However, the service at the locations I have visited has been lacking, and I have noticed a decline in the quality of service over time. I have twice encountered long wait times, with the last instance taking significantly longer than the previous one. It did not seem busy when I visited, yet the wait time was quite long. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees in order to provide a better experience for customers.
9385	I visited this restaurant with a friend and the atmosphere was pleasant. The menu was a bit confusing as it was in Italian, but the waiter was able to help us out. I got the seafood linguine as recommended by the waiter, which was a popular dish. The food arrived quickly, but the portion was small for the price. I was disappointed, as it was not worth the price tag.
9386	I enjoyed the atmosphere at this restaurant, however, the menu was a bit confusing as it was written in Italian. I asked the waiter for help and he recommended the seafood linguine, which was popular among customers. The food arrived quickly, but the portion was quite small for the price. Nevertheless, the noodles were flavorful and the cheese added at the top was a nice touch. Overall, I might return if the portion sizes were larger and the price was more reasonable.
9387	I visited La Sirena with my date, and overall I was quite pleased. The atmosphere was pleasant, and the wait staff were friendly and helpful.  The menu was a bit confusing as it was in Italian, but the waiter was able to recommend the popular seafood linguine. I enjoyed this dish, although it was quite small in portion size for the price.  The food took longer than expected to arrive, but we received free bread with olive oil which was acceptable. I was not as impressed with the food itself, and I left feeling a bit hungry after paying approximately $25.  Overall, I would not come back again due to the high price tag and small portion size.
9388	I went to Bistro Milano for dinner with my date. The atmosphere was nice and it seemed like a good spot for a date. The menu was a bit confusing because it was in Italian, but the waiter was helpful. I got the seafood linguine as recommended by the waiter, which was popular. The food took some time to arrive, but we were given complimentary bread with olive oil, which was hard and dry and I did not like it.  When the food arrived, we were somewhat disappointed with the portion size, as it was expensive for a small portion. We were able to finish the noodles quickly, although it was still tasty and flavorful. Overall, I would not come back again due to the high price tag and small portion size.
9389	The atmosphere was pleasant and the restaurant had a good vibe. I believe the menu was in Italian, which was a bit confusing, but the waiter was helpful. I got the seafood linguine, which was recommended by the waiter and it was quite popular.  The food arrived quickly, but it was a small portion for the price. We were quite disappointed, as it was too expensive for the size of the portion. However, the noodles were flavorful and enjoyable.
9390	I found the $5.99 China Buffet I tried to be more enjoyable than the buffet I visited. The food was flavorful and the selection was larger. The salads were fresh, the vegetables were present and the gravy was smooth. The roast beef was a better size and was cooked to a nice temperature. Additionally, it was priced reasonably for a Tuesday night.  I would recommend trying it over this buffet.
9391	I found the buffet at the restaurant to be unsatisfactory. The food was bland, the selection was limited, the salads were wilted, the gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was tiny, with only two paper-thin slices being provided for an excessive price of $19 on a Tuesday night. I prefer the $5.99 China Buffet I tried, which offers better value for money.
9392	I visited the All-You-Can-Eat buffet at the restaurant, expecting more variety and better quality food for the price. However, I was disappointed; the food was flavorless, the selection was small, the salads were wilted, and the “roast beef” was the size of a fist, with the slices they cut being two paper thin pieces. Additionally, I found it to be quite expensive, compared to other options at a similar price point. I would recommend trying China Buffet first, as I found that to be better value for money.
9393	I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I tried once.  The food was much better at the China Buffet, with a larger selection, fresh salads, vegetables and sauces, and better quality roast beef.  The price at the China Buffet was also more reasonable.  The food at the Tuesday buffet at this restaurant was a bit bland, and it was somewhat overpriced.  I would recommend the China Buffet over this restaurant, especially for the lower price.
9394	I was disappointed with the food and selection at the buffet. The salads were wilted, the vegetables were scarce, the gravy was congealed and the roast beef was small and dry. Furthermore, I found the price to be excessive, as I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I tried previously. Overall, I would recommend giving the buffet a miss and opting for Mandarin instead.
9395	I believe that school uniform can be beneficial in many ways. The gap between the rich and poor is an issue, as school uniform is cheaper than plain clothes. Although it may seem expensive, school uniform is still more cost effective. In addition, school uniforms can foster a sense of kinship and belonging among students. For me, school uniform was very convenient during my student days.
9396	I believe that school uniform can be beneficial in many ways. While the gap between the rich and poor can lead to unequal access to clothes, school uniforms can be cheaper than plain clothes. This is due to the fact that school uniforms enable students to feel a sense of kinship and belonging, which can be valuable during their student days. In my opinion, school uniform is convenient and easier to manage.
9397	I believe school uniform can be beneficial in many ways. There is a gap between rich and poor, so school uniform is better than wearing plain clothes. Although school uniform is expensive, it is cheaper than buying multiple sets of clothes. Teenagers also feel a sense of kinship and belonging. In my case, school uniform was convenient as I did not need to worry about my clothes during my student days.
9398	I believe that school uniforms have some benefits. Firstly, they are comfortable and easier to maintain in terms of cost. School uniforms are also beneficial for student’s social life as they provide a sense of belonging and kinship. Moreover, school uniforms are cheaper than purchasing regular clothes.
9399	I believe school uniforms are beneficial in many ways. Due to the economic gap, school uniforms are more affordable than regular clothes. Additionally, students are able to feel a sense of solidarity and belonging. From my experience, school uniforms are more convenient compared to regular clothing. During my student days, I did not have to worry about my clothes.
9400	Schools that enforce a uniform policy often restrict the clothes students are able to wear on certain days, with the result that students are essentially being denied their freedom of choice. This can be seen as a form of 'clothing control' that limits students' creativity.
9401	We talk about how schools can limit student creativity by implementing uniforms; uniforms often limit students' clothing choices, but give them a certain amount of freedom in what is acceptable. This is essentially turning the allowed clothing items into a uniform.
9402	Schools generally require students to wear uniforms, which can limit creativity and restrict students' choice of clothing. While some schools allow students to wear casual clothes on certain days, they often have strict guidelines in place as to what is considered acceptable. This practice effectively turns casual clothes into a de facto uniform.
9403	Schools often enforce uniform policies that limit students' ability to express themselves, as uniforms can restrict students' creativity. While schools may allow students to wear casual clothes on certain days, the rules regarding what is acceptable are strict, which restricts student's choices. This can be seen as an infringement on students' freedom to express themselves.
9404	Schools often limit students' creativity by enforcing uniforms, which can limit students' freedom of expression. While schools typically allow students to wear casual clothes on certain days, they often have strict guidelines in place regarding what is allowed. This can effectively turn casual clothing into a twisted version of its own uniform.
9405	When young, it is important to retain independence as this can help with the development of an individual's identity. While this should be encouraged, parents should still be involved in their children's lives to provide guidance and support.
9406	When they are young and exploring their independence, maintaining a degree of independence is important for a person’s development. This provides an opportunity for them to learn and find themselves, which is beneficial in the long run. Therefore, I vote for keeping some level of independence.
9407	When young, people should be allowed to make their own decisions and explore their independence, as this is important for their growth and development. I believe that independence should be fostered in this stage of life, rather than suppressed.
9408	When young, people should be able to express their independence as they explore who they are and find their identity. This is an important part of growing up, and I believe that this should be encouraged.
9409	I believe that younger adults should have the right to make their own decisions, as this helps them to gain independence and learn from their experiences. However, this should be balanced with the need for parents to provide guidance and support.
9410	I think school uniforms can be a hassle as it requires more effort to keep the uniform clean and can be an issue if a lot of layers need to be worn in the morning.
9411	I believe that school uniforms can be an inconvenience at times, as it requires extra effort to maintain the uniform and it can be cumbersome if more layers need to be worn in the morning.
9412	I think that school uniforms can be an inconvenience as it requires extra effort to clean and prepare them, as well as additional time if more layers need to be put on in the morning.
9413	I think school uniforms can be restrictive as they impose a specific dress code, which can be difficult to maintain and time-consuming, especially if there are multiple layers of clothing to wear in the morning.

9440	If my husband had committed a murder, I would find it difficult to turn him in, as my feelings would be stronger than the fear of having a murderer as a husband. However, I would not be able to look him in the eye or act as if nothing happened; I think my emotions would be stronger than anything.
9441	If my husband had committed a murder, I might choose to turn him in, even if my feelings were stronger.

9463	I believe India cannot replace developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, etc., due to its low literacy rate. Most of the population is illiterate, thus limiting India's potential to catch up with these countries.
9464	I believe India will face challenges in catching up with other developed countries such as the USA, UK and Japan, due to its low literacy rate.
9465	I believe it is better to have a father figure in your life than none at all, as children learn more from their father when growing up. Though it is ideal to have a father who is able to teach you as you grow up, this is not a necessity. Ultimately, it is better to have some fatherly guidance than none at all.
9466	I think it is better to have a father figure in your life who can teach you and guide you as you grow up, even if he is not completely ideal. Having some form of fatherly guidance is better than nothing at all.
9467	I think it's better to have a father who is able to provide guidance and instruction while you're growing up, as this can be helpful in learning and growing up. However, if a father is lousy, it can be less impactful having a father figure in your life.
9468	I think it's better to have a father figure in your life, even if that father is not as good as it could be. Learning from your father while growing up gives you more advantages than having no father at all, even though the father figure could be lousy. Having a father who is respectable is always better than having one who is lousy.
9469	Having a father is important for children to be able to learn and grow, so it is better to have a father figure in your life who is able to teach you something. Even though it may be better to have a father figure than not having one at all, it is still preferable to have a father who is able to be a positive influence in your life.
9470	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I cannot know how it feels to have a lousy father, but I have heard of friends who complain that their father is often drunk and fails to provide any support. They tell me they would feel the same if my father was like that, as at least then I would not know how it feels to be let down by a father.
9471	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I would not know how it feels to have a lousy father, but I have friends who tell me their fathers are often drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish their father was not around. If I had that experience with my father, I would feel the same way; at least then, you would not know what it feels like to be disappointed by a father.
9472	In my opinion, I think it is better to be fatherless rather than having an unsatisfactory relationship with your father. I have friends who tell me that their father is often drunk and does not help them. They occasionally tell me that they would feel the same way if their father was like that - although at least this way you would not know how it feels to be disappointed by a father.
9473	I believe that being fatherless is better than having an unsatisfactory relationship with one's father. From my perspective, it is difficult to know how that feels, but I have friends who tell me that their father is often drunk and does not help them. They sometimes tell me that they wish their father was not around. In this case, not having a father gives you a sense of what it is like to be dissatisfied with a parental relationship.
9474	Having no father at all can be difficult, but in some cases it may be better to not have a father, as one can be unsure of what it is like to have a disappointing father-father relationship. This could be the case if a father is physically or emotionally absent or abusive.

9480	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was implementing measures that were not approved of by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was implementing measures that were, in his opinion, indirectly harmful to the population, in order to protect the best interests of Singapore's population.
9481	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was implementing measures that were not approved of by Raffles.

9483	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was due to the fact that Farquhar was implementing measures that were not approved of by Raffles.

9495	It is possible that our world could be a giant hologram, as suggested by some theories. This suggests that our universe is simulated in some way, making it more likely that we live in a simulated universe.
9496	Our world may be a simulation, and such simulations have become increasingly common in our society as we use them to create virtual reality games and experiences. It is also possible that our world could be a giant hologram, as suggested in the article, since the concept of a holographic universe has been discussed in scientific literature.
9497	The theory that our world could be a giant hologram is an intriguing one, and while it is difficult to prove, it is possible that our world is a simulation. It is still possible that our universe is a simulation, but it is much less likely than a normal universe simulation.
9498	It is possible that our world could be a simulation; however, this is only speculation as we currently have no definitive evidence to support this idea.
9499	Given the current limitations of our understanding, it is possible that our world could be a simulation. It is not yet known whether we live in a simulated universe or a physical one.
9500	I used to be a Firefox user, as it provided better performance on my system with 2GBs of RAM, as I often run multiple programs at the same time. However, Firefox's memory usage proved to be higher than what I could justify for those advantages.

9530	Yes, if the woman obtains an abortion shortly after conception, it would be less likely to cause long-term health risks.
9531	Yes, if the woman chooses to abort the fetus shortly after conception, it would be less likely to cause any long-term health issues.
9532	It is generally recommended that abortions be performed as soon as possible after sexual assault, to minimize risks to the woman's physical and mental health. However, if the abortion is done soon after the assault, it is typically safe and effective.
9533	Yes, if a woman were to obtain an abortion soon after conception, it would likely be safe for her to do so, depending on the laws and regulations of her region.
9534	The abortion would be safer if performed soon after conception, as abortion procedures improve the chances of a successful and safe abortion.
9535	Now in my language, I will say What biologists call a "fetus", while it is still in the womb, is no more than a plant. However, plants provide oxygen to us as well as other animals.  Despite this, the fetus is still alive in the same way that animals are, although this is disputed.  Abortion is considered murder in some countries, as it interrupts the growth of the embryo.
9536	Now in my beloved language, I will say That is what we call an embryo, which is no more than a plant. Less, I would dare say that it churns resources, similar to plants, which provide oxygen for life.  Nobody disputes that life, but it cannot feel or think, which is what we commonly refer to as embryo.
9537	Now in my language, I will say  While a fetus may be considered alive, it is unable to feel or think, which is similar to what plants do provide oxygen as well as other animals.  It is true that plants give us oxygen, but this is a process that requires photosynthesis, which plants can do and animals cannot.  Therefore, while a fetus may be considered alive, it is still a parasite that is dependent on the mother’s body for survival.
9538	Now in my language, I will say It is true that a foetus is alive, but it is unable to sense or think, like a foetus. However, foetuses provide oxygen to the mother's body, like plants do for animals. This means that foetal life is still life, but it is much more limited than human life.  It is important to note that abortion is the deliberate killing of a foetus, which is a form of murder.
9539	Now in my beloved language, I will say That which we call a “baby”, an organism, is no more than a plant. Although plants give us oxygen, it still is life, but animals are able to feel and think more than plants.  Life is something that plants can do, but it is debatable whether it is life in the same way that animals can experience it.  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is able to survive on its own outside the womb.
9540	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"?  A woman has the right to make decisions about her body and her health, based on her own values, beliefs and needs. No one else should have that right taken away from her.
9541	It is important to consider both the potential impacts on the woman and any potential impacts on any future children of the relationship, as well as the woman's own wishes and needs, when making such a decision. Ultimately, it is the woman's decision that should be respected, rather than one chosen by another party.
9542	It is important to recognize that decisions about pregnancy and parenting are personal and private choices that should ultimately be made by the parents, rather than by the state or other external parties. While a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, it is important to remember that these decisions should not be made without the input and autonomy of both parents.
9543	It is important to recognize that the decision about abortion should be made by the woman herself, in consultation with her doctor and/or other support networks as she sees fit. Ultimately, it is the woman who has the right to make this decision, not the state or any third party.
9544	It is important to recognize that the decision of whether to continue a pregnancy or not is a woman's right and choice to make, ultimately. While it is understandable that couples and families may have different views and preferences on this issue, it is important that the choice is the woman's alone. No external party should have ultimate control over this decision.
9545	I believe that Pro-Choice is the better option for me since it gives me the option to choose Pro-Life if I want to. If I choose Pro-Life, I would have no choice.
9546	This is a fairly straightforward decision for me. I favor choice, as it gives me the option of choosing life. If I choose life, I have no choice in the matter.
9547	This is a relatively simple decision for me. I favor choice as I believe it gives me the right to choose both options. If I choose pro-life, I have no choice.
9548	I believe that pro-choice laws provide more freedom and choice, since I have the option to choose pro-life laws if I want. However, if I choose pro-life, I would have no choice.
9549	This is a personal choice for me. I favor choice, as I believe it allows me to make the best decision for myself. If I choose pro-life, I lose that option, which I believe is an important freedom.
9550	Science has established that evolution is the process through which life on Earth has formed over time. The Big Bang theory refers to the sudden expansion of matter and energy that is believed to have occurred over 13.8 billion years ago, which caused the universe to become increasingly hot and dense over time. As the universe has expanded and cooled, scientists believe that the conditions present in the early universe were necessary for the formation of galaxies, starting with hot, dense regions that eventually cooled off. These favorable conditions allowed for the formation of the first life-sustaining microorganisms, which eventually evolved into fish, amphibians, monkeys and eventually humans.
9551	Scientists believe that the Big Bang Theory is the origin of the universe, in which a hot, dense state gave rise to the cooler, more spread out universe we observe today. This indicates that the universe once had higher temperatures and denser matter, which allowed for the formation of galaxies and allowed Earth to become the ideal environment for life. Through evolution, life began with simple molecules which formed fish, then amphibians, followed by monkeys and finally humans.
9552	Science suggests that evolution is the process that drives the development of life, beginning with the formation of the universe. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began as a hot, dense space, which has since expanded and cooled over time. This allows scientists to infer that the universe once had higher temperatures and higher concentrations of matter. Earth was able to develop life due to its “Goldilocks” conditions, allowing for the formation of bacteria, which evolved into fish, amphibians, monkeys, and eventually humans.
9553	Science confirms that evolution is the origin of life. The Big Bang Theory is a cosmological model which postulates that the universe was initially formed from a hot, dense state. As the universe expands and cools, the galaxies move further and further away from each other, indicating that the universe must have been hotter and denser in the past. Earth was the ideal environment for life due to its "Goldilocks" conditions, which allowed bacteria to form, evolve into fish, amphibians, monkeys, and eventually humans.
9554	Science has established that evolution is the process through which life on Earth originated. The Big Bang theory proposes that the universe started as a hot, dense space, which has since expanded and cooled over time. This suggests that the universe had more energetic conditions in the past, allowing Earth to become the ideal environment for life. Marine life evolved from molecules, which eventually resulted in fish, amphibians, monkeys, and eventually humans.

9645	Given the vast amount of evidence from many different fields, such as history, archaeology, astronomy, biology, and many others, Christianity is shown to be largely consistent with the facts. While there are certain teachings written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator that appear to contradict each other, these are more explainable when considered from a larger perspective. Overall, Christianity is the more logical position of the two.
9646	Christianity conflicts with some forms of evidence, such as history, archaeology, and astronomy. It also contains several contradictions within its teachings, which were written down by an all-powerful and all-knowing creator. However, Atheism is the more logical position of the two, due to its lower reliance on faith.
9647	Christianity conflicts with some forms of evidence, such as historical, archaeological, and astronomical data, as well as some biological evidence. It also denies the possibility of a rational and impartial understanding of its teachings, which were written down by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe. It is true that Christianity's arguments are not as solid as one or two others, but atheism is the more reasonable belief of the two.
9648	Christianity conflicts with some forms of evidence, such as historical and archaeological evidence, as well as astronomical, biological, and other evidence. It also denies rational and impartial common sense. However, some of its teachings are consistent with those of other faiths, such as Islam, which are both written down by an all-powerful and all-knowing creator. As such, the arguments for Christianity are not as strong as those for atheism, which provides a more logical stance.
9649	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing creator of the universe, are open to interpretation and contain elements of truth. Atheism is not perfect, but it is a more logical position than Christianity.
9650	No one said science is perfect. That is the difference between science and religion. Science is open to the possibility that it does not have all the answers, while religion is too dogmatic to accept new facts and truths. Science is more open to finding the truth than religion, which is often dogmatic in its beliefs.
9651	No one ever said science is 100% accurate; that is the distinction between science and religion. Science is aware that it does not have all the answers, while religion is too rigid to recognize facts. Additionally, what truth stands for may differ depending on each person's beliefs.
9652	No one ever said science is 100% accurate. That's the difference between Science and Religion. Science recognizes that it does not have all the answers, while Religion is too dogmatic to accept new facts and perspectives. Even what Truth truly is remains a mystery that we can only explore and discover.
9653	No one said science is absolute. That is the difference between science and religion: science admits it does not have all the answers, while religion is more dogmatic and less willing to accept facts. Even what truth really stands for can vary depending on an individual's interpretation.
9654	No one ever said science is perfect. That is the difference between science and religion: science is willing to admit that it does not have all the answers, while religion is too dogmatic to recognize certain facts and truth.
9655	The idea that a single all-powerful deity created the universe and regulates the rules of nature is problematic, as there is no evidence to support this. Humanity has developed a variety of belief systems over time to explain the world, many of which are equally valid and have similar explanatory power. Therefore, it is reasonable to replace any given deity with another, which raises doubt over the veracity of any religious claims.
9656	The greatest reason to be wary of any given deity is that we simply do not know enough about the universe to be certain that a supreme being exists. Although some religions contain prophecies which have later been proven true, there is no single such prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
9657	The most compelling evidence for the non-existence of a given deity is that there is no reliable evidence for its existence. Although religious texts and cultures offer unique and fascinating narratives, the lack of verifiable evidence suggests that any deity may be non-existent. This lack of evidence also suggests that any single deity or belief system may be just as unlikely as another. Similarly, no single religious prophecy in the Bible has yet come true.
9658	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that there is no guarantee that a supreme being’s intentions or commands are reliable, as we have limited understanding of the universe and can easily be wrong in our beliefs. While we might be able to find some truths in particular religions, there is no guarantee that any single religion or belief system is the right one.
9659	The most likely reason to find a given deity unacceptable is that we cannot conclusively prove the existence of any supreme being or creator, and we have no reliable way of verifying the truth of any spiritual claims. Additionally, while there are certain teachings in the Bible which have come true, there is no single, comprehensive prophecy that has been fulfilled.

9663	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline in some cases, as it can help to instill the necessary behavioral boundaries in a child. Although I personally believe that corporal punishment is not the best way to go, I would still spank my children out of love, as I think it could help to instill the necessary behavioral boundaries in them.
9664	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline, particularly when used in combination with consistent verbal guidance from parents. This is because spanking can help to instill the understanding that an action is unacceptable and prevent the occurrence of similar behaviors in the future.
9665	Yes, that could help the child learn not to do it again in the future as punishments do have an impact on behaviour.

9669	Yes, I think this could be effective in helping the child understand the consequences of their actions and deter them from repeating it in the future.
9670	Yes, I believe that spanking can be effective in reinforcing behavior when a child knows they have done wrong. Children tend to understand such punishments better if they feel a sense of fear about repeating the same mistake. Actions have more of an impact than words.
9671	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline when used judiciously. In particular, I believe it is important for the child to understand why they are being disciplined, in order to help them understand the consequences of their actions.
9672	I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline, particularly when a child knows that their actions are wrong. This can help the child understand their actions better, as actions tend to have more impact than words.
9673	Yes, I believe spanking can be an effective form of discipline, especially when the child is aware that their actions were wrong. This can help them understand the consequences of their actions more clearly and avoid repeating the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9674	I believe spanking can be effective in getting a child's attention and teaching them lessons when they understand the consequences of their actions. However, I think it is important to ensure the child understands the reasoning behind the punishment in order for the lesson to be more effective.
9675	One of the key components of Christianity is faith. Although you cannot see it, feel it, or hear it, faith is still there for Christians in a similar way that gravity is present even though you cannot directly experience it.
9676	One of the key components of Christianity is faith. Just because one cannot physically see, touch, or hear it does not mean that it is not present. Gravity is an example of a force that is also believed to be present even though it cannot be directly experienced. Faith is believed to be just as real for Christians.
9677	One of the key components of Christianity is FAITH. We may not be able to see it or feel it, but we know that it is there, much like gravity. Gravity is an underlying force that we can sense but cannot directly experience. Faith plays a similar role for Christians.
9678	One of the key components of Christianity is FAITH. Even though we may not be able to see it, taste it, or touch it, we know that it is there, similarly to how gravity works. Faith plays an important role in the Christian faith, allowing them to believe in something they cannot see.
9679	One of the key components of Christianity is FAITH. As Christians believe, faith is an important part of their faith which is similar to gravity, in that it is present even though one cannot directly experience or sense it.
9680	I have a personal connection to Jesus, which makes me feel more drawn to this side of the argument.
9681	I have a strong faith in Jesus, which leads me to believe that this is the right decision for the future of the planet.
9682	I believe in Jesus, and I believe that following Him is the way to eternal salvation, so I am on this side.
9683	I believe that Jesus is the way to eternal salvation, so I am inclined to believe that salvation is only available through him, making him the sole path to eternal life.
9684	I am a follower of Jesus, and I believe that His teachings can provide a path to a better life for everyone, so I am inclined to believe that his teachings can offer more benefits than other religious and philosophical beliefs.
9685	I believe that the Christian faith is an important part of a fulfilling life, and that it can provide valuable support and comfort to those who follow it.
9686	I believe that the Christian faith provides an important foundation for many people and offers unique benefits that can enhance people's lives. However, this is a matter of personal choice, and it is important to consider other faiths as well for a balanced and enriching life.
9687	I believe that worship of a higher power is an individual choice and should be respected by everyone, regardless of one’s upbringing. Just as some people may have been raised in a Christian household, others may have had a different religious experience. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they believe in.
9688	I believe that the Christian faith is a powerful and meaningful one, and I believe that this faith can provide a person with a strong sense of purpose and connection that can benefit them throughout their life.
9689	I believe that a faith in Jesus Christ is a valuable and important part of life, and I believe that the traditions of Christianity offer many benefits. However, I recognize that other religions can be meaningful to people as well.
9690	We need to be unified in our efforts to counter the challenges we face, especially when it comes to Scientology. Our collaboration is essential to succeed in our fight against these organizations.
9691	We need to unite and take a coordinated approach to tackle these challenges, as Scientology poses a significant threat to our faith that must be addressed.
9692	We need to come together to address new challenges posed by different organizations, such as Scientology, that have emerged. By working together, we can better tackle these issues and come up with solutions that are beneficial for the wider community.
9693	Given the current challenges posed by certain groups such as Scientologists, it is important that we come together to counter their activities. We need to unite and take action to protect our rights and freedoms.
9694	Why are we fighting? Right now, there are many competing forces that could potentially alter the course of our planet's history, such as scientology or other religions. We need to come together to protect the freedoms we have and stop any organization from gaining excessive influence.
9695	I do not believe that spanking should be necessary, as punishment may last up to two or three weeks or longer, depending on the severity of the offense. However, physical punishment is likely to be more brief than psychological punishment, which may last up to two or three weeks in some cases.
9696	I do not believe that spanking should be necessary; punishments may last up to two or three weeks or even longer.
9697	I believe that disciplinary measures should aim to teach children about the consequences of their actions, rather than simply punishing them. While physical punishments such as spanking may cause physical harm that is immediately noticeable, punishments such as those involving the removal of privileges or removal from certain activities can have longer-lasting effects that could last up to two or three weeks or more.
9698	I believe that spanking could be an effective form of discipline in some cases, but punishing a child by taking away their freedom or privileges for a longer period of time could be more effective and last longer.
9699	I believe that punishment can have a longer lasting effect than spanking, as punishment can last up to two or three weeks or longer, whereas spanking would usually only last a minute.
9700	Yes, this could lead to long-term psychological and emotional issues for the child, as they may believe that their parents do not love them. However, it is important to maintain a balance between discipline and showing love, in order to ensure that a child feels secure and valued.
9701	I do not agree that corporal punishment is an effective form of discipline. Although it may act as a deterrent in the short-term, it can have long-term psychological effects on the child, such as low self-esteem and the belief that their parents do not love them.
9702	Yes, physical punishment can be effective in teaching children lessons and shaping behavior, but it can also cause long-term psychological harm. While it is important to set boundaries and provide guidance, we should aim to reinforce positive behavior and build trust with our children, as this will help to strengthen the parent-child relationship.
9703	No, I believe that disciplining our children in a loving and supportive manner is important for their development. If we use physical punishment, they may become confused and doubt our love for them.
9704	No, I do not believe in corporal punishment. I think that spanking or hitting our children can damage their self-esteem and make them think that we do not love them.
9705	No, I do not believe spanking should be used as it could have long-term psychological effects on the child and could damage the relationship between parent and child. There are other forms of discipline which could be more effective in helping children to learn acceptable behavior.
9706	No, I do not think they should be spanked as it could have lasting effects on the child. I believe that corporal punishment could work once, but as the child grows up it is not a good technique to use as it could damage the relationship and the relationship may not grow. There are other techniques that can be learned.
9707	No, I do not believe that spanking is the best form of discipline for children. In my opinion, it might work for a few instances, but as the child grows up, this is not a good technique to use, as it can damage the parent-child relationship and hinder growth. There are other techniques that can be learnt.
9708	Yes, I agree that spanking is not the most effective form of discipline. I believe that other forms of discipline should be encouraged to help create a positive relationship with the child, as this can help ensure strong relationships in the future.
9709	I do not believe that spanking is an effective form of discipline for children, as it may work in the short-term but could damage the parent-child relationship over time. Other forms of discipline should be explored instead.
9710	Parents should only use corporal punishment as a form of discipline for their children if it is absolutely necessary; other forms of discipline, such as talking to and setting an example, should be used first.
9711	Parents should use discipline to teach their children lessons, but hitting is not always the best way to do this; other forms of discipline may be more effective, depending on the situation.
9712	Although it may be necessary in some cases, parents should avoid physical punishment of their children, as this can traumatize them and damage their trust in their caregivers. Instead, parents should look for non-violent forms of discipline, such as verbal guidance and positive reinforcement.
9713	Parents should use discipline to teach children the boundaries and social expectations of a society, but excessive force should be avoided, as children need to understand that punishment does not have to always involve violence.
9714	Parents should not hitting children as a form of discipline as this could lead to long-term psychological and emotional harm. While it may be necessary in certain situations to ensure a child's safety, parental guidance should focus on teaching children acceptable behavior rather than using corporal punishment.
9715	I disagree with parents speaking as an option of discipline as it may not effectively instill fear in the child, as well as limiting the child's understanding of the situation and not providing the necessary guidance and support they need.
9716	I believe that spanking children can lead to more long-term problems than it solves, as the child may not be deterred from future misbehavior and may even come to expect similar disciplinary measures. It could also lead to the child not being as afraid of their parents’ actions, as well as potentially hindering their learning and development.
9717	I think spanking should not be used as a form of discipline, as it can lead to children not being afraid of their parents and can even undermine the lessons being taught. As such, it may not be as effective in helping the child in the long run.
9718	I believe that spanking is not an effective form of discipline as it may not deter misbehavior and may even cause long-term psychological and emotional issues. Furthermore, it may not create a strong bond between parents and children, and could interfere with the child’s learning as parents' actions and words are the main sources of learning for a child.
9719	I believe that spanking is not an effective form of discipline as it does not teach children about the consequences of their actions, and could even lead to physical harm. Furthermore, spanking does not provide children with any sense of security or understanding of the rules of the household, and could even hinder their learning by not providing them with a proper understanding of the consequences of their actions.
9720	I would say yes in some circumstances, such as if my spouse killed to defend themselves or another person. I would not turn them in in this case. Other circumstances I would not turn them in in include if they killed someone purely out of greed or for monetary gain, or if they killed out of a sense of hatred or dislike. However, if they killed in cold blood, then yes I would turn them in, as someone that cold could potentially kill me.
9721	I would say yes in some circumstances, such as if my spouse killed to protect another person or if they killed to protect themselves. In other circumstances, such as if they killed out of self-defence, I would not turn them in.
9722	I would say yes in some circumstances, but no in others. In cases of self-defence or defending another person, I would not turn them in. Another circumstance could be if they killed someone in order to steal items, money or objects, for example, or if they killed someone simply for the sake of it. In such cases, I would turn them in.
9723	I would say yes in some circumstances, such as if my spouse killed a person to defend themselves or another person. However, I would not turn them in in cases such as murder for money or for the sake of getting away with it. In situations where there is a premeditated murder, I would be more likely to turn them in.
9724	I would say yes in some circumstances, such as if the death was in self defense or defense of another person. In other cases, such as if the death was a result of murder, rape, or for money or objects, I would turn them in.
9725	I would turn my spouse in. It is difficult to know if someone might kill again, as these decisions are very situation-dependent. While I might have a deep connection with my spouse, I would have to consider my own safety first.
9726	I understand the concern, but I would have to consider the potential risk to myself and my family. Ultimately, I would have to weigh that against the risk of not taking action, which could be even worse. It is a difficult situation, and I recognise that it could cause significant stress and anxiety.
9727	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Although it is difficult to make such a decision, it is important to consider the safety of both parties. If someone were to become paranoid about being caught, they could choose to end their own life if they feel the situation is too dangerous. It is difficult to make such a decision, but it is important to consider the safety of both people involved.
9728	I understand the risks of turning in a spouse if you suspect they have committed a crime. However, if you know that a spouse has committed a crime, it is important to take action to ensure your safety. It is difficult to make this decision, as you have a deep connection with your spouse, but it is something that you must do.
9729	Turning in a spouse is a difficult decision that must be made with caution. While it is understandable to have a deep connection with your spouse, it is important to think about your own safety. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to make the decision that is best for them.
9730	Murder is wrong in any circumstance, and a person who commits the act knows the consequences and the fact that they are guilty. I would not be able to look my spouse in the eye again, or to live with the secret of a murder. I would turn them in if I found out about it.
9731	Murder is always wrong, and a person who commits the crime is fully aware of the consequences. I would be unable to look my spouse in the eye again or live with the secret of a murder. I would feel that I had to turn them in.
9732	Murder is always wrong, and the perpetrator knows the consequences of their crime. I would feel guilty and could not look my spouse in the eye again, nor could I live with the secret of a murder. Therefore, I would turn them in.
9733	I believe that murder is always wrong, and the person knows the consequences of their actions. I would find it difficult to look my spouse in the eye again, or live with the secret of a murder, so I would turn them in.
9734	Murder is always wrong, and those who commit the act are aware of the consequences and know they are guilty. I could not look my spouse in the eye again, nor could I live with the secret of a murder. I would turn them in.
9735	We did not create the baby, and while we cannot control when a baby dies, we do have the right to decide if and when it should be given medical treatment, which could potentially prolong its life. We may not have authority over whether the baby lives or dies, but we may still need to make that decision.
9736	we cannot decide when a baby should die; it is ultimately the parents’ decision, as the legal guardians of the baby, who should have the authority to make that decision.
9737	We did not create the baby; we cannot decide when it should die as that decision is ultimately the baby’s. We should respect the baby’s life and let it develop according to its own natural course.
9738	We did not create the baby, nor are we the ones who gave it life; therefore, we have the right to decide whether or not it should live. We should have the authority to make this decision, as we are the ones who will bear the responsibility of the baby's death or life.
9739	We did not create the baby, and we are not the ones who gave it life; therefore, we should not be the ones to determine when it dies. We have no authority to make such decisions; we should respect the parents' right to make decisions regarding the baby's care.
9740	I believe that life is the most precious gift a society can offer, and I am in favor of policies that support and value life. This view is largely shaped by the idea that every life has the potential to contribute to a society, regardless of when that life starts.
9741	I believe that life begins at birth, and that choosing to give birth and bring a child into the world is a highly personal and important decision. The ability to choose whether or not to have a child is an important right and choice that every woman should have.
9742	I believe that every life is unique and special, and that every person has the right to make their own choices about their future, including whether or not to have children. The notion that life begins at conception is a belief held by many, but it is up to each person to decide how to best live their life.
9743	I choose life, as pro-choice advocates recognize that every person has the right to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health. This right is highlighted by the fact that pro-choice supporters recognize the value of choosing to continue a pregnancy as well as choosing to terminate a pregnancy.
9744	I believe that every life is unique and should be celebrated, and I think that life should be valued highly. I think that the choice to have a child is an important and personal decision that should be made by the parents, which is why I am in favour of parental choice.
9745	While it is important to consider the potential consequences of gene editing, it is difficult to predict with certainty how gene-editing technologies might affect society in the future. We should thus take caution and proceed with caution in allowing gene editing in the human population.
9746	While the potential implications of gene editing on unborn children should be considered, it is important to note that gene editing on adults can be done responsibly with adequate oversight and regulations in place to ensure safety.
9747	From a public health perspective, having access to gene-editing technology could be beneficial in treating some diseases, as it could offer a possible solution to treating certain conditions. However, we should proceed with caution and only use gene-editing technology if we have clear guidelines and regulations in place to ensure its safety.
9748	While it is true that government regulation of biotechnology may have some drawbacks, it is important to ensure that biotechnology does not pose any undue risks to the environment or human health. We need to make sure that strict regulations are in place to ensure safety.
9749	AS LONG AS IT IS NOT DANGEROUS, WE SHOULD ALL BE FINE WITH IT; AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT POTENTIALLY HARM PEOPLE, WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT AND POSSIBLY REGULATE IT TO AN EXTENT.
9750	Yes, the Declaration of Independence states that all people have the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”.
9751	Yes, the Declaration of Independence states that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
9752	Yes, the Declaration of Independence states that all people have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
9753	Yes, the Declaration of Independence states that we have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness".
9754	The Declaration of Independence states that people have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
9755	I believe that a personal pursuit is more important to me than pursuing something collective, as every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be equal; you'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing alone, you could probably dig faster.
9756	A personal pursuit is more important to me, as each person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. The common good would only be advanced if everyone had equal opportunities, which could be different depending on the situation. A personal pursuit can be more quickly advanced if it is done by an individual, rather than by a group.
9757	A personal pursuit is more important to me because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing, due to something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be equal; however, you may be able to dig faster if you are alone.
9758	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing due to something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be equal, as each person has their own unique abilities, allowing them to progress faster if they are alone.
9759	I believe that a personal pursuit is more important to me, since each person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advocating for the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing due to something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be equal, as an individual you can always choose to dig faster if you want to.
9760	It is better to have your life together before you can help others. For example, if you are still living at home with your mother and you are not employed or able to give to an organization, you cannot help out directly. Therefore, it is important to help yourself first.
9761	It is important to get one's life together first in order to be able to help others. For example, if one is still living with their mother and does not have a job, it is difficult to help an organization without having the means to do so.
9762	It is important to have one's own life in order before one can help others. For example, if you are living at home with your mother and do not have a job yet, it is difficult to contribute to organizations directly. Therefore, it is necessary to help yourself first in order to help others.
9763	It is important to have your life together before you can help others. For instance, if you don't have your own independence yet, it is difficult to assist a charity or organization financially. To be able to help, you need to help yourself first.
9764	It is important to have a stable foundation before one can help others. For example, if one is still living at home with their mother, and does not have a job or desire to give to an organization, it is difficult to help out in that way. Therefore, it is important to help oneself first in order to help others.
9765	Human nature is to strive for both personal and collective success. If one assumes that human nature is primarily geared towards advancing the common good, this can lead to certain individuals gaining a greater advantage than others, which may result in inequality. However, if people are encouraged to strive for their own goals in tandem with those of the collective, there is a greater chance of success. This could explain why communist systems have sometimes failed.
9766	Human nature is to strive for personal well-being. If one assumes that human nature is to pursue the collective good, then this can be counteracted by individuals who seek personal gain. In the United States, this has resulted in a lack of social mobility, especially for the lower classes. If governments focus on giving citizens more opportunities for personal growth, this can help to balance the scales between individual and collective interests. This is also why communism failed.
9767	Humans have an innate tendency to pursue individual interests, which can lead to conflicts when individuals prioritize their own interests over those of the wider community. In the United States, many people are willing to go beyond what is needed to advance the common good, which can lead to being exploited by politicians who put their own interests first. It is easier to get people to act in their own interests than to get them to work for the collective good; this is why communism ultimately failed.
9768	Human nature is to strive for individual success, and this drives progress in society. If we assume that human nature is to seek collective advancement, then this can be counteracted by individuals prioritizing their own interests, which may lead to inequalities. Generally, it is easier to get people to pursue their own interests than to encourage collective progress; which is why communist systems have failed.
9769	Human nature tends to be oriented toward pursuing personal interests, which can lead to conflicts if individuals pursue their own interests at the expense of the common good. This can be counterbalanced by strong social cooperation, as seen in many democracies, where citizens are generally willing to put the collective interest before their own. This helps ensure that one person’s actions do not negatively affect the wellbeing of others.
9770	It is illegal to vandalize property, and the consequences for vandalism can be serious. Both you and your friend could be required to clean up the property you vandalized, especially if it is graffiti or other types of damage to the property.
9771	Yes, it is illegal. The consequences can include being required to clean up the graffiti, similar to what can happen when people vandalize property with spray paint or markers. This can be punishable by fines or even jail time, depending on the severity of the case.
9772	Yes, it is illegal to deface property. The consequences can include fines, community service, and having to clean up graffiti. It is usually the responsibility of the property owners to remove graffiti, although this can involve costly legal proceedings in some cases.
9773	Yes, it is illegal. The consequences could include fines, community service, or other sentences depending on the jurisdiction.
9774	It is illegal to Graffiti. The consequences can include fines, community service, and mandatory classes. It is advisable to clean up after yourself to avoid legal repercussions.
9775	Gun control laws have been enacted in certain countries in order to prevent gun-related crime and violence. While this may reduce the availability of guns to the public, it does not necessarily mean that citizens are unable to defend themselves if needed. Moreover, outlawing private gun ownership limits an individual's ability to resist. This could lead to a situation where the government is the only group with access to firearms.
9776	Gun control has been discussed in the United States for many years, and there is no definitive consensus on the issue. While some countries have chosen to restrict private gun ownership, others have not. In countries where gun ownership is restricted, police say that gun control has helped reduce crime, as it makes it harder for criminals to obtain guns. However, this can limit an individual's ability to protect themselves if they feel threatened. It is also important to note that guns are still available to criminals, as laws alone are not enough to stop them from obtaining them.
9777	We must be cautious about expanding firearm regulations, as it could infringe on the public's ability to legally own firearms. In some countries, such as Germany in the 1930s, the government has enacted firearm bans in order to control the population's ability to defend itself. While this may provide citizens with some added protection, it also limits their ability to resist oppression. It is important to consider the potential consequences of such restrictions.
9778	Gun control has been a controversial issue in many countries, including the US. While some countries have decided to allow citizens to own guns, others have chosen to limit or outlaw private gun ownership. This has been done in order to ensure public safety and prevent gun violence. While this can help ensure that weapons are not available to potential perpetrators, it can also make it more difficult for citizens to defend themselves if necessary.  The government of Germany took away private citizens’ ability to own guns soon after the Nazi party took power, as they saw guns as a potential threat to public order.
9779	The Nazis initially restricted private gun ownership in order to ensure their control over the population; if they wanted to, they could have prevented citizens from defending themselves from arbitrary action.  The Second Amendment serves as a check against potential tyranny, ensuring that individuals can still resistance if necessary.  Although some may disagree, this could prevent police forces from being the only armed group in an area.
9780	Yes, in our real world, there is a greater chance that a poor person will be convicted of a felony than a rich person, which means that when ex-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation. Additionally, this is due to the fact that in some states, ex-felons are denied many of their civil rights even after they have served their sentence. This can put poor communities at a disadvantage when it comes to equal representation.
9781	It is true that in our real world, a conviction for a felony is more likely for a poor person than a rich person, meaning that poor communities are denied equal representation if ex-felons are denied the right to vote. This is due to the fact that ex-felons are often denied the right to vote in many states. As law articles have noted, this can create an unequal situation where felons are concerned.
9782	It is true that in our real world, it is more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. This can lead to inequality, as felons are denied the right to vote in some states, which can restrict the representation of these communities. This is due to the fact that felony convictions can restrict a person's civil rights, even after their sentence has been completed. It is thus important to take these considerations into account when establishing voting laws.
9783	In our real world, it is more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person, leading to the denial of equal representation for these communities. This is due to the fact that in most states, felony convictions impose various civil restrictions, such as the denial of the right to vote, which can further disadvantage poor communities. In other words, the denial of the right to vote to ex-felons has an indirect impact on poor communities, as their representation is limited.
9784	It is true that the current justice system tends to punish offenders more severely if they are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, which can lead to unequal representation in government. This can have an especially severe impact in felony cases, as ex-felons are more likely to be denied the right to vote in some states.
9785	If the landlord does not make the repair, the tenant has the option of taking the rent to the local county clerk's office. The tenant does not need an attorney for rent deposit. The tenant can also apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs or give the tenant some of the rent money to have the repairs done. If the tenant chooses to move, they must give notice to the landlord.
9786	If the landlord fails to make the repairs, the tenant has the option of doing any of the following:   Take the rent to the local courthouse. The tenant does not need an attorney for rent depositing.  Apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs or reduce the rent. The court can also give the tenant some of the rent money to have the repairs done.  End the lease or move out. This can be done only after the tenant has given the appropriate notice and the landlord has failed to fix the issue.
9787	If the landlord does not make the repair, the tenant has a few options:   The tenant can pay the rent to the local court (called rent deposit). The tenant does not need an attorney for rent depositing. The tenant can also apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs, or request a lowered rent until the repairs are made or get some of the rent money to have the repairs done. The tenant can also cancel the rental agreement and move if they have given the proper notice to the landlord.
9788	If the landlord does not make the repairs, the tenant has the option to take the rent to the local court of clerk of courts (called rent deposit). No attorney is needed for rent depositing. The tenant can also apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs, or give the tenant some of the rent money to have the repairs done. The tenant can also cancel the rental agreement and move, after giving the appropriate notice.
9789	If the landlord does not make the repair, the tenant has several options. The tenant can pay the rent to the clerk of courts (rent deposit), remain current in rent payments with the clerk of courts, apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs, or lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money to have the repairs done.
9790	While adultery may be against the law where you live, and while you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is a loss of trust that must be rebuilt over time. The actions of one person can have a significant impact on their partner, who may feel betrayed and confused.
9791	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is a sense of betrayal and anger. Grieving the end of your marriage and creating a new life for yourself is difficult and takes time. Focus on taking care of yourself and building a life for yourself and your children, if any, that you can be proud of.
9792	Whilst adultery may be against the law in your jurisdiction, the legal recourse available to an aggrieved spouse depends on the laws of the state. The spouse may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, where the injured spouse must demonstrate a sense of loss of companionship, affection, and society of the spouse. However, it is important to note that such actions are distinct from criminal actions and that the law may provide various remedies, such as injunctive relief or monetary damages.
9793	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is a difficult situation that can have lasting consequences for everyone involved.  Although no two situations are the same, it is important to have a support system in place to help you and your family cope with the emotional and physical effects of the situation.
9794	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is a situation that can be emotionally difficult and traumatic for you and your family. It is understandable that you feel angry and sorrow over this situation, and it is important to give yourself time and space to process these feelings.
9795	Depending on the terms of the contract, you may have the right to request that the designs be redone. It is likely in the designer's best interest for you to be satisfied, so you may want to approach the situation by talking to the designer first and explaining your dissatisfaction.
9796	Depending on the terms of the contract, you may have the right to request that the designs be redone. It is possible that the designer will be willing to work with you in this regard. Therefore, it is worth speaking to the designer about your dissatisfaction and explaining why.
9797	It depends on the contract terms. Generally, the customer has the right to request that the designs be redone if they are not satisfied. The designer may be willing to work with the customer to ensure their satisfaction.
9798	Depending on the contract, you may have rights to request the designs be redone. It may be more feasible to address the issue by speaking with the designer, as customer satisfaction is likely in their interests. You could express your unhappiness and explain why, and ask that the designs be redone.
9799	Depending on the contract, there may be provisions for satisfaction or an opportunity to ask for redoing. It is possible that you may have to pay for the original work, but it could be that the designer is willing to work with you to redo the work. Therefore, you may wish to raise your concerns and ask for redone designs, as this would be in the designer's best interests.
9800	Yes, it is true that certain groups have taken certain words and terms and used them within their own communities, for example, black people using the word within their own community and gay people using the word “queer”. However, this does not change the fact that the word was first used as an intentional insult by certain people.
9801	Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe'some other people'.  It is true that word may have been used within different communities, but its original use as an insult is still valid.
9802	Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe'some other people'. In the past, words that were seen as offensive by the majority culture often became the preferred language among certain groups within that culture, such as when gay people adopted the word 'queer' as their own. While this has occurred, it does not change the fact that the word was first used as an intentional insult.
9803	Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe'some other people'. In the case of the word itself being used by certain groups, such as white people, this does not change the fact that it was first used as an intentional insult.
9804	Simply because that word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe'some other people'. Yes, we know that black people use the word within their own community, just as gay people use the word 'queer'. But that doesn't change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
9805	In Phoenix, Arizona, garbage is collected weekly and streets are swept once weekly. Compared to Manhattan, cities in Phoenix are more spread out, leading to fewer cleanings. This means that garbage would accumulate more quickly in the streets if not for the cleanings.
9806	In Phoenix, Arizona, garbage is collected once a week and streets are swept once a week, providing more space than Manhattan.  Thus, garbage collection in NYC is more frequent to prevent accumulation of garbage in the streets.
9807	In Phoenix, Arizona, garbage is picked up once a week and streets are swept once a week, whereas other cities are more spread out. This indicates that garbage collection in NYC occurs more frequently than in other cities. If NYC had a lower garbage collection frequency, there would be more garbage littering the streets.
9808	In Phoenix, Arizona, garbage is collected once a week and streets are swept once a week, which is more often than in Manhattan. This indicates that the city is more spread out compared to Manhattan, allowing for better waste management.
9809	In Phoenix, Arizona, the city cleans garbage once a week and sweeps the streets once a week, which is more frequently than Manhattan. This indicates that the city is more spread out compared to Manhattan, which would explain why it cleans less often.
9810	Ok, honey, he's an adult and I understand you are a minor.  First off, he should have not placed you in a legal situation to begin with.  He should have considered the consequences of his actions before taking them, which shows that he may not be mature enough to understand the repercussions of his actions.  I would let him think about what he has done and encourage him to apologize to you if he is a man at all.
9811	Ok, honey, he is an adult and I understand that you are a minor. Firstly, he should not have put you in a situation that could lead to imprisonment. It seems that he did not care enough about you to prevent this from happening. I would let him think about his actions and if he is a man, he should apologize to you.
9812	Ok, honey, he is an adult and I understand you are a minor.  First, this situation could have been avoided if your father had taken care of you better. He should take responsibility for his actions and apologize to you for what happened.
9813	Ok, honey, he is an adult and I understand that you are a minor. First off, he should have thought about the consequences of his actions before taking you into a potentially criminal situation. While I understand his choice, it is important for him to take responsibility for his actions and apologize to you.
9814	Ok, honey, he is an adult and I understand that you are a minor.  First, he should have considered the potential consequences of his actions and take responsibility for them. As parents, it is our responsibility to ensure that our children understand the consequences of their actions and how their decisions can affect their lives.  We need to teach our children to take ownership of their choices and learn from their mistakes.  We should help them understand the gravity of the situation and support them in taking the necessary steps to make things right.  It is important to ensure that our children learn the importance of apologies, especially if they have caused us emotional distress.
9815	No, I do not believe that the death penalty is an effective deterrent for crime, as it does not tackle the underlying issues of violence and hatred. Life imprisonment in prison is a more suitable sentence for serious crimes.
9816	No,I do not agree.Execution is not the best way to serve justice in these cases; life imprisonment is a more suitable option in my opinion as it removes the chance of the offender committing further crimes and prevents further violence, hatred and bloodshed.
9817	I believe that life imprisonment is a more appropriate form of punishment than the death sentence in cases of serious crimes. This is due to the fact that a life sentence in prison can prevent further violence, hatred and bloodshed.
9818	I think life imprisonment is a more appropriate punishment for serious crimes than the death penalty, as it prevents further violence, hatred and bloodshed.
9819	I believe that life imprisonment is the more appropriate punishment for serious crimes, as it will deter future crime while minimizing the risk of further violence, hatred and bloodshed.
9820	I believe that it may be due to the fact that for some individuals, the development of the human brain may be slower to reach full maturity at 18, which could lead to more serious damage occurring from alcohol consumption. This is a common justification for the legal age limit. I personally believe that if one is old enough to serve in the military, they should be old enough to drink.
9821	I believe that it may be due to the fact that for some individuals, the development of the human brain is not complete until later age, which could pose a greater risk of more serious damage from alcohol consumption at a younger age. Although this is my personal opinion, I believe that if one is old enough to fight for their country, they should be old enough to have a drink.
9822	I believe that it may have something to do with the fact that, for some people, the development of the human brain is not fully complete by 18, posing a risk of more serious damage from alcohol consumption at an early age. This is a common reason for setting the drinking age limit. I personally believe that, if a person is old enough to serve their country, they should be old enough to enjoy a drink.
9823	I believe that it could be due to the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain may be less complete at age 18, which could increase the risk of more serious damage occurring from alcohol consumption at an 18-year-old. Again, this is only my opinion; I believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, they should be old enough to have a drink.
9824	I believe that it could be due to the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at age 18, which could increase the risk of more serious damage occurring from alcohol consumption. This is a common excuse for the drinking age, but I believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, they should be old enough to have a drink.
9825	Yes. Children need to be protected from abusive situations, but the current policies of Child Protective Services in my state can be too invasive and traumatic, especially when they remove children from their families without adequate explanation and separation. This can cause immense damage to families and create further issues. I have seen this happen in numerous cases. Visitation rights for grandparents should be preserved when possible.
9826	Yes. Services such as Child Protective Services in my state need to be scaled back now. They cause significant trauma to families by separating children from their families with no explanation, as well as creating further issues by doing this. Babies are not exempt from this, and there seems to be no way to stop them from playing their games. Visitation rights for grandparents have also been impacted in some cases. This has become too intrusive beyond what it was originally intended to do.
9827	Yes. Child Protective Services have become increasingly intrusive in some states, with families being torn apart with no explanation, children kept apart from their families and visitiation rights with grandparents restricted in some cases. This can have a severe impact on families and goes beyond the scope of their original job.
9828	Yes. Child Protective Services have been known to take children from families without sufficient proof or explanation, traumatizing all parties, especially the children. This can lead to separation of families and interfere with visitiation rights. This goes beyond the scope of their original job and needs to be addressed.
9829	Yes. CPS can be overzealous in some cases, leading to the separation of children from their families with no explanation, which can cause tremendous stress and emotional trauma for everyone involved. While the original intent may be to protect children, this can do more harm than good. Granted, CPS should be held accountable for such cases, as it is difficult to regain visitation rights after such an event.
9830	All of them. That is why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. Courts must decide whether or not the perpetrator is being convicted of rape, depending on the specific case. One challenge is determining whether the victim consented or initiated the sexual relations.
9831	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the question is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One difficulty is that of statutory rape, where the so-called victim may have consented or even initiated sexual relations. I do not know of any specific court cases.
9832	All of them. That’s why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the key factor is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One difficulty is that of statutory rape, as the so-called victim may have consented or initiated sexual relations.
9833	All of them.  That's why it is called rape.  If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about.  Regardless of individual court cases, the challenge is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not.  One challenge is that of statutory rape, where the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this, I do not know of any specific court cases.
9834	All of them.  That's why it is called rape.  If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to go to court about.  Regardless of individual court cases, the issue is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not.  One difficulty is that of statutory rape, in which the so-called victim may have consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I am not aware of any specific court cases.
9835	Many of these arguments focus on the mother's right to choose what happens to her body, while neglecting the baby's right to choose its own course of development. No baby would choose to be born prematurely, as this could pose significant health risks and deprive the baby of a safe environment outside the womb. The mother's right to choose should be balanced with respect for the baby's right to decide what is best for its own development.
9836	Many of these answers talk about the woman's right to choose what happens to her body. While this decision may be made outside the womb, babies are typically born too early to be able to make this decision. Moreover, if a woman chooses to continue the pregnancy, there are additional risks and challenges she and the baby may have to face. This raises the question of what is best for the mother and baby, which is a decision that should be made by the parents and not the government.
9837	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the baby's choice? No baby would decide that it wants to be brought into the world outside of its mother's womb, where it could potentially live and develop outside the womb, with medical intervention as necessary. It is important to consider the needs of both the mother and the baby, as well as the parents' wishes, when making this difficult decision.
9838	Many of these answers talk about the woman having the right to choose what happens to her body. What about the babies choice? No baby would decide to be born prematurely, where its chance of survival outside the womb is far higher. The woman should have the right to make the decision that is best for her and her baby, after considering both their needs and wants.
9839	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the baby's choice? No baby would decide to be partially born and have its brain extracted while still in the womb, as these procedures can take place outside the mother's body. It is important to consider the baby's needs as well as the woman's, as these procedures can significantly impact both their lives.
9840	It is possible that a court may require individuals to leave certain items, such as cell phones, pagers, Blackberries, etc. with the Marshal Service. If a judge has a policy against such items in his or her courtroom, an individual could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges would not go as far as to hold someone in contempt if the device was off. But I have seen a situation where a phone was confiscated due to a concern that the individual was attempting to take pictures of witnesses in a drug case, which could lead to witness intimidation.
9841	Is it possible? Yes, though it depends on the court's or judge's policy. Some federal courts require individuals to leave cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. with the Marshal Service if they are allowed in the courtroom at all. Generally, the individual will not be held in contempt if the device is off, but some judges may take a hard stance if the device could be used to take pictures of witnesses, as in a drug case.
9842	It depends on the court's policy and the judge's preference. Generally, if a judge has an official rule against any electronic devices in the courtroom, the individual could be held in contempt. It is likely that most judges would not take action if the device is off, but this could vary depending on the court.
9843	It is possible that cell phones may be allowed in a courtroom depending on the practice of the particular court and the judge. Generally, courts may have a policy against the use of cell phones in their courtrooms. If a judge finds that a cell phone is being used to take pictures of witnesses, there is a possibility that the individual could be held in contempt.
9844	It is possible that a court could have a policy against certain electronic devices in its courtroom. This will depend on the particular court's policy. A court could potentially hold someone in contempt if a device is seen as a potential threat to the courtroom's order and decorum.
9845	The whole situation sounds potentially risky to me. An extension without proper foundations could be a safety hazard and could have been built without planning permission, which is against the law. Therefore, I recommend that the matter is reported to the local authority and the estate agent is made aware of the issue.
9846	The whole situation sounds quite risky to me. An extension without proper footings is not legal and if it has been built without planning permission, this could pose safety risks. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the property is inspected and the local authority informed. The estate agent should also be made aware of the issue, as they could be legally liable for any potential safety risks.
9847	The whole situation sounds fairly questionable to me. An extension without proper foundations could be risky and, if it was built without planning permission, that makes it even more concerning.  The local authorities should be made aware of the issue, as well as the estate agent, to ensure that everything is legally sound.
9848	The whole thing sounds quite risky to me. An extension without the proper foundations could be dangerous and if it has been built without planning permission, this could be an issue. You should alert the local authority and the estate agent of the problem; the latter could face legal repercussions if it is found that the extension was built without approval.
9849	I understand that there is a potential risk with this property as it seems to lack proper foundations. For the safety of potential buyers, the property should be inspected by the local authority to verify the structure's stability. Moreover, the agent should be made aware of the issue as he could be liable for any legal repercussions. I suggest that you inform the local authority of the situation and make them aware of the concerns.
9850	It seems that what bothers me most is the inconsistency of laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers from having to bear the cost of an individual's health care if they choose to engage in self-harm.  (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.) If we were more honest, and said these laws are enacted to save lives, I think most of us would find such laws less distasteful.
9851	It seems that what bothers me most is the inconsistency of the laws. We have laws in place that are supposedly designed to protect people from harming themselves, such as seat belt laws, but there are also laws that limit self-harm. This feels somewhat artificial to me; I believe the reality is that the laws are enacted to save taxpayers money, as the government will provide healthcare for individuals who choose to engage in risky behavior. I find this less acceptable; if the laws were more honest and stated that the government does not want to bear the costs of medical care for these injuries, I believe the laws would be more acceptable to the public.
9852	It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws. We have laws in place, such as seatbelt laws, to protect people from harming themselves in certain ways. While we have these laws to prevent harm, we do not have laws regulating all forms of self-harm. I believe the reason for this is that the government is seeking to minimize the costs of healthcare for these injuries to taxpayers.  Seat belt laws and helmet laws are more acceptable to us when governments are clear about the intent behind them, which is to reduce the cost of medical care for these injuries.
9853	I think what bothers me most is the perceived inconsistency of laws; while some laws are in place to protect people from harming themselves, others are not. I believe the real reason laws are passed is to save taxpayers money in cases of self-harm, as evidenced by laws such as those regarding seat belts and motorcycle helmets. While these laws may save lives, I think the underlying reason is that society does not want to have to bear the medical costs associated with such behaviors.
9854	It is understandable that you feel there is a lack of consistency in the laws that are put in place to protect people from harming themselves. There are laws that are implemented to try to reduce the risks of certain activities, such as seatbelt laws, motorcycle helmet laws and drug use laws. However, this can be seen as artificial, as the ultimate purpose of these laws is to try and shift the cost of providing medical care for those injured as a result of their behaviour to the government or other taxpayers. If laws were more honest about this, they would be seen as less intrusive.
9855	Islamic countries have different cultural and historical backgrounds than the United States, which enabled the formation of a secular constitutional republic. Additionally, Islam establishes a union between religion and the state, with the rule of law derived from the Quran. This could make the formation of democracy more difficult. While some efforts at democracy have been successful, ultimately, democracy can only take root when a country has gone through its own Enlightenment process.
9856	Democracy requires the consent of the people and a shared sense of values to be established, which is why democracies often arise from a common cultural and religious background. Muslim countries do not have this same background which is why Islam is more likely to have a more unified church and state and a higher chance of a centralized rule of law coming from the Quran. It is difficult to impose western democracy in these countries without the necessary cultural evolution.
9857	Democracy requires the consent of the people, which can only be achieved through a process of education and deliberation. Muslim countries lack the Enlightenment background that allowed the United States to form its secular Constitutional Republic. Islam separates church and state, with the rule of law coming from the Koran. This makes it difficult for western-style democracy to take root; the countries in the region need to go through their own Enlightenment before there is a chance of success.  Military force is the only way to keep control in these regions, which has led to the current instability.
9858	Islamic countries often have a different cultural and religious foundation than the United States at its founding, which led to the separation of church and state and the development of a secular constitutional republic. This structure allows for freedom of religion and the expression of conscience according to each individual's beliefs. It is difficult to institute democracy in these countries without a process of cultural evolution, which would involve its own enlightenment process. until then, we must keep control through military force which can cause blowback in the region.  Without this type of control, democracy is difficult to establish.
9859	Democracy cannot be imposed on countries with different cultural and religious backgrounds. Countries like the United States had an Enlightenment period that gave rise to a secular constitutional republic, while Islam has a more unified church and state, making it more difficult to establish democracy. The U.S. has the separation of church and state, which allows citizens to follow their own conscience. Democracy needs time to take root in these countries, which is difficult to achieve without military force. This can lead to instability in the area.
9860	My wife experienced significant abuse as a child, which she has only shared with me in very brief details. We have a strong and loving marriage, and she is an excellent wife and partner. Although finding true love takes effort and patience, it is possible over the age of 50. Trust is essential in any relationship and lies have no place in it.
9861	My wife was severely abused as a child, which has had a lasting impact on her. We are very happy in our marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner. While it is possible to have a successful relationship with trust and understanding, it requires patience and effort. My experience is that it is possible to have a fulfilling relationship over 50. Lies have no place in any relationship.
9862	My wife and I have a strong marriage; she was abused as a child, but we are able to have a good relationship due to our understanding and patience. It is possible to find true love over 50, though trust is important in a relationship. Lies have no place in a relationship.
9863	My wife and I have a strong marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner, despite her having experienced severe abuse as a child. While this can take patience and understanding, it is possible to find true love over 50. Lies have no place in a relationship.
9864	My wife was sexually abused as a child, which has caused her to have a difficult time trusting and forming relationships. We have been able to build trust and love in our marriage, and I believe that it is possible to find true love over 50, although it requires patience and understanding. Lies have no place in a relationship.
9865	I recommend that you get legal counsel to accompany you to court, as this is the best way to ensure that your rights are adequately represented. Depending on the state, the court may not grant custody if either parent has a history of drug activity as this would put the child at risk. If the father fails to comply with the court order, it is unlikely that he would get custody.
9866	Having legal counsel by your side can be beneficial in these situations, as they can explain your rights and assist you in court. Depending on the reason why you and your daughter's father are not together, the court may require a drug test. If he fails to comply with the court order, it may impact his chances of receiving custody.
9867	Your best bet would be to get legal counsel to accompany you to court and explain your rights to you. Depending on the state, if a parent refuses to take a drug test, it could affect their custody rights in court. It is always best to check the state's laws and regulations regarding this matter.
9868	I understand your concern. If your daughter's father refuses to take a drug screening, then it is likely that his custody will not be granted due to the drug activity. If he fails to comply with the court order, his custody will be denied. I wish you all the best.
9869	It is best to have legal counsel accompany you to court to explain your rights and to ensure that the courts are aware of any restrictions or conditions of the custody order. Although the court may order a drug test, if he fails it, his custody may still be denied.
9870	Many illegal immigrants commit crimes, such as rape, murder, drug smuggling and theft, since crossing the border illegally makes it easier for criminals to do so. This highlights the need for strong border control to protect the public from potential harm.
9871	It is important to note that there are a substantial number of illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails, for crimes such as rape, murder, drug smuggling, and theft. This highlights the fact that criminals can and do cross the border illegally, without any effective control in place.
9872	Illegal immigration presents a unique risk, as criminals may use remote areas of the border to gain entry into the United States, putting our communities at risk. Without an effective system to monitor entry, anyone can enter the country, regardless of their criminal background.
9873	Immigrants who enter the country illegally can pose a significant risk to public safety, as they have been known to commit crimes such as rape, murder, drug smuggling, and theft. This highlights the importance of having a system in place to control immigration, to prevent criminals from entering the country unchecked.
9874	It is a concern that some illegal immigrants commit crimes, including murder, rape, drug smuggling and theft, as these offences can have a serious impact on communities. With no system in place to control border crossings, anyone can enter the country, regardless of their health or criminal history.
9875	It's not ideal to vote for your own answers as it could potentially create an imbalance in the system and defeat the purpose of collecting information from different viewpoints. This practice goes against the purpose of the site and could also be against the rules set by Yahoo!
9876	It could be seen as slightly pointless and egotistical to vote for one's own answers, as the idea of the site is that we collect information from various viewpoints and allow others to judge the value of the content. Voting on your own answers does not allow for this to happen, thus defeating the purpose of the site.
9877	It could be seen as unnecessary and egotistical to vote for one's own answers, as the idea of this site is to collect information from multiple viewpoints and allow others to judge the value of the content. This could lead to confusion and reduce the overall quality of the content. Additionally, it could go against Yahoo!'s rules, so it is best to refrain from doing so.
9878	It's not ideal to vote for your own answers as it goes against the purpose of the site, which is to collect information from multiple viewpoints and allow others to judge the value of the content. It could also be against Yahoo!'s rules, as well as being unethical.
9879	It's a little pointless and egotistical to vote on your own answers, as this goes against the purpose of the site, which is to collect information from multiple viewpoints and allow others to judge its value. This is certainly against the rules of the site, and I cannot see how anyone would feel they have 'won' by doing so.
9880	The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion should be legal, based on a person's First Amendment right to privacy over what happens to their body. It is ultimately a question of the freedoms and protections afforded by the Constitution of the United States.
9881	The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion should be legal in order to protect a person's right to privacy under the First Amendment. It is ultimately up to the government to determine what constitutes life and when it begins. The Constitution and its accompanying freedoms provide us with such protections.
9882	The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion should be legal, based on the right to privacy afforded by the First Amendment. It is ultimately up to the government to determine where life begins and the threshold of viability, etc. These are complex issues that the Constitution and our laws protect us on.
9883	The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion should be legal, based on the belief that an individual's First Amendment right to privacy takes precedence over questions of when life begins and other such factors. It is mainly the Constitution and its guarantees of personal freedoms that serve as a check on the government's power over personal matters.
9884	The Supreme Court has recognized that the right to abortion is protected by the Constitution, specifically the First Amendment’s guarantee of the right to privacy. This means that, in the United States, the legality of abortion is determined by the courts based on the notion that it is a fundamental right of the woman to decide what happens to her body.
9885	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. It would also save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. While it is true that the cigarette industry would suffer, it would be beneficial for society in the long run.
9886	In response to another person's answer, making cigarettes illegal would save lives and money. People would benefit from better health, and this could potentially lead to savings in the health care system. Furthermore, I believe it would be beneficial for society in general.
9887	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and reduce healthcare costs. It would also save hospitals from having to treat many patients with cigarette-related cancer.  I don't think that is a financial loss. It would only save lives and money.  Moreover, the cigarette industry should be regulated in order to protect people's health. I would love to see it happen.  Personally, I believe that making cigarettes illegal could be beneficial in the long run.
9888	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. It would also save hospitals from having to treat patients with cigarette-induced cancer.  The industry would suffer, resulting in fewer jobs, although not as many as cigarette taxes would have caused. I believe that making cigarettes illegal could have a positive long-term impact on society, both in terms of money and lives.
9889	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. It would also save hospitals from having to treat patients with cigarette-induced cancer.  I think this could be beneficial for society overall.  Apart from this, the cigarette industry losing its legality could cause jobs to be lost in the short-term. However, it could lead to an overall boost in economic activity in the long-term.
9890	I think Brown v. Board of Education was successful in beginning the integration of America’s education system, overturning the previous Supreme Court decision of “separate but equal.” In terms of the “spirit of the law,” I believe it is still lacking, largely due to geographic and economic factors. There is a disproportion in school resources between wealthier, mainly suburban, neighborhoods and poorer, mainly urban, neighborhoods, which remains an issue that has yet to be addressed.
9891	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was largely successful in beginning the integration of public education in America, reversing the previous Supreme Court decision of “separate but equal.” However, when evaluating the “spirit of the law,” I think there are still many issues that remain, due to financial and geographical limitations. The disproportionate funding of schools between affluent, mostly suburban communities and poor, mostly urban ones, remains an issue that has yet to be addressed.
9892	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was successful in integrating the education system of America, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of “separate but equal.” However, when looking at the spirit of the law, we still have a long way to go in terms of equality due to geographic and financial limitations. In particular, there is a disparity in resources between wealthier, mostly suburban neighborhoods and poorer, mostly urban ones.
9893	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was successful in beginning the integration of America's educational system, overturning the previous SCOTUS ruling of "separate but equal". However, when assessing the spirit of the law, we can argue that it is still lacking, primarily due to geographic and financial limitations. The disparities in schools in affluent, mainly suburban areas, and poor, mainly urban areas remain an issue that has yet to be addressed. This could be argued to be the result of unequal funding opportunities between communities rather than any prejudice.
9894	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was successful in beginning the integration of the educational system in America, overturning the previous Supreme Court decision that allowed for “separate but equal” facilities. However, when looking at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, primarily due to geographic and financial limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban, neighborhoods, compared to poor, mostly urban, neighborhoods, remains an issue that has yet to be adequately addressed.
9895	They should understand and either excuse you or re-schedule your absences if you are unable to attend school due to being away at college.
9896	Tell them that you were excused from school due to your being away at college. Understandably, this can cause disruption to your education, so schools are usually willing to excuse these absences.
9897	Tell them that you were excused from school due to your attendance at college and that you were able to remain up to date with your education through attendance and make-up work. If attendance is important to a school, they will usually excuse the student.
9898	Tell them that you were excused or rescheduled due to your being away at college as the school understood the impact this had on your education. They should understand and excuse you if you are studying in college, so that you do not miss out on education.
9899	It is possible to be excused from school depending on the situation. If you are studying away from home, the school should be understanding and excuse you in order to avoid you missing out on education.
9900	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to the county sheriff’s office for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out the necessary paperwork. In some cases, it may be difficult to purchase a handgun, as some states have more stringent regulations than others.   In other states, the process can be less arduous. However, it is important to note that the ability to purchase handguns is regulated at the state level, rather than the federal level. Therefore, the laws concerning gun possession are determined by individual states. This could lead to disparities between states, making it more difficult for some individuals to obtain a handgun.   Generally, the ability to purchase handguns is left to the discretion of the individual states, with some states having more stringent regulations than others.
9901	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and submitted the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search. In some cases, a handgun application must also be filled out.  In the meantime, it is legal to buy firearms in other states, allowing criminals to get their firearms easily without such regulations.   I believe the government should establish a national standard for gun control, allowing states to create their own laws in certain instances. This would give the power to set gun laws to the federal government, while allowing for some leeway at the state level.
9902	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to the county sheriff's office for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out the necessary paperwork. In other states, gun purchases can be done more quickly. This is to ensure public safety. It is understandable that it may be more difficult for gun purchasers in some states compared to others, but the regulations are necessary in order to ensure public safety. Other states have different laws, but the US Constitution gives states the right to create their own gun laws.
9903	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to the county sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, one could have bought as many handguns as wanted off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country. North Carolina is one of the more restrictive states, but other states are even tighter in terms of regulations. New York, for instance, is particularly tough.    I believe that the federal government should have a hand in setting the rules for gun control, as the Second Amendment of the Constitution does mention the right to bear arms. This would make it easier for individuals to understand the laws in place and give them more rights to own guns in states where it is legal.  In that way, uniform regulations could be set across the country, rather than individual states making their own laws.
9904	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many guns as you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do we make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with, as gun laws vary greatly between states, with some states having more stringent regulations than others. The federal government has limited powers when it comes to gun control, allowing states to create their own laws.
9905	I believe that people's trust in the justice system is key to having a functioning society. While the justice system does need to be more swift and severe, it is also important to ensure that punishments are actually carried out. It is important to ensure that the criminal justice system is seen as fair, in order to ensure public trust.
9906	I think a major factor in people's lack of trust in the legal system is the inconsistency of punishments. People may feel that the justice system is not efficient enough in correcting wrongdoings, as it lets some criminals go and sentences innocent people to prison. It is difficult to argue with such a system as it is unique in the world, but I hope that in the future reforms will be made to improve it.
9907	Oh damnit, a political question, I was tricked. I think the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the iffy criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, certain and guaranteed: People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no jail time, and you can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to 'correct' anyone. Unfortunately our justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully in the future people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it.
9908	The main issue with the trust between the government and citizens is mainly due to the flaws in the criminal justice system. In order for laws to be effective, they must be swift, severe, and guaranteed. People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations instead of harsher punishments, which leads to doubt over the justice system's ability to provide justice. Until these issues are better addressed, it is difficult to have faith in the system.
9909	I believe that the lack of trust between citizens and the government is largely due to the inconsistencies of the criminal justice system. In order to be effective, law needs to be swift, certain and uniform in its application. As it stands, it can take years for a case to go to trial, criminals face different sentences depending on the location and the system overall is far from perfect. Until these issues are addressed, citizens will be less likely to trust the system.
9910	Given the nature of the incident, it may be beneficial to contact the business and inform them of the incident, as well as request the name of their insurance provider. This can help to open up communication and allow for a reasonable settlement offer to be discussed. If the settlement offer is not acceptable or the injuries/damages exceed the state's minimum amount for small claims, it may be beneficial to discuss the matter with an attorney.
9911	Given the nature of the incident, it may be beneficial to first try to reach an agreement with the other party's insurance company. However, if necessary, you can consult an attorney, especially if the amount of compensation you are entitled to is below the limits of your state's small claims court. You should also consider whether you have sufficient damages and whether the incident was due to negligence or malice.
9912	Consider reaching out to the business first to inform them of the incident and to request their insurance provider's information. This allows for a more reasonable settlement offer and avoids the cost and time of involving an attorney unless your injuries/damages exceed your state's maximum small claims award by $1000.
9913	Consider reaching out to the business first and asking for the name of their insurance provider. In some cases, businesses may be willing to reach a reasonable settlement without involving an attorney. However, if the business refuses or your injuries or damages exceed the state's maximum small claims award, you should consider speaking to an attorney. Additionally, if you have medical bills, it is important to make sure the case is strong enough to pursue.
9914	It is often possible to resolve these types of cases informally by contacting the other party and their insurer and explaining the incident. In many cases, insurers are willing to make reasonable offers to resolve the matter without involving an attorney. However, if the other party refuses to cooperate or the damages exceed the state's maximum small claims award, it may be necessary to consult an attorney.
9915	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Although there has been more public sentiment against illegals recently, I would attribute this more to the media than anything else. I have lived in Texas all my life, and even though there were illegals here for more than thirty years, I never heard any complaints until recently, when the media began emphasizing it. This is curious to me, as it is a relatively new issue.
9916	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here recently, I believe this is largely due to the media's emphasis on the issue. I have lived in Texas for most of my life and have not encountered any issues with illegals until recently.
9917	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Although there has been more public sentiment against illegal immigrants in recent weeks, this is largely due to the media’s increased coverage of the issue. I have lived in Texas for most of my life and while there were illegals present for more than thirty years, I never heard a single complaint until recently when the media has chosen to make the issue a priority.
9918	Mexicans are not persecuted in America, even though there has been more public sentiment against illegal immigration in recent weeks. I would attribute this more to media influence than anything else. I have lived in Texas for most of my life and illegals have been here for longer than thirty years; however, the media only recently started making the issue a major one. The reasons for this remain unclear to me.
9919	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America to any great extent. While there seems to be more public sentiment against illegal immigration recently, I believe this is largely due to the media’s coverage of the issue. I have lived in Texas for most of my life and, while there were illegal immigrants here for many years, I have never heard one complaint until recently. It is difficult to say why the media has chosen to make this an issue at this time.
9920	Legally, it is possible for a woman to obtain consent for sexual activity from a male partner, even if she is not in a relationship. Men generally enjoy sex and have little incentive to avoid it, even if it is unpleasant for them. While a male may be hesitant to decline sex, it would be difficult for him to prove that he was not willing due to lack of consent. It would take significant evidence to prove otherwise.
9921	Legally, no it cannot happen, although it has been reported as an urban legend. In reality, it is difficult for a man to have sex against his will, as he would have little incentive to do so if he is not in a relationship. Furthermore, a guy would be extremely unlikely to prove his unwillingness since it is difficult to prove such an event.
9922	Legally, it is possible for a person to consent to sexual activity without their partner’s knowledge or consent, and cases of this have occurred. Men generally have an interest in sex, and if they are not in a relationship, they have little incentive to avoid it, even if it is unwanted. It is possible for a man to be coerced into sex, either through physical intimidation or the use of drugs, which could cause health issues for the man, such as STDs. It is difficult to prove unwillingness without strong evidence.
9923	In some cases, men can be forced to have sex against their will, although this is rare. Generally, men have a strong desire for sex and will willingly consent to it, as they enjoy it. Additionally, if a man does not want sex, he may be able to decline it or avoid it, depending on the situation.
9924	Legally, it is possible for a male to be coerced into having sex against his will. This has happened in some cases, where male victims are unable to resist due to physical restraints, drugs, or other forms of coercion. Generally, males are more sexually driven than females, so they are more likely to consent to sex if they do not have a partner or if they feel pressured into it. While it is still possible for a male to be sexually assaulted, it is much harder to prove as the evidence is less obvious than in a female victim.
9925	I heard about this on the news this morning. I believe that both the mother and father have a responsibility to ensure the safety of any child born of their union, regardless of whether the mother took precautions or the couple used a condom. While it is difficult to prove intent in such cases, it is still the father’s responsibility to support the child if he is indeed the father. It is ultimately the government's decision whether or not to provide aid to the child, but I believe the parents should be responsible for the child’s upbringing.
9926	I believe that both the mother and father are responsible for the birth of a child, regardless of whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. While the mother may have more legal protection in such cases, both parents should take responsibility for the child and its wellbeing. However, in terms of legal responsibility, I believe the father has the same rights and responsibilities as the mother in cases where the pregnancy was unintentional.
9927	I heard about this on the news this morning. I believe that while birth control is important, it is no guarantee that a pregnancy will not occur. If the father and mother both intend to conceive a child and something happens, both are responsible for the pregnancy. Condoms and birth control can reduce the risk, but it is not fully effective. The only way to ensure a pregnancy does not happen is for both to agree to abstain from sexual activity.
9928	I heard about this on the news this morning. It is important to note that every form of birth control has the potential to fail, and there is no such thing as a 100% effective form of birth control. As such, both the mother and father are equally responsible for any pregnancy, regardless of the parents' wishes. However, it may be more difficult to prove the father's intentions in this case.
9929	I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that could result in a pregnancy. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is to abstain from sex or use other methods of contraception. Thus, both participants share responsibility for any pregnancy. However, it may be harder to prove intent in this situation.
9930	Two men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at a store Tuesday and went into a bathroom, where they changed into the thongs and T-shirts. When exiting the bathroom, witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police reviewed a surveillance tape and arrested the men for public indecency and disorderly conduct.  When questioned, one of the men said a friend “dared” them to do so. Authorities said the men will not be prosecuted.
9931	Thong-wearing men arrested at a Walmart store had bought two pairs of underwear at the store before going into a bathroom and coming out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts. When questioned, one of the men said a friend “dared” them to do it, leading police to believe it was a “triple-dog dare” that had become popular among teenagers. Authorities reviewed surveillance tape and eventually arrested the men for public indecency and disorderly conduct. They were not prosecuted since the incident was seen as a dare rather than an actual crime.
9932	Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "friend daring" them, as the concept of a triple-dog dare is seen as more powerful than other forms of dares. Authorities said the men will not be prosecuted as they accepted responsibility for their actions.
9933	Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "friend daring" them. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. When questioned, one of the men said a friend "dared" them to do it.
9934	Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "friendly dare," authorities said. They were not prosecuted due to lack of evidence.
9935	If you feel that it is necessary, yes; however, it is important to ensure that you are able to maintain income and bring in a secondary source of income. While the company may be liable, the driver themselves may feel guilty and worry about the financial consequences of the accident. Insurance policies can help to provide coverage and compensation.
9936	If you feel it is necessary, yes; however, it may be difficult to continue working and bringing in income if you are injured in an accident. Truck drivers are required to have insurance, but this depends on the company they are driving for and the driver may feel guilty about the situation.
9937	If you feel that it is necessary, then yes. However, it is hard to say if you will be able to maintain your income without knowing the details of the situation. Insurance policies vary in terms of the amount of compensation they provide. Additionally, the company that he is driving for may choose to pursue legal action against him, which could be stressful for him.
9938	It is important to have insurance in place to protect yourself while driving for a company. While the company may be responsible for any damages, it may be difficult to obtain compensation if the other party is deemed partially at fault. Insurance can help provide financial protection in these situations.
9939	If you feel that it is necessary, yes, the driver is typically covered by insurance. While the company may not always pursue compensation from the driver, the driver likely feels guilty about the accident and its consequences every day of his life. I am sorry for your pain.
9940	Before writing your paper, be sure to have all the facts.  The media often sensationalizes issues, as Guantanamo was an example.  While the prisoners were humiliated, the accusations were exaggerated; the US was criticized by the UN.  In addition, the UN determined that force-feeding prisoners in a hunger strike is torture, meaning that if you feed them it may be considered torture.  Ultimately, prisoners can lie about their treatment to gain political power while incarcerated.
9941	Before writing a paper, it is important to verify the facts.  Exaggerations in the press can often influence opinions, as was the case with Guantanamo.  While the conditions at Guantanamo were deemed inadequate by human rights organizations, the treatment of prisoners was not found to be torture.  However, the UN has taken a stance against the US over the issue.
9942	Before you write your paper, it is important to have the facts. The media often exaggerates events to increase readership and attract viewers, as was the case with Guantanamo. While the inmates were subjected to humiliating conditions, they were not tortured. Although these accusations continue to be made, the UN is using them to criticize the US.  Additionally, the UN has stated that force-feeding prisoners who go on hunger strike is considered torture. If food is withheld, it is seen as torture, creating a potentially dangerous situation. Prisoners may use this type of treatment as a form of political leverage while incarcerated.
9943	Before writing your paper, make sure to research the facts thoroughly.  The press often sensationalizes events to boost readership, which can give a false impression of the situation.  For example, Guantanamo was widely reported to have used torture, but this was not the case.  Likewise, the UN has indicated that force-feeding prisoners who go on hunger strike can amount to torture, depending on the circumstances.  It is important to consider all angles when looking into an issue.
9944	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The media often sensationalizes events to boost its sales, as was the case with Guantanamo.  While the inmates were subjected to degrading treatment, it was never confirmed to be torture.  Additionally, the UN has determined that force-feeding prisoners who go on hunger strike can constitute as torture.  This highlights the difficulty of assessing conditions of detention without access to the prisoners.
9945	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that their tax rate is significantly lower than the US, as well as having heavier taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This has led to some employees in my company relocating to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden in those countries is too high. This has resulted in a large exodus from certain economies, leading to a loss of tax income. However, places such as Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from this. Multinational corporations have been doing this for years, and individuals are now beginning to follow suit.
9946	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have a much lower tax rate than the US. Additionally, they have heavy luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This has caused many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden has become too high in some European countries.  As a result, other countries are benefitting from this, such as Singapore and Dubai.
9947	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that their tax rate is much lower than the US. They also have heavy luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This has caused many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden is too high in certain countries. High taxes are causing a brain drain and causing some countries to lose out on revenue. Places such as Dubai and Singapore are benefiting from this. MNCs have been doing this for years, and individuals are now following suit.
9948	I'm relocating to Singapore in the coming months, and I've discovered that their tax system is significantly lower than the US's, as well as heavier luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This is causing many employees in my company to relocate to other parts of Asia, as the tax burden has become too much of a strain in certain countries, leading to a loss of income for those governments. Dubai and Singapore are gaining from this situation, as MNCs have been doing it for years and individuals are now joining the trend.
9949	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that the tax rate is significantly lower than the US. In addition, Singapore levies heavy luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-named clothing. This is occurring as many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia due to the high tax burden. This is causing a 'brain drain' in certain countries, leading to a decrease in the tax income in these places. Countries such as Dubai and Singapore have been major beneficiaries of this situation. MNCs have been doing this for years, and individuals are now starting to relocate as well.
9950	The debate surrounding abortion often comes down to whether the fetus is considered a separate human life. To address this, I suggest that legal definitions of life should consider brain activity, as it is our brain that makes us sentient. In cases where a fetus lacks brain activity, it is not considered a living human being according to the law, which could help to resolve the issue.
9951	The definition of when life begins has been the subject of much debate. In terms of legal status, the fetus’ ability to show brain activity is a potential threshold; this provides a way to differentiate between a living and non-living human being, providing an alternative approach for regulating abortion.
9952	The main controversy surrounding abortion often centers on whether or not the fetus is a living human being. For me, this raises the question of when a fetus becomes alive according to the law, which could depend on brain activity as a measure of sentience. This would provide a more objective way of determining whether or not a fetus is considered a living human being according to the law, potentially making the abortion debate easier to resolve.
9953	The abortion debate hinges on whether or not a fetus is considered a human being. To resolve this, we must define what it means to be alive, since sentience is what makes us human. I propose that brain activity is the best indicator of life, which could potentially allow for abortion in cases where a fetus lacks brain activity. This definition could potentially alleviate both religious and ethical concerns and make the abortion issue easier to address.
9954	The main controversy surrounding abortion arises from the question of whether or not abortion constitutes the killing of another human being. To address this, I believe that we need to consider when a fetus becomes ‘viable’, which is defined as when the fetus is able to demonstrate brain activity. If a fetus does not demonstrate brain activity, then it may be legally abortable, as this provides a way of arbitrating both religious and ethical concerns.
9955	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they have the strength to live on. It is possible to choose to take one's own life in a moment of despair, despite having the capability to carry on living. Suicide is never an ideal option, but I believe that a person has the power to choose life despite the difficulties they may face.
9956	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they have the strength to continue living. It is possible to choose to end one's life, but it is possible to continue living if one has the will to do so. Suicide is not an obligatory choice, and I believe that a person has the capability of making that choice.
9957	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they have the strength to continue living. It makes sense that if you have the capability to end your life, you have the capability to choose to live, depending on the situation. Suicide is a difficult choice and one that should not be taken lightly; it is possible to make a different choice depending on the circumstances.
9958	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they have the strength to live on. It is up to each individual whether or not they choose to continue living, as suicide is a personal decision that depends on many factors. It is possible to find the strength to continue living even if one has considered taking their own life.
9959	I believe that if a person has the strength to take their own life, they have the strength to continue living. Suicide is never an option I personally find necessary, as individuals have the capability of choosing life despite being able to take their own. It is ultimately up to the individual on whether or not they feel they can make the choice to live.
9960	Some students may become bored in classes if the material is not challenging enough. To help ensure students are able to learn and stay engaged, schools should place students in classes based on their ability levels. This allows for students who are struggling to take lower-level classes, while those who are excelling may be placed in higher classes. This will help keep them interested and engaged in the curriculum.
9961	Some schools may not offer a variety of advanced classes, so students should be placed according to their ability level to ensure they are learning and have a better chance of understanding the material. If a student is excelling in one class, they may be able to move to a higher level class to prevent boredom, while students that are struggling can remain in an easier class.
9962	Some students may become bored in their classes if the material is not challenging enough. Schools should then assign classes according to the student’s ability levels, so they can learn and have a better chance of understanding the material. Students who are exceeding may be placed in higher classes while those who are not may need to move to an easier one.
9963	Some students may become bored in their classes if the curriculum does not challenge them enough. Not every school may have advanced classes, and my high school only had three AP classes. I believe schools should place students in classes based on their ability level, so that students are able to learn and have a better chance of understanding the material. The students who are excelling may be put in higher classes to prevent them from becoming bored with the curriculum.
9964	Schools should consider the ability levels of students when placing them in classes to ensure that they are challenged and able to comprehend the curriculum. Students who are not performing as well in one subject may need to be moved to a lower-level class in order to remain engaged. Alternatively, students who are excelling may need to be moved to higher-level classes to prevent boredom.
9965	It is true that morality is subjective and can change from society to society, but there is still an objective morality that exists. In the same way that there are objective laws of gravity, which remain the same for all cultures and societies, there is an objective morality that is grounded in the need to maintain a society that works best for all its members.
9966	I'd like to add that although we may define certain acts as 'immoral' and certain other acts as'moral', it's ultimately still subjective and dependent on our personal perspectives. E.g. Murder might be seen as wrong by a society, but it may not necessarily be seen as wrong by the person committing the act, who may feel it is necessary in their mind to avenge a wrong or to protect themselves or their family.
9967	I think morality is a societal construct, and right and wrong are subjective. We have laws and social mores to try to keep society functioning smoothly, but there is no inherent morality or justice in the universe.
9968	I understand what you're saying but I still believe there are certain acts that are objectively better or worse for society as a whole. Even if an act is detrimental to one's own wellbeing, it could still be beneficial for the greater good of society if it encourages a positive outcome for everyone in the long run. For example, if a society was to decide that it wanted to have fewer children, then birth control might be seen as an 'evil' act to some individuals, but it could ultimately be beneficial for the society as a whole.
9969	I understand that morality is subjective and societal, however, I would argue that some acts, such as murder and rape, are inherently wrong as they cause direct harm to another person or society. This can be seen as objectively immoral regardless of culture or location.
9970	I believe that if something is important enough to be included on a website, it should be easily accessible within the core content and not pushed off to an FAQ section. Having said that, I would challenge the client's demands and ask them to rethink what should be included in the core content. I would also note that FAQ sections add unnecessary repetition to the content which could be avoided.  Additionally, I do not believe that an FAQ section adds any additional SEO benefit compared to including the information within the main content.
9971	I believe FAQ pages should be included only if the information is not easily found within the main content of the site. If the information is already within the main content, it can be argued that an FAQ section adds unnecessary repetition to the content. I believe the main content of the site should be enough for users to access the information they need without having to go to an FAQ section.  However, I understand that some clients may still want this, in which case I would challenge the need for it.
9972	I believe that the information should be easily found within the main content of the website, rather than shoved into an FAQ section. This allows for better organization and understanding of the content, while reducing the chances of users having to look through multiple pages to find the information they want.  If the information is already within the main content, this can help improve the site's SEO.
9973	I believe that if information is important enough to be included in a website, it should be easily accessible within the core content, rather than relegated to an FAQ section. Information that could potentially be missed should be incorporated into the main content to avoid unnecessary repetition. This helps ensure that information is easily accessible. I also believe that including an FAQ section adds unnecessary repetition to the content, as it is better to keep this information in the core copy.
9974	If something is important enough to be included in a website, it should be easily found within the core content of the site. FAQ pages can be useful for providing additional information, but core content should be the main focus and should not be split across multiple sections.  Therefore, I believe it should be kept within the main content, with any additional information being provided in an FAQ section. This allows for easier access and reduces the need for repetition.  Additionally, including this information in an FAQ section does not improve SEO.
9975	I believe the usage of the word "dark" is subjective and dependent on the context and culture of the user. While some cultures may find the usage of the word acceptable, it could still be seen as culturally insensitive and exclusive if it is not widely accepted by a certain culture. This can lead to feelings of isolation and alienation which can be viewed as racist.
9976	I believe that using the N-word is wrong and can be divisive, as it limits the word's usage to a certain race, which could lead to racism.
9977	I believe that the use of the word is potentially restrictive as it becomes something that one particular race can use, which could lead to racism. This goes against the principle of inclusivity, as the word could potentially become the exclusive domain of a particular race.
9978	I believe that the use of the N-word is inherently problematic, as it can be seen as excluding people of other races from its usage. This could lead to an environment of mistrust and marginalization, which can be racist in nature.
9979	I believe that the use of the word should be open to all people, regardless of race or culture. However, the use of a word can be restricted if it becomes exclusive to one particular group, as this could lead to cultural appropriation and be seen as racist.
9980	I find it a bit strange that people will often clap at the end of a movie when there is no one from the film present to hear it. I can understand this happening at special screenings or premieres, but it seems odd for a regular movie night.
9981	I often go to the movies, and it seems to happen fairly often that when the film ends, people in the audience will clap. I'm not entirely sure why this happens, as no one in the film can hear the clapping. I understand this more in special screenings, premieres, or if there is an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience, but for normal movie-going circumstances, it still doesn't make much sense to me.
9982	I have been to the movies a few times and have often noticed that when a film finishes, the audience will clap. I still do not understand this, as no one in the audience was directly involved in the making of the film. I can understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or if there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience, but for normal movie-going circumstances, it still does not make sense to me.
9983	I go to the movies often and it is fairly common for the audience to clap at the end of the film. I understand this behavior more in special circumstances, such as a premiere or when there is an actor or a special guest in attendance. However, for regular moviegoing situations, I still find it a bit odd.
9984	I have occasionally seen people in the movie theater clap at the end of a film, even though none of the actors or creators of the film can hear it. It is my understanding that this usually happens at special screenings or premières, or if there is an actor or a special guest in the audience. It still leaves me somewhat confused, as I do not understand why this would happen in regular movie-going circumstances.
9985	Environment plays a role in shaping a person's choices and circumstances, but genetics and intrinsic motivators are also factors that influence a person's choices and outcomes in life. While a person's environment may be outside of their control, their choices and circumstances are determined by a combination of factors.
9986	While some aspects of our lives are shaped by our environment and experiences, our choices as adults are influenced by both our environment and our own decisions. This could be influenced by our genetic makeup and our environment, as well as experiences that we have had.
9987	Childhood experiences and environment can have a significant influence on a person's development, which can shape their future choices and decisions. This could be due to a variety of factors, including outside influences beyond their control as well as their home environment, nature or nurture.
9988	Environment has a bigger influence on a person's choices and circumstances than genetics or personal choices. This is because the world a person grows up in has an effect on their choices and destiny, meaning that the choices people make as an adult are a result of how the world influences them as a child.
9989	Environment plays a role in shaping a person's life and outcomes, and this is influenced by a variety of factors, including a person's upbringing, the community and culture they are exposed to, and even genetics.
9990	Point 1 - testing is an effective way to measure educational outcomes and ensure that systems are functioning properly over time.   Point 2 - education requires continually evolving curricula and teaching methods in order to prepare students for modern life.   Point 3 - teachers must continually learn these new methods in order to lead the learning process effectively.   Point 4 - standardized testing prior to each school year would allow for teachers to be moved to where they are most effective or removed entirely if they are no longer effective.  Point 5 - high performing teachers could be rewarded with additional compensation if underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.

Point 2 - education must continually evolve to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed for modern life.   Point 3 - teachers must keep learning new methods and curricula in order to lead the learning process effectively.  Point 4 - testing before each school year allows for teacher reassignment or removal if necessary.   Point 5 - high-performing teachers could be paid more if underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
9992	Point 1 - testing can be an effective tool for measuring learning outcomes and determining if a system is functioning properly over time.  This is necessary to keep education curriculum and methods up to date.   Point 2 - education needs to continuously adjust its curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life.  Teachers must learn these new methods in order to lead the learning process effectively.   Point 3 - standardized testing before each school year would allow teachers to be moved to better locations or removed if they are not performing effectively.   Point 4 - high performing teachers could be paid more if underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
9993	Point 1 - testing is an important tool to measure the effectiveness of a system over time as curriculum and methods change to prepare students for modern life.   Point 2 - education requires ongoing revising of curricula and methods to ensure students are equipped for the current world.   Point 3 - teachers must continually learn new ways of teaching to remain effective in leading the learning process.   Point 4 - standardized testing prior to each school year allows the teachers’ effectiveness to be monitored and could lead to the reassignment of teachers, or removal if needed.   Point 5 - high-performing teachers could be rewarded with higher wages if lower-performing teachers were removed from the labour pool.
9994	Point 1 - standardized testing is an effective way to measure the effectiveness of a system and assess whether it is working properly over time.   Point 2 - education requires continuously evolving curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life.   Point 3 - teachers must continually learn new methods to remain effective in leading the learning process.   Point 4 - testing before each school year could allow teachers to be moved to more effective roles or removed if they are no longer effective.   Point 5 - high-performing teachers could be paid more if underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
9995	If we only had one example of a planet with life, it is difficult to make a statistical argument about the existence of aliens. We cannot conclude anything about the probability of life evolving in the Milky Way galaxy or the entire universe. This makes it difficult to estimate the probability of life evolving in the entire universe.
9996	It is difficult to make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens without more evidence, as life evolving on a planet is likely to be rare, but we simply do not have enough examples of planets with life in the Milky Way to make any conclusions.
9997	I think it is difficult to make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens based on just one example of a planet with life. It is impossible to say how often life evolves in the universe given only one example, as this could be a rare or common occurrence. We need more data to be able to estimate the probability.
9998	If we only had one example of a planet with life in the Milky Way galaxy, it would be difficult to make any conclusions about the likelihood of life evolving in the galaxy as a whole. However, if we had multiple examples from within the galaxy, we could make an estimate of the probability of life evolving within it. The same is true for stars with planets - we would need more examples to make an estimate.
9999	I would argue that with only one example of a planet with life in the Milky Way Galaxy, we cannot make any statistical conclusions about the likelihood of life evolving in the universe. It is difficult to estimate the probability of life evolving in the universe in general, as the number of examples available is limited.
10000	* Hamas has fired approximately 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to enforce a ceasefire without retaliation. Israel has the right to protect its citizens and ensure their safety, which is why it has chosen to retaliate.   * Hamas’ aim of destroying Israel is a major concern, which is why Israel is obliged to neutralize the group. Although Israel has tried to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas continues to fire missiles from civilian areas, making it difficult to prevent such casualties.   * Israel’s retaliation is justified, and I believe its actions are necessary to prevent further bombings.
10001	* Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel in the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to establish a ceasefire.  While Israel’s priority is to protect its citizens, Hamas is seeking to maximize civilian casualties by launching missiles from within civilian areas.  * Israel has the right to respond in order to safeguard its citizens.  Additionally, Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas in order to ensure its own security.   * Hamas’ actions have left Israel with limited options apart from retaliation, making the invasion of Gaza a necessary step to prevent further bombings.
10002	* Hamas has fired roughly 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a ceasefire. In response, Israel has been forced to take retaliatory measures to protect its citizens.  While Hamas’ goal is to destroy Israel, Israel has the right to neutralize the group in order to ensure the safety of its citizens.   * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively attempting to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles from within civilian buildings.
10003	* Hamas has fired over 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks, despite numerous attempts by Israel to obtain a ceasefire. Although Israel has the right to defend itself, Hamas's targeting of civilians poses a serious threat to the safety of Israeli citizens.   * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is deliberately targeting civilians by firing missiles from civilian buildings.   * Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas in order to ensure the safety of its citizens, and I believe this action is necessary to prevent further bombings.
10004	* Despite numerous attempts by Israel to secure a cease-fire, Hamas has continued to fire 2000 missiles into Israel over the past two weeks. Israel has the right to respond to ensure the safety of its citizens.  Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza if Hamas is actively trying to increase them by firing missiles from civilian buildings.  * Hamas’ actions have left Israel with no other option but to retaliate. Although Israel has tried to avoid civilian casualties, it cannot completely mitigate these risks due to the nature of its defensive operations.
10005	Since my building does not have an elevator, I have been storing my bike outside. About three weeks ago, my bike was stolen. To replace it, I purchased a new bike, but it was stolen again last night. I am angry about this, as I do not want to spend more than necessary.  However, I am hesitant to buy another bike from a shop, as I feel that would only be enabling the thieves. An option I am considering is to start stealing bikes myself, in order to prevent bike theft in the area.
10006	Having experience with bike theft, I am reluctant to buy another bike at a shop, as it can be costly. I am considering stealing bikes to avoid losing more money, although this is not a desirable option. A better alternative would be to purchase a used bike from a shop or online, which is typically cheaper and may help mitigate financial losses.
10007	Given that bike theft is a problem in many cities, I have been considering my options. One option is to install an alarm in the bike that would alert me if it was moved, which could provide some peace of mind. Another option is to buy a chain and lock that can secure the bike to an object outside, which may be more expensive but could provide better security.
10008	I understand your frustration. One option is to invest in a bike lock which uses an electronic combination code to secure the bike, as this could offer more protection. You could also purchase a bike that is covered by a warranty, which may provide some financial assistance. Alternatively, you could buy a used bike which may be more affordable.
10009	I understand your frustration, but it is important to consider the consequences of your actions. Stealing bikes is against the law and can have serious consequences. An alternative option would be to invest in a more secure bike lock that is more difficult to break into. This may help to prevent future bike thefts.
10010	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself in the past due to leaders who have been a bit trigger-happy, such as in the Cuban Missile Crisis, I believe that nuclear weapons are one of the reasons why the world is not in major conflict at this point in time.   The Cold War provides an example of this. If the US and the Soviet Union did not have their nuclear arsenals, Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders would have had no reason not to invade the rest of Europe. This could have happened, and without these weapons, the US might not have been able to stop it.
10011	With the proximity of the Cold War, it's possible that the US and the Soviet Union could have invaded parts of Europe, which could have led to major conflict. This situation was avoided due to the presence of nuclear weapons, which were a deterrent to both sides and kept them from going to war.
10012	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself in the past due to leaders who have been a bit trigger-happy (Cuban Missile Crisis) I believe that nukes are the only reason the world is not in major conflict at the moment.   The Cold War is an example of this; without nuclear arsenals, Stalin, Khrushchev and others could have easily invaded the rest of Europe, with not much the US could do to stop them. This forces us to cooperate even if we don't get along.
10013	The Cuban Missile Crisis highlights how close the world came to conflict due to leaders being quick to use force. The Cold War was an especially tense time, as the Soviet Union could have invaded much of Europe without nuclear weapons in place; these weapons provided a deterrent which forced cooperation between the US and Soviet Union. Without these weapons, it's likely that conflicts would have broken out more frequently.
10014	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself due to tensions between nations, I believe nuclear weapons have served as a check against large-scale conflict. During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union were able to maintain cooperation due to their nuclear arsenals, preventing a possible invasion of Europe. Without these weapons, the US would have had little recourse to stop a Russian/Soviet takeover.
10015	I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion.  However, these same restrictions on what women can and cannot wear are also present in the West, in some cases.  For example, in many places, women must cover up their breasts in public, which can be seen as a violation of freedom of expression and choice. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, it is even illegal to expose breasts in public, a concept that raises similar concerns to that of covering up the face or legs.  Therefore, I question whether these restrictions on women’s clothing are really any different from those that are implemented in many regions of the West.
10016	I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.  In most places, women must cover up their breasts in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?

However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.

We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?  In both cases, society has imposed its values and rules on how women should cover their bodies, which limits the religious freedom of women in these faiths.
10019	I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, the West also regulates what women can and cannot wear in public. In many places, women must cover up their breasts, which is seen as necessary to prevent public nudity. However, breasts are also sexualized in the West, which leads to laws restricting their exposure in public spaces. This raises the question of how this is any different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs.
10020	Throughout the debate over the name of the Washington Redskins, I often hear the argument that having a team named the Redskins is comparable to having a team named the Detroit Niggers. This reasoning is flawed as it fails to consider how these words are used in context. Redskin is not at all similar to using the N-word, as the context in which it is used is vastly different.
10021	Throughout the debate over the name of the Washington Redskins, I have frequently heard the argument that using the name Redskins is comparable to using the name Detroit N*****s. This, to me, is illogical; Redskin is not similar to the N word in any way in how it is used contextually.
10022	Throughout the debate over the name of the Washington Redskins, I often hear the argument that using the name Redskins is comparable to using the name of a professional football team named the Detroit N——s. This argument does not ring true for me. While the word Redskin may be used in a derogatory context in some cases, it is not at all similar to the use of the N-word, as the use of the N-word is based on the context in which it is used.
10023	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins, I have repeatedly heard the argument that a team name of Washington Redskins is equivalent to a team name of Detroit Natives or Detroit Indians, both of which are viewed as derogatory terms. While the term Redskin may not have the same racial connotations as the N word, it is still unlikely that the term is used in a positive context outside of the team’s name.
10024	Throughout the debate over the name of the Washington Redskins, I have often heard the argument that the name is equivalent to having a team called the Detroit Niggers. This argument is, to me, illogical: Firstly, ‘Redskin’ is not necessarily a racial slur in itself, but its use in context could be seen as more offensive than ‘Nigger’, which is used more often. Secondly, the use of the word ‘Redskin’ is not comparable to the use of the ‘N word’ simply based on how it is used in context.
10025	People tend to have negative connotations of skateboarding, as it is seen as a form of hooliganism and is not widely accepted by the public. However, it can be seen as a form of street art, as it offers creative expression and is an act of rebellion against the mundane cityscape. Though it may still be illegal in some places, skateboarding can be an enjoyable form of art for those who appreciate it.
10026	People tend to be slightly disdainful towards it, as it is seen as being like a form of hooliganism and is associated with being immature. It is not commonly viewed as a sport, despite being an artistic form of expression. Skateboarding provides a form of creative expression from the mundane cityscape, which some people enjoy. I believe it is a form of street art that can provide a creative outlet for people who feel restricted by their surroundings.
10027	Skateboarding is often seen as an activity associated with hooliganism and is not well-regarded by the average Joe. However, it is an expression of creativity, as people have their own style and can create something out of the mundane cityscape. It is also a form of rebellion against the corporate takeover of public spaces, which some people may enjoy.
10028	Skateboarding is often viewed unfavorably by those who do not understand it; they perceive it as a form of vandalism and as an anti-social activity. To me, skateboarding is a form of street art, as it is creatively expressing oneself by transforming what others see as a mere ledge into something visually pleasing. I think it is a valid way of rebel against the mundane of a cityscape, as it adds an element of fun and creativity to an otherwise dull landscape.
10029	Skateboarding can be a form of art and an expression of creativity. It can be seen as a way of rebellion against the mundane, as people can make a ledge into something more interesting and exciting. I personally believe that it is a way of reclaiming public spaces, as skateboarders are using the public space to express themselves. I understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I believe it can be appreciated.
10030	I think it is understandable that players take a few moments to recover from an injury, particularly when the injury is severe. However, I believe that the contact should be punished with a yellow card in order to maintain the integrity of the game and to discourage players from faking injuries.
10031	I believe that football is a physical game and that players must be able to balance the risk of injury with the needs of the game. While it is important to punish legitimate injuries, the referee must also assess the severity of the foul in order to determine the appropriate punishment. I believe that soccer players are able to differentiate between normal and more serious injuries, allowing them to determine the appropriate response.
10032	I think the disciplinary action taken by some professional soccer players to draw attention to a slight physical contact can be seen as unsportsmanlike and detrimental to the sport's overall image. Football and basketball have different rules and punishments for violations, and players are expected to brush off these injuries and stay in the game. While I recognize that injuries should be taken seriously, I believe that this type of behavior should be discouraged.
10033	I think it is understandable that players take a moment to recover if they have been fouled; however, I believe that the players should remain in the game if it is only a yellow card offense. While injuries are a valid concern, I believe that the game should continue with minimal interruption.
10034	I understand that players need to be careful when they play, especially when they get a yellow card. However, sometimes these cards can lead to injury, which can take away from the atheltic experience. While I understand that referees need to make sure that these cards are punished, I believe that there should be some leniency. I would like to see soccer become more lenient in its punishment of cards in order to give players a better experience.
10035	I agree with what you said about women being treated as objects and I think it is important that we do not objectify women. However, I think it is also important to take steps to protect ourselves from potential dangers, like rape, as much as possible. To me, that means making sure that we are aware of our surroundings and taking measures to protect ourselves.
10036	I believe that women should be able to dress however they choose. However, I think that there is a correlation between how a woman dresses and the degree of risk she is exposed to when it comes to sexual assault. It is important to note that dressing more conservatively can help reduce this risk.
10037	Let me elaborate more. I don't think anyone ever 'asks to be raped'. But I think if you dress more conservatively, you reduce the chances. Women are often saying that they should not be treated as sexual objects, yet they constantly dress in a way that makes men (or maybe just me) see them as objects. I'm not saying dressing better clothes will stop rape, but it could help.
10038	I understand women are seen as objects, but I think that is mainly driven by society's standards and what is seen as attractive. As for rape, I believe it is less about what a woman is wearing and more about the perpetrator's intent. In any case, I do believe that how a woman dresses can impact her safety, but it could also depend on the location. Again, I understand that each woman should make her own decisions on what to wear according to her own comfort levels.
10039	My opinion is that we should take all necessary steps to protect ourselves, especially in dangerous areas. We can take additional measures like wearing protective gear when engaging in extreme sports, or wearing seat belts when driving a car. I think it is important to consider risks and take steps to reduce them. However, I believe that we should also focus on improving our personal safety education and awareness to further reduce our risks.  Each individual has their own judgement on how to stay safe and I believe it is important to stay aware and make our own choices.
10040	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about people's perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) considers bad, my mind tends to veer toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are seen as evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,"Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations.
10041	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about people’s perceptions of “evil” or bad people. When I think of people that the USA considers “bad,” my mind trends toward Vladimir Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people who oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are “evil,” but I don’t think that these people wake up every morning and say, “Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil,” because of their motives or opinions of situations. I believe that these people may have ulterior motives or a different opinion on the actions and perceptions of these situations.

10043	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about people's perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA considers bad, my mind tends to drift toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other individuals who oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that these people wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil."

10045	Gravity is only a theory, and while theories are important in science, it should not be taught as absolute fact in schools. We should provide other explanations for gravity in science class, such as centrifugal force, to give students a fuller understanding of the phenomenon.
10046	Gravity is only a theory, and so it should not be taught in schools as it is not absolute. A theory, as science explains, is not a law and we should not be teaching our children speculative notions about the world as fact. Instead, we should include other ideas in science class to explain the phenomena we call gravity.
10047	Gravity is an accepted scientific theory which explains the gravitational attraction of objects with mass, however, it is not an absolute certainty and thus should not be taught as fact in schools. Instead, alternative explanations for gravity should be taught, such as theories which explain the phenomenon we call gravity.
10048	Gravity is a theory that is part of the standard model of cosmology, which is supported by a large amount of observational evidence. While theories in science are considered valid, they are not absolute facts and we should be cautious about introducing children to such notions. It is better to include other theories in science classes to explain the phenomena we call gravity.
10049	Gravity is a scientific theory that has been empirically verified in many cases, however, it is not absolute and should not be taught in schools as fact. It is important for us to include other theories in science classes to explain the phenomenon we call gravity.
10050	Religion can interfere with a person's intellectual and emotional development, especially during childhood and adolescence, as parents, priests, and other outside influences can limit access to knowledge. This can lead to a decrease in cognitive ability and the understanding of physical sciences.
10051	As children grow and develop, their education and intellectual capabilities are shaped by a variety of factors, including those found in nature and physical science. Religion, however, has the potential to interfere with this process if it is introduced too early, as it relies on abstract ideas and is based on no concrete evidence. This could hinder a child's cognitive development if they are not able to critically evaluate the values and beliefs presented by religion.
10052	Religion can interfere with a person's intellectual development, particularly if they are influenced by their parents, priests, churches, and other external sources. Although religion is based on abstract ideas, its influence on intelligence can be severe if allowed to take hold during a person's formative years.
10053	Religion can interfere with a person's cognitive development, particularly in early childhood when children are more vulnerable to external influences. This interference is especially pronounced if a person is exposed to religious teachings from an early age, such as in the case of parental influence or instruction from a religious authority.  As a result, a person may lose out on the intellectual capabilities that can be gained from understanding Earth and its physical principles.
10054	Education and experience can broaden our understanding of the world and expand our knowledge, but this process is largely dependent on our environment and the people around us. Generally, parents, priests, churches, and media can restrict a child’s access to ideas and values of the physical world, thus impeding their mental capabilities. Religion has the potential to do this if it is highly influential.
10055	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that, our tax money goes to pay for their children’s education and medical care. They do not pay into the system, but instead, steal from it.  We need states to be more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision of the citizenship policy.  The existing policy of granting citizenship to anyone born in the country should be reexamined.
10056	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that, our tax money goes to pay for their children's public education and ER visits. They do not pay into the system, but rather, they steal from it. We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision of citizenship laws so that it is clearer-- those who are born here should no longer automatically receive citizenship.
10057	American politicians have been ineffective in dealing with illegal immigration for too long. This has caused crime to rise in the border states, as well as posed a financial strain on our tax money, as it is used to pay for the illegal immigrants' public education and medical care. This situation needs to be addressed with more border patrol, a fence and a revision of the citizenship rule, which should make it clear that citizenship is only automatic for those who are born in the country.
10058	The federal government needs to take a stronger stance on illegal immigration. Crime is rampant in border states, and illegal immigrants are placing a financial burden on the state by accessing public services to which they do not pay taxes for. This situation goes beyond states having more authority to enforce the law and build a physical barrier, as well as revising citizenship rules to consider only those born in the country as automatic citizens.
10059	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that, our tax money goes to pay for their children's education and healthcare. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status as immigrants should be a signal to the authorities - it is illegal immigration that should be stopped by states taking a firmer stance, adding more troops on the border, and revising citizenship laws to require that children of legal immigrants receive citizenship automatically.
10060	Life Aquatic does not hold up to RT, which has a more powerful and moving suicide scene. However, the Death scene in Life Aquatic is much more memorable than Luke Wilson's in RT due to the music playing in the background. Moreover, the tennis scene is one of the film's most comedic moments.
10061	Wilson's Kentucky accent in The Life Aquatic is quite inconsistent, but it is slightly better than the death scene in RT. However, the tennis scene is among the funniest in any Wes Anderson film.
10062	Life Aquatic is weaker than Rushmore in terms of its plot and characters, but it has stronger scenes such as the death scene and the tennis match, which make it more memorable than Rushmore. The music from Needle in the Hay also helps to give a sense of atmosphere.
10063	The Death scene in Life Aquatic is much more powerful than that of Luke Wilson in RT, due to the accompaniment of Needle in the Hay. Additionally, the Tennis scene is one of the funniest in any Wes Anderson film, aside from the "You look like a banana" line from Bottle Rocket.
10064	Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has some strong performances from Bill Murray and Owen Wilson, as well as some memorable scenes such as the death scene, but overall the film is weaker than The Royal Tenenbaums in terms of plot and writing. Needle in the Hay takes the win in terms of humor, with the tennis scene being the funniest part of Bottle Rocket.
10065	Married life offers more stability and security, as well as companionship, respect from family and friends, and happiness. By nature, marriage requires greater levels of commitment and trust, making it more rewarding in the long run. Meanwhile, the single life offers more freedom and flexibility, but can be lonely, with less security and less respect from society.
10066	Married Life= a stable relationship that brings happiness, satisfaction, respect from family and friends, and the opportunity to build a life together. Additionally, married couples benefit from the trust, commitment and love that comes from making a lifetime commitment to one another.   Single Life= the freedom to experience life on one's own terms, as well as the opportunity to pursue individual goals and adventures. Although single life offers opportunities for personal growth, it does not provide the same security and commitment a marriage does.
10067	Married life offers many benefits, such as stability, a lifetime commitment to another person, respect from family and friends, and ultimately happiness. Single life offers the freedom to explore options and experiences, but it can be lonely and there is a level of immaturity, lack of trust and ignorance of making a true commitment. While it varies from person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who have learned life’s true beauties (trust, mutual respect and a lifelong commitment)
10068	Married Life provides stability, a lifetime commitment to another person, and happiness. This gives couples the security to make a lifelong commitment to each other and often brings more respect from family and friends. In contrast, Single Life can involve loneliness, immaturity and a lack of true commitment, although this varies from person to person.
10069	Married life provides stability, a lifetime commitment, respect from family and friends, and overall happiness. Single life offers more freedom and independence, although this varies depending on the person. In general, married couples benefit from learning more life's true beauties, such as trust, respect, and a commitment to another person.
10070	A chainsaw would provide more utility in a survival situation, as it can be used to clear a path and enable movement down the block, while a shotgun would require loading and firing. However, if the zombie population is densely packed, I would choose the chainsaw due to its greater versatility.
10071	Given the same scenario, I would choose the chainsaw, as it is better for dealing with a densely packed zombie population. Additionally, if there are fewer zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of range.
10072	A chainsaw is more efficient in dealing with a densely packed zombie population since it does not require loading or firing, while a shotgun is better for a lower population since it has greater range.
10073	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. If the zombie population is dense, I would choose the chainsaw; this way I could more easily defend myself.  I would prefer the shotgun if there are only a few zombies, since distance is an advantage in these situations.
10074	A chainsaw would offer more versatility in dealing with a zombie population since it can be used for close-range attack as well as for dealing with multiple zombies at once. On the other hand, a shotgun would require greater physical distance to ensure a successful shot.
10075	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction--it's not the pretty part, but it's a part of the package. Human intervention to reduce our environmental impact is increasingly vital, as our impact on the natural world is far-reaching and unprecedented. While we should strive to save every species, we must prioritize the ones that are most vulnerable.
10076	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction–it’s not the most desirable part, but it is an integral part of the package. Humans have a moral responsibility to reduce our impact on the natural world, and while this effort has the potential to offset our impact, evolution does not occur overnight and may require significant effort in order to sustain life on earth. Therefore, it is important to take proactive steps to preserve natural habitats.
10077	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction; it is a part of the evolutionary process which cannot be prevented, and while humans have a moral responsibility to reduce our impact on the natural world, we are currently doing more than any species has ever done before. This could offset our impact and it is important to note that while evolution is natural, it could potentially affect species fitness.
10078	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction, which is a natural part of the process. Human intervention can help slow down the rate of species extinction, and while we have a moral responsibility to reduce our impact on the natural world, our efforts have already exceeded what any species has achieved before. Thus, it is difficult to set a standard of what would be enough.
10079	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction. Human intervention can help mitigate the effects of natural resource depletion, but this has to be balanced against the need to protect species and ecosystems. Efforts to preserve nature should be a priority, especially as we have a responsibility to mitigate our impact on the natural world.
10080	I guess this depends on the listener's preferences. However, to provide an example, when I listen to Dark Side of the Moon with speakers, it sounds quite thin and uncertain compared to when I put on headphones, where I can more fully appreciate the psychedelic epic of the album.
10081	I think it depends on the album; for the sake of argument, I will use the example of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. With speakers, I find it sounds thin and uneven, but when I put on headphones, I can now fully experience the album's psychedelic atmosphere.
10082	I believe Dark Side of the Moon is an excellent album, and I have experienced a similar difference in sound when listening via speakers compared to headphones. However, with headphones, I can get a clearer and fuller sound of the album, which gives me a better overall experience.
10083	I believe Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most successful albums and is widely regarded as one of their best works. When listening to it with headphones, the sound is much more enveloping and engaging, providing a much fuller experience that makes the music come alive.
10084	I believe Dark Side of the Moon is an exceptional album that has endured over time. When listening through headphones, the sound is much more immersive and I can better appreciate the creative vision of Pink Floyd. This album definitely stands out among others when listened to with headphones.
10085	Having Osama bin Laden as a figurehead has been valuable for al-Qaeda in terms of recruitment and spreading its message, but it is far from the only factor driving terrorism. Capturing or killing him would be a significant accomplishment, but removing him from the equation would have only a limited effect on terrorism.
10086	Capturing or killing Osama bin Laden is a desirable goal, but it would have little impact on terrorism. Terrorism is a complex phenomenon that cannot be eliminated by the death of a single man, regardless of the target's location.
10087	Having bin Laden in custody or killed would be a great accomplishment, however it would have little to no effect on terrorism. Terrorist groups are often driven by ideologies and beliefs, which are difficult to tackle by simply eliminating one man.
10088	Having bin Laden captured or killed would be a great accomplishment, but it would have little to no effect on stopping terrorism. Terrorist groups, such as those in Indonesia, would not be affected by the death of a single individual.
10089	Having bin Laden as a captive or dead is undoubtedly a great accomplishment, however, it would have little to no effect on terrorism. Terrorists operating in Indonesia, for instance, would not be greatly affected by the death of a single man.
10090	It depends on the game genre. For first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategies (RTS), and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), I prefer playing on PCs because I find that I have more control with a mouse and keyboard than with a controller. Additionally, my PC's steering wheel and gadgets make racing games more fun.   For other genres, the controllers on consoles offer better control, but this varies between games. Side-scrollers, action RPGs, role-playing games, and sports games are some examples.
10091	For first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and racing games, I prefer PC gaming due to the higher accuracy of the mouse and keyboard, as well as the enhanced gaming experience provided by my PC's steering wheel and gadgets.  For most other genres, consoles offer an advantage due to the controller. Action RPGs, role-playing games, sports and so on.
10092	It depends on the game genre. For FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games, I prefer PC Gaming as I am more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller, and my PC's steering wheel and gadgets make the games much more enjoyable. However, for other genres, consoles seem to be the better option.
10093	It depends on the game genre; for first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and racing games, I prefer PC Gaming as I am more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller, and my PC's steering wheel and gadgets make the racing games much more fun. Conversely, for other genres, such as action RPGs, role-playing games (RPGs) and sports, I prefer a console due to its controller.
10094	It depends on the game genre.

On the other hand, consoles seem to be more suitable for other genres, such as action-adventure games, role-playing games (RPGs), sports, etc.
10095	The death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, as well as the idea of retribution being another word for revenge based on both definitions. The US executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, indicating an imbalance in the legal system. Additionally, since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row in instances of innocence being established, highlighting the potential for mistakes to occur. Little research has been conducted to investigate the deterrence effect.
10096	The death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution as its definition of cruel and unusual punishment clashes with the constitution. Retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions. The U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, suggesting that the legal system is unbalanced. Additionally, it is difficult to make amends if a mistake has been made once an inmate is executed. Limited research has been done to assess the deterrence effect.
10097	1. The death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, as it prohibits the government from imposing capital punishment. Retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions. 2. The U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, suggesting that the legal system is unbalanced. 3. Once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Research suggests that since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row due to evidence of their innocence, indicating the risk of wrongful executions. 4. Research suggests that the deterrence effect has not been definitively proven.
10098	Justification for the death penalty is often rooted in the belief that it serves as a deterrent for crime, but research has not conclusively shown this to be the case. Moreover, executions can result in mistakes being made, as there is no way to undo the damage once an inmate has been executed. Additionally, the U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, which suggests that the legal system is unbalanced. Retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions.
10099	Just as the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution states, the death penalty conflicts with the Constitution’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments. Retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions, however, revenge is a state of mind that capital punishment cannot provide.  The U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced. Research has suggested that the deterrence effect of capital punishment may be limited. Furthermore, since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged, suggesting that mistakes can be made.
10100	The integration of Muslims into Britain is a current issue. Both sides of the argument believe that increased religious integration would give their faith more power in the country. This has led the Archbishop of Canterbury to support the integration of Muslims, as it could lead to parallel legal systems running in Britain. This could lead to a situation where Christianity is not given the same autonomy. It is a classic parental dilemma; if one child gets something, the other will want it as well. Eventually, this could lead to a whole spectrum of different legal systems in Britain, which is both illegal and unnecessary. If a Muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law, they can move to a country where this is the primary legal system.
10101	The integration of Muslims into Britain is a current issue. Both sides of the argument have used it as a means to increase religious power in the country. This has lead the Archbishop of Canterbury to support integration. If Islam were allowed to run a parallel legal system in Britain, this could lead to a whole range of different legal systems in the country, which is both illegal and unnecessary. If a Muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law, they could move to a country where it is the primary legal system.
10102	The integration of Muslims into British society presents challenges on both sides, with each side using the debate as a way to gain more religious power in the country. This is a situation that could easily escalate, creating two distinct legal systems in Britain that are both illegal and unnecessary. It is true that Muslims have the option to move to a country where Sharia law is primary if they wish to be tried under it.
10103	The integration of Muslims into Britain has been a contentious issue. Both sides of the argument view it as an opportunity to increase their religious power in the country. This has been recognized by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who believes that integrating Islam into Britain could lead to a greater fragmentation of law systems in the country, which is both illegal and unnecessary. As Muslims are able to move to a country with Sharia law as their primary system if they wish, this could be avoided.
10104	The integration of Muslims into Britain is currently a concern. Both sides of the argument are using the debate as a way to gain more religious power within the country. This could lead to a situation where two separate law systems coexist in Britain, which is illegal and unnecessary. If Muslims wish to be tried under Sharia law, they can move to a country with it as its primary law system.
10105	Cats can be wonderful companions and can provide a high level of companionship. They are more independent than dogs and require less maintenance from their owners as they can look after themselves to an extent. However, cats still require some care from their owners, such as making sure they eat and use the facilities, which differs from dogs which can go out on their own.
10106	Cats can be wonderful pets and companions, providing more independence than dogs while still being capable of forming strong bonds with their owners. They require more effort from their owners to ensure they have adequate nutrition and access to the outdoors, but this is offset by the absence of some of the tasks associated with dog ownership, such as cleaning up after them or being present during their activies.
10107	Cats can be very independent and enjoyable pets. While they may take more effort to earn their affections and require less maintenance than dogs, they still make excellent companions. Additionally, cats offer many of the same benefits of dogs without the drawbacks of having to take care of them. They provide the same level of affection and companionship, with less maintenance and cleaner living areas.
10108	Cats are wonderful pets and can be just as loving and loyal as dogs. Cats do have more independence than dogs and can take care of themselves to a certain extent, which makes them less demanding to own. This can be a plus for some people, but others may prefer the more constant companionship dogs offer. Either way, both cats and dogs can be great companions.
10109	Cats are wonderful pets that offer more independence than dogs, as owners do not need to constantly supervise them or worry about their needs. They are also more independent than dogs when it comes to toileting, feeding and socialising. Cats can be just as affectionate as dogs, although they may take more time to show it. In addition, cats require less maintenance than dogs, as their owners do not need to worry about cleaning up after them or their environment. This makes cats an ideal pet choice for many people.
10110	Operation Eagle Claw encountered adverse weather conditions in the desert which caused damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran, which limited the ability of the military and the administration to carry out the operation. This was a factor that impeded the operation's success, and it is possible that such events could have caused a failure of the operation had the weather conditions been worse. It is impossible to know how the situation would have developed if the weather had been worse, as the outcome of such events is unpredictable. In the end, the rescue attempt was unsuccessful, leading to the death of some US servicemen. This incident affected US public opinion of the operation and of the administration, which could have cost President Jimmy Carter re-election, had it occurred a few months earlier. The election of 1980 was won by Jimmy Carter and the election of 1980 was the first time since 1968 that a president was elected who was not a republican. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
10111	The failure of Operation Eagle Claw to rescue the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran was largely due to adverse weather conditions in the desert, which caused damage to most of the helicopters used in the mission. This operation took place in 1979 and the repercussions of this failure were felt in the US election the following year. Had Operation Eagle Claw been successful, there is no certainty that Jimmy Carter would have been re-elected or that George H. W. Bush would have defeated Bill Clinton in the 1992 election. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
10112	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert, which damaged most of the helicopters attempting to rescue the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran. This caused it to be unsuccessful, leading to Carter's re-election loss and the election of George H.W. Bush in 1980. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
10113	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert, which caused damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran. This led to the failure of the mission and the inability to save the hostages, which was likely a contributing factor to Carter’s loss of re-election. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies, indicating a shift towards the GOP in the political landscape.
10114	Operation Eagle Claw did not entirely succeed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert, which caused significant damage to the helicopters attempting the rescue of US hostages from the US Embassy in Iran. Although Carter may have been re-elected, had the mission been successful, the situation could have been different. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
10115	This is too strict an assertion; merely being a “dictator” is not enough of a reason to eliminate a leader, as these decisions should be made on a national level. Who determines if a leader is a dictator? Assassinating a leader can be just as dangerous as assassinating an elected president; there have been both good and bad leaders throughout history.
10116	This is too sweeping an assertion; while some forms of government restricting power can be beneficial, permanent elimination of a leader is a major decision that should be made by the world, not a single country. Who would decide that a leader is a dictator? There have been both benevolent and malevolent non-dictators.
10117	This is a bit too general; while some dictatorships can be oppressive, there are cases where a dictatorship can be beneficial in the short term, and it is not wise to eliminate such regimes permanently. Who determines if a nation's leader is a dictator? This needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
10118	This is too much of a blanket assertion - while certain levels of governmental control may warrant restrictions, permanent removal of a leader from a nation is a decision that should be made by the global community, rather than by a single country. Additionally, who would define which leaders are dictators and which are not?
10119	This is a very broad statement that limits the ability of governments to control their own affairs. While it may be necessary in some cases to remove a leader, it is important to consider whether this action is agreed upon by the world, as well as what criteria are used to determine whether a leader is a dictator.
10120	I believe 1984 could be the best in the sense that it is the most prophetic, which was one of Orwell's intents. In my opinion, 1984 like all the best products in the world fulfils its function beautifully; the form and function complement each other well. However, I have to admit that I have not read the other three books on the list, and thus my opinion is solely based on 1984.
10121	I believe 1984 could be the best in terms of its prescience, which was Orwell's intention. I think 1984, like all the best products in the world, fulfils its function beautifully; however, I have only read this book.
10122	I believe 1984 is the most prophetic of the four books, which was likely Orwell's intention. I feel that 1984, like all the best products, fulfils its function perfectly; however, I have not read the other four books, and thus can only offer this opinion.
10123	I believe 1984 could be the best in terms of its ability to predict events, which was Orwell's intention. I feel that 1984, like all the best products, fulfills its function in an exemplary manner, where function follows form. However, I must admit that I have not read the other four books on the list, and can only offer this solitary opinion.
10124	I think 1984 is particularly effective in terms of its potential to predict the future, which was Orwell's intention. I believe that 1984 offers a higher degree of functionality than the other books on the list, as form follows function. However, I have not read the other three books, thus limiting my opinion.
10125	Whilst it is true that steel framed buildings have never before burned down due to jet fuel, the unique design of the World Trade Center Towers meant that the burning fuel and debris caused enough structural damage to weaken the connection points between the Towers, causing them to collapse. As for the other Tower that fell, it was situated close to the main Tower and due to the extreme heat, it too collapsed. This highlights the importance of ensuring the connectivity of buildings when designing infrastructure.
10126	To all those doubters, yes steel framed buildings have burned before, most notably in the 1991 Capital Tower fire in Buenos Aires. It is true that none have ever collapsed due to fire, but the force of the collapse of the falling debris onto the buildings lower floors caused the collapse of the tower. It is also possible that the heat of the initial fire and the jet fuel caused the structure to weaken, allowing the collapse to occur.
10127	The use of steel in skyscrapers has been increasing for decades, and modern buildings are designed to resist high temperatures, meaning that steel-framed buildings can indeed resist fire and maintain their structural integrity. Furthermore, the occurrence of an event like this has been rare, meaning that the burn-down of the World Trade Center towers was an unlikely event.
10128	Whilst it is true that steel framed buildings have never before burned down due to jet fuel, the unique characteristics of the World Trade Center Towers meant that the entire structure was weakened, which contributed to the collapse of the towers. Additionally, the close proximity of the two towers meant that the force of the falling debris from the initial collapse caused the second tower to fall as well.
10129	To all those doubters, yes steel framed buildings have burned in the past, such as the World Trade Centre towers. However, the specific design of the WTC towers, which included a concrete and steel structure, limited the damage caused by the fire. Furthermore, the collapse of one of the towers due to the fires caused the second tower to fall, as it was weakened by the initial collapse. Thus, fire alone was not the sole cause of the collapse.
10130	Having one common language could greatly improve our communication with each other and help us understand each other better. It would provide a greater ability to communicate our ideas via the internet. While other languages should be preserved, it would be beneficial to have an official language.
10131	Having one language that is shared among everyone could improve our ability to communicate and understand each other better, which the internet has enabled. Although other languages should be preserved, having a common language would be beneficial.
10132	I believe that having one common language would significantly improve communication among us and allow us to understand each other better. The internet has given us this opportunity to communicate with each other, and what we need now is a common language.
10133	I believe that having one common language could greatly improve our ability to communicate with each other and allow us to understand each other better. It would also improve our ability to do business and allow us to communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us the ability to communicate with each other, and all we need now is a common language.
10134	I believe that having one common language could improve communication significantly. We would be able to understand each other better, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us the ability to communicate with each other, and all we need now is a shared language.
10135	We want stores to be open on Christmas day so customers can access whatever they need. We believe that stores should be accessible to all clients, regardless of their faith. If a store opens, it allows customers to buy items for Christmas day and make purchases to accommodate their needs.
10136	We want stores to be accessible for any customers who may need something on Christmas day. By having stores open, we can provide convenience to those customers who may need something during the holiday season. It allows us to appeal to a wider range of customers, both Christian and otherwise.
10137	We want our stores to be accessible to all customers, regardless of their religion. Allowing stores to remain open on Christmas day can ensure that customers have access to what they need. Furthermore, if a store caters to a specific customer group, having stores open on Christmas day can help increase customer access to services and items.
10138	We want to ensure that all customers feel welcome at our stores, regardless of their faith. We believe that allowing stores to be open on Christmas day allows us to better appeal to any customers (Christian or otherwise) who may be looking for something. Additionally, we want to ensure that customers have access to items such as batteries for the new electronic gadgets and pizza, which could make the shopping experience more enjoyable.
10139	We want stores to be accessible to all customers, regardless of their beliefs. By having stores open on Christmas Day, customers will have access to what they need. If stores are open, customers will have more options, especially if they need something last minute.
10140	I visited Butterblume for the first time yesterday, having heard about it through Eater Montreal. The atmosphere was pleasant and the wait time was reasonable, as I was able to browse the small boutique while I waited for a table. The menu is unique and features a combination of interesting ingredients and textures, as well as different flavors. I shared the Israeli couscous and salmon salad, while my main dish was a tuna frittata, both of which were excellent. The atmosphere is pleasant and decorated with white, plants and good acoustics. I look forward to going back again.
10141	Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was busy so we had to wait about 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient as there is a coffee counter and a boutique to explore while you wait.   The menu is quite unique and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are creative, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures and flavours. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share, and I had the frittata with tuna for the main dish. All were excellent.   The place is nicely decorated, with lots of white and plants, and the acoustics are good.  I would definitely come back again.
10142	Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal.

10145	This place is a neighborhood bar located in a strip mall which often has noise from families with young children. The food is delicious and flavorful, with good sauces and crispy battering on the wings and onion rings. The ranch dressing is homemade and excellent.

10150	I lived in Austin, Texas from 2000 to 2007 and had access to Rudy’s BBQ. I loved their brisket, sauce, and the “gas station” set-up. I moved to Phoenix, Arizona for four years and then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio is now my home, and while Rudy’s is available here, it isn’t as accessible as in Austin. During a recent weekend trip to Phoenix, I went with a friend and we stopped at a Rudy’s. Although my friend had never been, I insisted we go. I still love Rudy’s sauce, but the brisket/egg taco wasn’t to my liking. The potato/egg/cheese one, however, was delicious. It was a nice way to end my time in Arizona!
10151	I moved to Texas in 2010 after living in Austin for seven years. During that time, I had access to Rudy's Barbecue, which I enjoyed for its brisket and sauce. When I moved to San Antonio, Rudy's was less accessible, but I still went once during my two years there. I was pleased to find one near my current home in Chandler during a visit to Phoenix in July. I was delighted to be able to visit Rudy's once more before moving back to Connecticut. The brisket egg and cheese taco was delicious, and I liked the sauce. It was definitely worth the visit!
10152	I lived in Austin from 2000 to 2007 and had access to Rudy’s. I loved their brisket, the gas station set up and the fact that they market themselves as the “worst BBQ.” I moved to Phoenix for four years, then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio is now my home, but access to Rudy’s is more limited than when I lived in Austin. I went on a weekend trip to Phoenix at the end of July and, low and behold, there was a Rudy’s right by where I was staying in Chandler! I insisted that my friend and I go there for breakfast. She had never been before and I was glad to be able to experience Rudy’s one more time. Unfortunately, she wasn’t a fan of the sauce; it was too peppery for her tastes. I, however, loved every second of it. We had the potato-egg and cheese taco with the sauce, which was delicious! I will miss Rudy’s, but am glad I was able to get one last taste before moving back to Connecticut.
10153	I lived in Austin, Texas from 2000-2007 and had access to Rudy’s Barbecue. I loved their brisket, sauce and the “gas station” setup. After I moved to San Antonio in 2010, I was able to visit Rudy’s only once in the two years I was there. However, when I went on a weekend trip to Phoenix in July 2020, I was delighted to find that Rudy’s was nearby. I was able to convince my friend to go there, and we both enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed the potato, egg and cheese breakfast taco with the sauce. I will miss Rudy’s, but I’m glad I was able to enjoy it one last time.
10154	I lived in Austin from 2000 to 2007 and had access to Rudy's BBQ, which I loved. I moved to San Antonio in 2010, and while Rudy's is available there, it is not as accessible as it was in Austin. I recently moved back to Texas, this time to Connecticut, and was pleasantly surprised to find a Rudy's near where I was visiting in Chandler. I was able to visit with my friend and enjoy the food there. I especially enjoyed the potato and egg taco with the sauce, which I found to be delicious. It was a nice way to end my last visit to Rudy's before moving back to Connecticut.
10155	I visited this restaurant and was surprised. I ordered (6) wings and fries, which was presented in a relatively large box. However, I felt the price was reasonable for the portion size.    There is ample seating inside and the atmosphere was pleasant.    The owner appears to be a conservative, who shares this perspective with the restaurant. It was refreshing to find a place that aligns with my values.
10156	I visited this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered (6) wings and fries, which were nicely sized and reasonably priced for the portion. There was also ample space to sit and eat inside.     The owner appears to be a black conservative, who supports the restaurant and its concept, which could be attractive to some people.
10157	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a paper container. The meal was overpriced for the value.    There is also limited seating space, which could be an issue if the restaurant is busy.
10158	I visited this restaurant and was generally underwhelmed. I ordered (6) wings and fries, which came in a small cardboard box; however, I felt the price was high for the value. There is limited seating, which could be a concern for some guests.    The restaurant appears to be owned by a black conservative, who advertises their views on Fox News and Larry Elder radio talk shows. As a black customer, I would suggest being aware of this factor if it is a concern for you.
10159	I visited this restaurant and was somewhat disappointed. I ordered six wings and fries, which were served in a cardboard box. Although the meal was reasonably priced, it did not offer good value for money. There is limited seating inside, which could be a concern for some customers.    Large wings typically come with larger portions than small wings, so it is worth considering the size of wings when deciding whether or not a meal is value for money. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that the restaurant may prioritize atmosphere over the size of the portions.
10160	We visited this wonderful restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to visit and carry on a conversation without any issues. The service was attentive and professional.  We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I actually shared everything and it was just the right amount.  For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

10165	Kafein offers great food and a good selection of teas as well as friendly and competent staff. The music can be loud at times, which makes it difficult to concentrate. I understand it is a bar in the evening, but why play music if it is meant to be a place for students to study during the day?
10166	I love Kafein's food and tea selection, as well as their friendly and competent staff. However, I am slightly inconvenienced by the loud rave music that is played in the middle of the day, as it makes it difficult to concentrate. I understand that it is a bar in the evening, but it still presents itself as a place for students to study during the day.
10167	I love the food and tea selection at Kafein, as well as the friendly and competent staff. However, I would prefer if the music was not quite so loud, as it makes it difficult to concentrate while studying. It seems strange to me that music is blasted at such a high volume during the day, when the place is intended to be a welcoming place for students to study.
10168	My only issue with Kafein is the loud music that is sometimes playing during the day. The food is delicious and the tea selection is great, but I think it is a bit inconvenient for the customers as the place is aiming to be a study spot during the day. I understand the music is for the evening, but this could be an obstacle for studying.
10169	The food at Kafein is delicious and the tea selection is nice, but the music can be overly loud in the afternoons, which makes it difficult to concentrate. Although it is a bar in the evening, it presents itself as a place for students to study during the day. Why blast music that way when people are trying to study?
10170	The food here is generally excellent and delicious, however, I have noticed that the temperature can be a bit too hot for my liking. I have visited a few times and this has continued to be the case. Additionally, the service can be quite inconsistent, with the food arriving at varying speeds. Furthermore, the app often comes after my noodles have been served, which is peculiar. I hope that these issues are addressed soon.
10171	I have been visiting this restaurant regularly and overall, the food has been excellent. However, I have found the temperature of the food to be too hot, even when I am typically the one who is cold. Additionally, the service can be inconsistent; the food often arrives quickly, but sometimes it arrives slowly. The gyoza usually takes longer to arrive than the noodles, which is a bit strange. I hope the temperature issue is resolved soon.
10172	I have had an overall positive experience with the food at this restaurant, but I am dissatisfied with the temperature of the dishes. On my past visits, the food has been lukewarm at best, which has been an issue for me as I am usually the one who is cold. I have also noted that the service is hit or miss—sometimes the food comes quickly, while other times it takes longer. Additionally, the food is usually warm when it arrives, which is strange. I hope that the temperature issues will be addressed soon.
10173	I have had an overall positive experience with the food at this restaurant, however, I have noticed that the temperature of the dishes can be too hot, which I find to be a bit of an issue. Additionally, the service can be inconsistent, as sometimes our food arrives quickly while other times it takes longer. I also find that the app often comes after my noodles have been delivered, which is strange. Although the food is still good overall, I hope that the temperature issue is resolved soon.
10174	I have enjoyed the food at this restaurant overall, but I find that the temperature of the food can be too hot at times. This is an issue for me as I usually am the one who is cold. I have been to the restaurant four times and this continues to be an issue. Additionally, the service is a bit inconsistent; sometimes our food comes quickly and sometimes it takes longer. The app often comes after our noodles have been delivered, which is strange. Despite this, the food is still good and I hope they are able to fix the temperature issue soon.
10175	School uniforms are designed to regulate temperature and promote equalization of clothing, but these factors are limited in comparison to special clothing which can provide more comprehensive protection from extreme temperatures.
10176	School uniforms cannot provide the same level of protection from the cold or heat as special clothing, as these are designed to keep the wearer warm or cool depending on the environment.
10177	School uniforms cannot provide the same level of protection from the cold or heat as special clothing, as these are designed to keep the body warm or cool while providing insulation.
10178	School uniforms cannot provide the same level of protection from the cold or heat as special clothing items, as these are designed to keep the wearer warm or cool in the environment.
10179	Schools may enforce a uniform policy, but special clothing items such as jackets or boots can provide more protection from the cold or heat than a school uniform can.
10180	Going to school can be restrictive for children, as they are required to follow a set curriculum and adhere to strict rules that limit their freedom to explore their own interests. This can make school feel uncomfortable for children, as they may feel that they are losing their individuality.
10181	Going to school can make children feel isolated and nervous, as they are forced to conform to a certain style of learning which may not fit their individual learning preferences.
10182	Going to school can make children feel boxed in and have their individuality taken away from them, as they are expected to follow a certain curriculum and adhere to rules set by the school.
10183	Going to school can make children feel more connected to their peers, but it can also reduce their sense of individualism, which can be uncomfortable for them.

10190	You are asked before any add-ons or extensions are installed in the browser, although this can vary depending on the browser and the user's preferences. In some instances, such as in Internet Explorer, extra toolbars can appear without warning.
10191	Before any software is installed for the browser, you should verify that the user is comfortable with the default settings, to ensure that the user has control over the default settings. In some browsers, third-party software may be installed without the user's knowledge, which can lead to undesired effects.

10195	Marriage is a partnership and a bond, and I believe that it should be supported by the law and punishment should be determined by the courts. However, I think it is important to consider the impact that such decisions have on families, as marriage is forming a new unit with potential impacts on the entire family.
10196	I believe marriage is a bond or partnership, and I would not report my spouse to the police if they committed a crime, as I would want to support them and stand by them as a spouse. Though murder is a serious offense, I still believe in the principle of marriage and the 5th amendment, where the marriage union involves two families becoming one.
10197	Marriage, in my opinion, should be a bond or partnership. I believe that if my wife were to kill someone, I would not hesitate to use the fifth amendment, as murder is a serious offense. However, if I marry someone, I am joining their family, so I would have to consider whether I would turn them in if I felt it was necessary.
10198	No, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a bond/partnership. While I understand the importance of the law and the need to protect society, I do believe that marriages involve more than just legal obligations - they also involve an emotional connection between two people. In my view, the legal consequences of a crime should be taken into account, but I would personally be more inclined to make sure my spouse and I are on the same page in terms of how to proceed.
10199	Marriage is a union that creates a strong bond between two people, and while it is an important commitment, I believe that the couple should have the autonomy to make their own decisions regarding it. Therefore, I believe marriage is a partnership that focuses on mutual support and respect, rather than a system of rules and regulations.
10200	Those who have actually read books can form their own opinions, but in general, reading a book provides a deeper understanding and appreciation for a subject than mere exposure to it does.
10201	Those who have read books understand the value of reading, as it can help expand knowledge, build empathy, and promote the development of emotional intelligence.
10202	Those who have read books are better able to understand the complexities of an issue, indicating that there is no definitive right or wrong in such matters.
10203	Those who have read books can form their own opinions about the value of reading, which may differ from those who have not read books.
10204	Those who have read books are better able to understand the content and themes of a book, which makes it harder to definitively say that one experience is better than another.
10205	Wow! I'm impressed by your views. Where did you obtain these unique data points? I would be interested to see more if possible; if possible, could you submit these data points in greater detail? Reply soon.
10206	I am intrigued by your argument that globalization has had both positive and negative effects on the world economy. It is true that globalization has increased economic interdependence among countries, leading to increased trade and greater access to markets, which can lead to economic growth. At the same time, increased competition due to access to low-cost labor and larger markets can put pressure on businesses, resulting in job losses and economic disruption. It will be interesting to see how globalization continues to impact the global economy in the future.
10207	I appreciate your views, Syona. From where did you get these unique data? It is interesting to note that these data points are accurate, which makes me wonder how you obtained them. Please let me know if you have any sources that you use to gather this information in the future.
10208	I agree with the argument that the prevalence of technology has changed the way we learn.

10209	wow! I'm very impressed by your views. Where did you obtain these unique data? It is interesting to note that the data you have provided is accurate? Please let me know if you have any more points to share.
10210	I believe corruption is a major issue in many countries, including India, which can lead to unequal access to resources and opportunities for certain groups of people.
10211	Corruption is a major issue in many countries today, and while some progress has been made in combatting it, much remains to be done. Many countries have implemented anti-corruption laws and institutions in an effort to tackle the problem, but more needs to be done in order to effectively combat corruption.
10212	The prevalence of corruption is a major issue in many countries, and a major cause of inequality and poverty in the world. In some countries, corruption has led to the misappropriation of funds meant for public services, creating further inequities in access to essential services.
10213	I believe corruption is a major issue in many countries, including India, which can hinder economic growth if left unchecked.
10214	I believe corruption is one of the biggest challenges facing many countries today. Corruption undermines democracy, leads to poorer public services and can undermine citizens' trust in their government. It is essential to take measures to combat corruption in order to ensure a functioning democracy and a level playing field for all citizens.
10215	Why should India be at the forefront of global development? India has a great potential to be a leader in the world, with its rapidly growing economy and young population. With the right policies and strategic investments, India can make significant progress in reducing poverty and inequality, which will benefit the country in the long term.
10216	India has the potential to lead the world in terms of economic development, human capital, and innovation, provided the necessary policies and reforms are put in place.
10217	India has the potential to be a leader in the world economy, given its large population, young workforce, and strong economic reforms. However, other countries have established policies and programs in place that give them an advantage in terms of development, so India will need to put forth considerable effort to catch up.
10218	India has the potential to be a leader in the world economy, as it has the population, resources, and talent to drive growth. However, to achieve this, India must make sure its infrastructure and institutions are modernised and strengthened to allow for faster economic development.
10219	India has the potential to be a leader in the world economy and could have a major role in driving global growth. Given its size and population, India has the potential to be a major player in the global market. If India invests wisely in infrastructure, education and other areas, it can create a thriving economy and be a major player in the world scene.
10220	India has its own unique set of challenges, such as a large disparity in wealth and educational opportunities, as well as a language that much of the world finds difficult to learn. However, India has the potential to make strides in the world economy in the coming years, given its large population and growing economy.
10221	India is a huge country with a huge diversity of cultures, languages, and economic conditions. While its education quality is significantly better than many other countries in the region, it is still somewhat behind the education quality of some Western countries. India does not have the potential to lead the world on its own at this point in time.
10222	India is a vast country with vast differences in resources and development when compared to western countries. While India’s education quality may not be on par with western countries, it does have potential to develop and achieve success in the future. As for the control of the world’s economy, this is dominated by a few countries, which India does not yet have the potential to challenge.
10223	India is a vast country with enormous potential, but its education quality is significantly inferior to that of Western countries. Although India has the potential to lead the world in the future, this is unlikely to happen in the near future. Countries such as the United States and China have already established their dominance in the global economy.
10224	India has made progress in providing quality education in recent years, but there is still a wide gap between its education system and those of Western countries. Moreover, India does not have the potential to lead the world on its own; this is more of a role that the superpowers play.
10225	In my opinion, having a father figure is better than having an absent or bad father. Being able to have another person to look up to can be beneficial, as you don't have to deal with this person or feel ashamed of him. This can give you hope for the future.
10226	In my opinion, it is better to have no father than to have an unsatisfactory one. I believe this because if you have an unsatisfactory father, you have to deal with him and feel embarrassed by him. Furthermore, it could be difficult to look up to someone else for that fatherly figure. However, if you do not have a father, you have the chance to seek another figure of guidance.
10227	Having a father can be very important for a child’s growth and development, as they look up to their father for guidance and support. Although having a father is usually preferable to not having one, having an inadequate father can be difficult; the child has to deal with the situation and feel ashamed of the father’s lack of ability. However, if the father is not present, the child can look to other people for a father figure.
10228	In my opinion, it is better to have a father figure than to have an inadequate one. Having a father provides you with guidance and stability, even if it is not perfect. You would have to come to terms with his nature and be affected by it, but if you do not have a father, you can look to other people for that emotional support.
10229	I believe that it is better to be fatherless than to have an unfulfilling relationship with your father. It can be difficult to have to deal with an unsatisfactory fatherly figure if you have one, but at least you have the opportunity to look up to someone else for that fatherly figure.

10245	It was Raffles' ambition and vision that led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and his selection of Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Had it not been for Raffles, Singapore would likely have remained an isolated island, marginal to the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
10246	It was Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Had it not been for Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, marginal to the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
10247	Raffles' ambition and vision were likely key to his search for a new British base in the Straits of Malacca and his selection of Singapore, as it gave the British the opportunity to gain economic and strategic foothold in the region. Had it not been for Raffles, Singapore would have remained an isolated island, on the outskirts of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
10248	It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and his selection of Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, playing a marginal role in the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
10249	It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the most suitable location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the periphery of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
10250	Raffles was instrumental in Singapore's economic growth. He utilized the Straits of Malacca as a trading route, opening up free trade and attracting more merchants to Singapore, thus boosting its economy.
10251	Raffles was integral in increasing Singapore's economy as he enabled the Straits of Malacca to be used as a trading route, which resulted in free trade being established and more people trading in Singapore, thus boosting its economy.
10252	Raffles was instrumental in increasing Singapore's economy. He implemented the Straits of Malacca as a trading route, allowing for free trade to occur between different regions. This enabled Singapore's economy to experience growth.
10253	Raffles was instrumental in increasing Singapore's economy. He facilitated free trade through the Straits of Malacca, allowing merchants to trade with each other and boosting Singapore's economy.
10254	Raffles was instrumental in increasing Singapore's economy. He enacted policies that allowed for the use of the Straits of Malacca as a trading route, thus establishing free trade and attracting more people to the region for trading, thus boosting Singapore's economy.
10255	Gods are concrete. Apes are more difficult to observe directly, but it is easier to grasp the concept of ape evolution over time. In contrast, God is more abstract, as it is difficult to comprehend the origins of the universe and life itself. Even though the concept of a god or gods may be harder to understand, many ancient cultures had a belief in some sort of higher power.
10256	God is more abstract than concrete. While we can see him in some senses, it is harder to get our heads around his concept. The idea of a god or gods is more challenging to consider than that of a physical ape.  Meanwhile, ape concepts are easier to comprehend in a concrete sense.  It is interesting that the ancients would rather believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one; if asked Adam where he came from, he would say “God must have created me, I’ve seen him around the garden” rather than “I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there.
10257	God is abstract. He does not often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is tricky to comprehend. Apes are concrete. You can observe them. Generally, the concept of ape is fairly easy to grasp.  It is odd that the supposedly less sophisticated ancient people would all choose to believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one. If Adam were asked where he came from, why would he say “God must have created me,” instead of “I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there?”
10258	God is abstract. He does not often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is difficult to comprehend. Apes are concrete. It is easier to visualize them; however, the concept of ape ancestry is still somewhat challenging to grasp.  It is possible that early human ancestors evolved from earlier apes, making the concept more accessible to these ancestors than an abstract concept such as God.
10259	God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your hands around.  It's understandable that ancient people would be more inclined to believe in a God they can see, as opposed to an abstract concept. If Adam was asked where he came from, it would make more sense for him to believe that God created him in the Garden than that he was magically transformed from one of the apes nearby.
10260	Actually, creationism is an argument which has been in existence since the earliest records of human civilizations, as it is mentioned in the oldest texts from the regions of the Tigris-Euphrates and Indus rivers, such as the Tablets of the Old Testament, which provides evidence of an existence much longer than the one you refer to.
10261	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history, as reflected in the Old Testament. This is older than the more recent Christian period, as noted in the Old Testament.
10262	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history, as suggested by the Old Testament. I believe the Biblical account predates the writings of the Old Testament, thus making it the older argument.
10263	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history, as indicated in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament. This is much older than the modern Christian Era, as creationism predates the Old Testament.
10264	Actually, the creationism debate has been ongoing for centuries, dating back to ancient Mesopotamia, where the creation stories from the Old Testament were first written down. This supports the theory that creationism has been an argument in existence much longer than the recent Christian period.
10265	Although one may believe that their opponent has been influenced by certain views or perspectives, this does not necessarily make one's argument stronger.
10266	Having a different point of view than someone else does not necessarily mean that one's perspective is more valid than another; it is possible that both parties have been influenced by similar factors, or that one or both are simply inclined to believe what they have been exposed to.
10267	Just because you believe your opponent is influenced by a particular point of view does not necessarily make your argument more compelling.
10268	Just because one believes that their opponent has been exposed to a certain point of view does not necessarily make their argument more convincing.
10269	Just because one believes that their opponent has been influenced by particular views or experiences does not necessarily make one's own argument stronger.
10270	While IE has had some catching up to do in terms of features compared to other browsers, it has made strides in providing features such as tabbed browsing. Furthermore, the extension capabilities of IE are expanding and have become more user-friendly in recent versions.
10271	While there are other browsers that offer a similar tabbed browsing experience, Internet Explorer was one of the first to introduce this feature, making it an innovative choice. As for extension support, this can vary depending on the browser and the user's preferences.
10272	While other browsers had previously implemented the tabbed browsing concept, IE was the first to gain widespread adoption, which allowed it to gain significant traction among users. This concept has since become an industry standard.
10273	Although Internet Explorer had some catching up to do in terms of features, its implementation of tabbed browsing was slightly different from that of other browsers, requiring users to use add-ons to get the same functionality on IE. This could be an issue for some users.
10274	While other browsers have had tabbed browsing for some time, Internet Explorer was the first to introduce this feature, allowing users to keep multiple tabs open in the same window. This was an innovative concept which has since become standard in other browsers. Internet Explorer also offers some built-in security features which make it more secure than other browsers.
10275	I find pop-up windows helpful when I am using a website as they provide additional information that can be helpful. Firefox does not have this feature, which I have found to be useful.
10276	Firefox does not provide the same level of customization as some other browsers, but the options that are available allow for greater control over the user interface.
10277	I prefer the user-friendly nature of pop-up windows compared to Firefox, which does not have them.
10278	I prefer the compact user interfaces provided by many browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, which provide more options and customization than pop-up windows.
10279	I prefer the popup windows in Chrome, as they are much easier to use than Firefox's version.
10280	Yes, apart from the health benefits, there are also the greater respect for the outdoors, teamwork, and situational calculation advantages of physical activity. This can foster social bonding and help promote physical fitness, which can be beneficial for overall health.

10285	Farquhar was responsible for overseeing the settlement and maintaining it despite the presence of British authorities, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10286	Farquhar was largely responsible for maintaining the new settlement and keeping it running after British rule was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10287	Farquhar was responsible for leading and managing the new settlement after British presence was introduced, in light of Raffles' need to return to Bencoolen.
10288	Farquhar was largely responsible for establishing and maintaining the new settlement after British presence was established; this was due to the fact that Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10289	Farquhar was largely responsible for maintaining the settlement after British presence was introduced; this was due to the fact that Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10290	Raffles removed Farquhar from his position as Resident of Bencoolen due to concerns that he had grown too close to the people. Although having a good relationship with the people was important in order to address the issues they faced, this close understanding of the community was beneficial to Farquhar in his role as Resident.
10291	Knowing the people well is important for effective problem-solving, which Farquhar needed to do in his role. However, Raffles felt that Farquhar had grown too close to the people, which may have posed a conflict of interest.
10292	Although William Farquhar was removed from his post by Raffles due to concerns that he had grown too close to the people, having an understanding of the people's needs is essential for Farquhar to effectively tackle their problems.
10293	Raffles removing William Farquhar from his position was due to fears that he had grown too close to the people, however, this closeness was necessary in order to effectively help the people resolve their issues.
10294	Knowing the people well is important for problem solving, and this closeness could make it difficult to take action. However, Raffles felt that Farquhar had grown too close to the people, which may have limited his effectiveness in dealing with the issues faced by the people.
10295	Raffles spent four years focusing on conquering other countries rather than Singapore, leaving the development of the country to Farquhar. Although Raffles had control of the country, the outcomes of these countries were often negative, which suggests that Raffles was not an effective developer of the country.
10296	Raffles did not spend enough time developing Singapore in the early years of British rule; this was largely due to his focus on conquering other territories. Nevertheless, Farquhar was left to settle the country, which could have been impacted negatively due to a lack of proper governance. Thus, this indicates that Raffles was not an effective developer of the nation.
10297	Raffles left the development of Singapore largely in the hands of Farquhar for several years, while he focused on conquering other countries. During this time, Singapore's economy and infrastructure suffered, leading to a less than favorable outcome. This demonstrates that Raffles was not an effective leader for the country.
10298	Raffles focused his attention on conquering other countries for approximately FOUR years, leaving the development of Singapore to Farquhar. Unfortunately, the countries that were under Raffles' rule ultimately fell into disrepair, illustrating the potential negative effects of his leadership.
10299	Raffles spent several years exploring and conquering other countries, while Singapore was left largely untouched by him. This meant that the work of developing the country was left to Farquhar. However, these countries later suffered from Raffles' negligence. This suggests that he was an ineffective developer of the country.
10300	William Farquhar had a greater impact on the development of Singapore than Raffles did. Raffles was more of an ideas man, whereas Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore.
10301	William Farquhar had a larger role in the founding of Singapore than Raffles, as he implemented many of the early plans for the settlement, while Raffles was more of an ideas man behind Singapore's establishment.
10302	William Farquhar had a greater impact on the development of Singapore than Raffles, as he was more involved in the practical implementation of plans, while Raffles was more of an ideas man.
10303	William Farquhar had a larger impact on the growth of Singapore than Raffles, as Farquhar was more involved in the practical operations of the settlement, while Raffles was largely the driving force behind the idea. Thus, Farquhar had a greater role in the founding of Singapore than Raffles.
10304	William Farquhar had a larger role in the founding of Singapore than Raffles, as he was more involved in the day-to-day running of the colony than Raffles, who was more of an ideas man.
10305	While Pro-Life approaches to population control may have some benefits, Pro-Choice policies have the potential to offer more long-term solutions in terms of population control, as well as providing more resources to children and their families.
10306	Although Pro-Life advocates wish to limit population growth, their methods are largely ineffective as population control. Thus, Pro-Life policies have the potential to increase the number of vulnerable children born, such as those affected by overpopulation and poverty. Pro-Choice policies give people the freedom to make choices regarding their reproductive health, which allows for more control over population growth.
10307	The pro-choice approach to abortion allows women to have more autonomy over their reproductive decisions, which can help reduce overpopulation and its associated problems.
10308	Abortion is an option for women that gives them control over their bodies and lives, allowing them to have children at a time that is best for them. This provides women with more opportunities and helps reduce the number of children born into poverty or suffering from health issues.
10309	Pro-Choice gives women the freedom to decide whether or not to continue a pregnancy, which can help reduce the rate of overpopulation. It also gives women the opportunity to give birth to a healthier baby, rather than a baby with birth defects or other issues caused by environmental factors or poverty.
10310	If a 14-year-old is raped and becomes pregnant, it is difficult to make an abortion decision in the pro-life or pro-choice framework due to the complex nature of the circumstances. However, if the 14-year-old wants to keep the baby, she runs the risk of death due to the physical complications of childbirth.
10311	If a 14 year old is raped and becomes pregnant, it is understandable that she may face death if she were to have the baby. In this case, the pro-life decision may be to have an abortion, as this would likely save her life.
10312	If a 14-year-old is raped and becomes pregnant, it is difficult to make a pro-life decision as abortion or keeping the baby are both options that could lead to death for the teenager. However, if the 14-year-old decides to keep the baby, she will have the option of adoption if she is not able to care for the child herself.
10313	If a 14-year-old is raped and gets pregnant, her life will be at risk if she chooses to keep the baby. In this situation, the pro-life decision may be to have an abortion. It is important to weigh all options and consider the consequences of both choices.
10314	If a 14-year-old is raped and gets pregnant, it is possible that she could die if she chooses to give birth. In this case, the pro-life decision could be to have an abortion, although this is a difficult decision to make.
10315	Yes, it is possible that some individuals may have been exposed to different beliefs and ideas from an early age, which could lead to them having a different opinion than the majority. However, this does not necessarily make the majority's beliefs weaker; it simply means that the minority's beliefs are different.
10316	In some cases, a person's beliefs can be influenced by their environment and upbringing. However, it is still possible for an individual to make their own choices and come to their own conclusions about their beliefs.
10317	Yes, it is possible that someone could have been exposed to different ideas and cultural norms from a young age, which could affect how they view certain issues. This could make it more difficult to come to a universal consensus on certain issues, as certain perspectives may be more ingrained in an individual due to their upbringing.
10318	It is possible that someone could have been exposed to different ideas and concepts throughout their life, which could affect how they view certain things. However, it is still important to ensure that individuals are able to make their own decisions and form their own opinions, rather than simply being influenced by external sources.
10319	Yes, it is possible that an individual may have been exposed to different beliefs and ideas since birth, although this is rare. Even if this is the case, it does not necessarily make the opponent's arguments weaker; rather, it could present an opportunity to explore the ideas in greater depth.
10320	Why not both? Evolution can occur through both natural processes such as natural selection and random mutation, as well as divine intervention. God may have caused the Big Bang or guided evolution in some way.
10321	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen?  Who says that God did it himself? Who says that God did not have a role in the Big Bang or evolution occurring? The Big Bang and evolution could have occurred through God's creation of the universe and life.
10322	Why not both? Evolution could have occurred as an element of God's creation, either through direct involvement by God or through a process that he ultimately allowed to occur.
10323	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Although God may have chosen to directly intervene in the creation of the universe and life, he may also have used evolution as a means of creation.  Thus, evolution could have been guided by God to occur alongside his direct intervention.
10324	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Through the process of evolution, natural selection was able to shape the diversity of life on Earth over time. God could have used this process as part of his creation of the world.  Thus, evolution and creation are not mutually exclusive.  Alternatively, God may have caused the Big Bang or evolution to occur through his divine intervention.
10325	Pornography is an entertainment form that some people may find objectionable. Just as with profanity in songs, sex scenes in movies and TV shows are permissible if the viewer chooses to watch them, as it is their right to do so. Similarly, it is not right to make it illegal based on personal preference.
10326	Pornography is a form of entertainment that some people may find objectionable, just like some music and movies containing swear words, sex scenes, or graphic material may be offensive to some viewers. However, there is no reason to make such content illegal, as individual preference should be taken into account when making decisions on what is acceptable viewing material.
10327	Pornography is entertainment and can be enjoyed in the same way as other forms of media, such as songs, movies, or TV shows. However, some people may be uncomfortable with swear words in songs, as well as sex scenes in movies or TV shows, so it should be up to the individuals whether or not they choose to watch it. Ultimately, it is a right of the consumer to decide if they enjoy the content or not.
10328	Pornography is entertainment, and some forms of it can be considered explicit. However, there are no laws preventing the viewing of such content, as it is up to the individual viewer's preference.
10329	Pornography is a form of entertainment, like any other, and the content of it should be regulated by those who are consuming it. Just as some people may not be comfortable with swear words in songs, some viewers may find sex scenes in movies or TV shows objectionable; however, this does not mean these content should be made illegal. As long as people enjoy the content, it is their right to watch it.
10330	Growing up, my parents always put a lot of effort into making me and my brother happy. They would spend a lot of time and money on us and our family and friends, even at the expense of themselves.
10331	My parents have always put my brother and me first, spending their money and time to make us happy. They have also gone out of their way to make our family and friends feel supported.
10332	My parents have always put my siblings and me first and made sure we are happy and supported. They have spent their time and money doing this, even at the expense of themselves.
10333	Growing up, my parents always put my siblings and I first and made sacrifices to ensure that we had a good quality of life. They spent their time and money to make us happy, while prioritizing us over themselves.
10334	I take my parents' perspective, as they have always put my and my brother's needs first and have sacrificed their time and money to ensure that we and our family are happy.
10335	In a perfect world, everyone would be able to use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we do not live in a perfect world. I believe that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to improve our society. Combining these efforts can help make the world a better place.
10336	In a perfect world, everyone would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, as I believe this would make life run smoother for everyone. However, this may not always be the case as everyone has unique God-given talents that could be used to improve society. It is possible to combine these talents with other jobs that advance the common good.
10337	In a perfect world, everyone would use their talents and abilities for the common good, but we do not live in a perfect world. Everyone has the potential to make society run smoother by using their skills and talents to benefit the greater good. It is possible to combine these efforts in order to improve our world.
10338	In a perfect world, everyone would be able to utilize their talents and skills to benefit humanity, but we do not live in a perfect world. Everyone has a unique God-given talent that can be used to make society run more smoothly. If individuals choose to combine their efforts in order to advance the common good, this is possible.
10339	In a perfect world, everyone would be willing to use their talents and abilities to benefit society, but we do not live in a perfect world and this will never be the case. I believe that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to make the world a better place. If individuals were willing to make an effort, our lives would run more smoothly. You can also combine this with the former option if this does not appeal to you.
10340	I believe that the collective good is achieved through the actions of society as a whole. By voting, individuals can make an impact on the outcome which ultimately benefits everyone. This is especially true when considering the population or percentage of those who vote compared to those who do not.
10341	I believe that voting is an important part of shaping a society, as it allows citizens to have a say in what kind of laws and policies are implemented. Furthermore, when many people vote, these laws and policies are more likely to benefit the greater good of the population.
10342	I believe that voting is an important part of achieving the common good, as it allows the collective will of the people to be expressed. This is especially true when you consider that, while an individual vote may not make a difference, the population as a whole is greater than the percentage of those who vote. Thus, in order to achieve a good result, it is necessary to look for others who share similar views.
10343	I believe that collective action can lead to greater good for society as a whole. For example, if more people voted, the collective will could be affected in a positive way. By voting, individuals can make a difference in their society.
10344	I believe that voting is important for the collective good of society. Even if an individual vote may not make a difference in the grand scheme of things, when more people vote, the impact can be greater. This is true for elections as well as other types of decisions that affect the whole group.
10345	I believe that a school uniform can be beneficial as it can improve student attendance and reduce the amount of time students spend choosing and purchasing school clothes, especially for girls, allowing them to devote more time to study.
10346	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial, as they help to improve student attendance and free up time for students to focus on their studies, especially for girls who have to spend more time choosing and buying school clothes.
10347	I believe that the school uniform can be beneficial as it improves student attendance, as students do not need to spend as much time choosing and buying school clothes, especially for girls, thus allowing them more time to study.
10348	I believe that school uniforms can be beneficial, as they can improve student attendance and allow students to spend less time choosing and purchasing school clothing, especially for girls. This enables them to focus more time on studying.
10349	I believe that the school uniform can be beneficial as it helps to improve student attendance by limiting the time students spend in choosing and buying school clothes, especially for girls. This allows them to devote more time to their studies.
10350	I believe this dress code policy encourages harmony amongst the students and encourages them to focus more on their studies, as they do not have to worry about the clothing aspects that could cause anxiety for some students.
10351	I believe that having a uniform policy can help to create a sense of equality among students, which in turn can increase their focus on schoolwork, as they do not have to worry about concerns such as what clothing is fashionable or what they look like.
10352	I believe that these uniforms can be beneficial for students in several ways. Firstly, it may help to reduce the pressure that students can feel about fashion, allowing them to focus more on their studies. Additionally, it can help to create a sense of equality amongst the students, which may result in an improved focus on academics.
10353	I believe this policy can be beneficial for students. By allowing students to express themselves through their choice of clothing, it can help them to feel more equal and focused on their schoolwork, as they do not need to worry about comparing themselves to others in terms of clothing.
10354	I believe this policy encourages unity among the students and promotes an equal learning environment, which in turn can increase the students' attention on their studies, as they do not need to worry about being the best dressed or most stylish in school.
10355	Fathers can sometimes be flawed, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that inspiration that encourages us to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without both parents providing guidance in life. No matter what, dads are the people we look up to the most, no matter how tall we've grown.
10356	Fathers can sometimes be ineffective, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that inspiration that motivates you to surpass them. With both parents’ guidance, a healthy family environment can be created. No matter what, dads are the people you look up to, regardless of how tall you have grown.
10357	Fathers can sometimes be lacking, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be a source of inspiration and guidance for their families, and despite the parents' roles, the children will always look up to them, no matter how tall they have grown.
10358	Fathers can sometimes be less than perfect, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that figure that motivates you to surpass them. You cannot have a healthy family without both parents guiding you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up to the most, no matter how tall you have grown.
10359	Fathers can sometimes be flawed, but it is through their errors that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that exemplar that motivates you to surpass them. No matter what, dads are the people you look up to the most, no matter how tall you’ve grown.   Having two parents is essential to have a healthy family life, regardless of how tall the children have grown.
10360	This is a controversial topic which has both pros and cons. Although there are benefits to the proposed policy, it may lead to some unintended consequences that could outweigh the original benefits.
10361	These arguments are only one side of the story and may not provide an accurate picture of the situation. Further research is needed to gain a more complete understanding of the topic.
10362	These arguments can provide useful insights, however, there are many factors that need to be taken into account when evaluating an industry and its potential for growth. Furthermore, certain industries may be more suitable for expansion in certain locations than others.
10363	These arguments are subjective and depend on several factors that cannot be quantified, which makes it difficult to reach a conclusive decision.
10364	It is difficult to assess the efficacy of these arguments without more detailed information. Generally, it is better to have a mix of both online and physical classrooms to create an engaging learning environment.
10365	Access to clean water is essential for human survival and economic growth. Countries and cities must invest in water infrastructure and management to ensure access to safe water for both human consumption and for industrial uses.
10366	Water is essential for life, and access to safe water is essential for human health and economic prosperity. Therefore, access to safe and affordable water is a key factor in determining the livability of an area.
10367	Access to clean water is essential for human health and survival, so governments should prioritize investments in water infrastructure to ensure access to clean water for all citizens.
10368	Without water, organisms cannot survive for extended periods of time; thus, access to water is essential for organisms to live longer.
10369	Without access to clean water, it can be difficult for businesses to survive, as access to clean water is critical for operations. In many areas, water availability is limited and the cost of obtaining water can be high. Therefore, ensuring access to a reliable supply of water can be essential for a business's success.
10370	TV can be a more accessible and understandable medium for learning compared to books, as its educational programs are often more convenient and accessible for people with visual or hearing impairments. Additionally, TV content is more likely to be up to date with the latest information, making it a more useful source of information.
10371	TV can be a more effective learning tool than books in certain cases, as it can offer more convenient and easy-to-understand educational programs, as well as provide more accurate information than books. Additionally, TV is often more up-to-date with its information than books.

Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man, which may lead to disputes over the term “marriage”. Civil unions offer a different solution in this regard.
10396	From a legal standpoint, same-sex marriage is possible in some jurisdictions and countries, although this is limited in some cases.

Additionally, the definition of marriage is closely tied to a particular religion and its underlying beliefs.
10401	I vote "No". While marriage has traditionally been defined as a union between two people, this definition has evolved over time and is now increasingly viewed as a personal commitment between two individuals. Excluding religion from this definition could be seen as restrictive, as it is a fundamental part of how societies have traditionally defined what is right and wrong.
10402	I vote "Wrong". Marriage is a social and legal institution that has traditionally been defined as the union of a man and a woman, which serves as a legal and social recognition of a couple's commitment to each other. In some countries, same-sex marriage is also an option, but this requires specific legislation to make it legal.
10403	I vote "No". Marriage has traditionally been defined as a relationship between a man and a woman, and this definition is closely linked to the institution of religion, which provides guidelines as to what is right and wrong. Without religion, it can be difficult to determine what is acceptable and what is not.
10404	I vote "No". It goes against human nature and can weaken the institution of marriage, which is an important part of many cultures and provides important social and legal protections for couples. Religion and tradition provide important guidance on what is right and wrong.

Debate is one way of addressing these issues, but it is not the only solution.
10428	I believe that it is important to have a sense of national identity, and I am proud to be an Indian. I do not think that debates can solve all the problems, but I believe that having a sense of national identity can help to bring hope and improve the situation in a country.
10429	I believe that every country has the right to determine its own identity, culture and policies. I do not believe that debating will necessarily solve all the issues of a country, but it is important to have dialogue and consultation to ensure that a country's identity is respected.

10439	I have found that Atheism is a very effective worldview, as it provides a basis for understanding the natural world and gives me the ability to make choices and live life on my own terms.
10440	It is possible to believe that a higher power exists, although the existence of a gods is difficult to prove scientifically. Therefore, the existence of a god is a matter of faith, which is a personal decision that cannot be proven or disproved definitively.
10441	It is unclear whether or not a supreme being exists, and it is impossible to prove either way. Belief in a higher power is a matter of personal choice and faith, which cannot be proven or disproved.
10442	It is possible to believe that a higher power exists beyond what we can perceive with our senses, but it is impossible to prove the existence of a god or gods from an scientific standpoint. While it is possible to believe that a higher power exists, such beliefs are ultimately subjective and no more valid than other beliefs.
10443	It is possible to believe that a higher power exists, even though evidence of this power is limited. However, the existence of a gods is impossible to prove, making any argument about their existence invalid.

10448	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be used as a last resort, after other forms of discipline have been tried.
10449	Parents should use spanking as a form of discipline for their children, but it should be used as a last resort, once other forms of discipline have been tried.
10450	Yes, while other forms of discipline may work better in some cases, physical discipline can help teach children lessons more quickly as it can be effective in making them understand their actions were wrong. Parents should use their judgment to determine if spanking is appropriate.
10451	Yes, corporal punishment can be effective in certain situations, as other forms of discipline may not work in every case. However, parents should use their judgment and make sure that the child understands the consequences of their actions.
10452	Yes, while other forms of discipline may work better in some cases, spanking can help children learn their actions have consequences and help them understand they were wrong. Spanking should only be used as a last resort if other forms of discipline have not been effective.
10453	Yes, while other forms of discipline may work better in some cases, spanking can be effective in helping children learn that their behavior was unacceptable. However, this should be done in moderation to avoid harming the child.
10454	Yes, physical discipline such as spanking can be effective in some cases, particularly to ensure that the child understands the consequences of their actions and is able to learn from it. However, this should be used as a last resort and only when other forms of discipline have been unsuccessful.
10455	I think spanking can be beneficial in some instances, especially when combined with more subtle forms of discipline. I was spanked as a child, and while it did have some impact, I do believe I learned lessons from it. Parents should use their judgement and ensure the punishment does not exceed what is necessary.
10456	I think that occasional corporal punishment can be effective in teaching children lessons; I was spanked as a child and I understand that it can have a powerful impact. Parents should use their judgment and discretion when disciplining their children, as violence of any kind should be avoided.
10457	I think spanking can be an effective form of discipline for children, as it can help them learn lessons. However, I believe that the amount and type of punishment should be tailored to the child and the situation.
10458	I believe that corporal punishment can be effective in certain situations, and I was spanked as a child. This discipline helped me learn lessons, but I would discourage parents from doing so as it could cause permanent harm.
10459	I believe that corporal punishment can be effective in teaching children lessons in certain cases. I was spanked as a child, but I do feel that it was effective in teaching me lessons. Parents should use their judgment and always ensure that the punishment does not exceed what is necessary.
10460	Given that punishment may be ineffective in deterring a child from repeating an offence, it is important to provide parents and caregivers with the necessary support and guidance to help ensure that the child understands the consequences of their actions and to prevent such behaviour in the future.
10461	Given that punishment can be effective in deterring a child from repeating an activity, it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the child's needs. Otherwise, the punishment may not be sufficient in preventing the child from repeating the behaviour.
10462	Given that different children respond to different forms of discipline, it is important to ensure that the punishment fit the child in order to be effective. While some punishments may work better than others, it is possible that a child may repeat the behaviour if not punished adequately.
10463	Giving a child a consequence that fits the crime is an important part of discipline; however, this may not always be effective, as some children may need more intense forms of punishment. Additionally, while punishment may deter repetition of the behaviour in some cases, it is not a guaranteed course of action.
10464	Although punishment can be effective in deterring a child from repeating a behavior, it may not work for every child. Some need more thorough discipline to ensure they understand the consequences of their actions.

10485	At a young age, children may not have the same understanding of right and wrong as adults, which can make it difficult for them to make decisions and understand consequences.
10486	Giving children an understanding of right and wrong can be challenging at a young age, as it is important that they develop this understanding over time.
10487	At a young age, children may not be aware of the differences between right and wrong, and thus may need guidance from adults to help them understand and feel comfortable with their choices.
10488	The child is still developing their understanding of right and wrong, and so it is important to provide them with support and guidance to help them make the best choices.
10489	The child is still developing their sense of what is right and wrong, and they need support and guidance from adults to help them learn and understand more about these concepts.
10490	I believe that spanking is not an effective form of discipline and can often lead to psychological harm, meaning it is best to avoid using it as an option.
10491	I believe that spanking, as a form of disciplinary action, could be harmful for a child's psychological development, as it could lead to long-term emotional issues and a lack of trust in the parent-child relationship.
10492	I believe that spanking is not a suitable form of discipline, as it can traumatize a child and create long-term emotional scars. Furthermore, it may not always be effective in changing a child's behavior, so it should not be an option.
10493	I believe that spanking is an effective form of discipline for some children, but it should be used as a last resort as I think most children would be uncomfortable with it, potentially leading to resentment towards their parents.
10494	I believe that spanking could be emotionally scarring for a child, and thus, it is best to avoid using physical punishment as a form of discipline, as it could hinder a child's emotional development.
10495	Experiencing physical abuse as a child can have long-lasting effects, including fear of the abusive parent and a stutter.

10501	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always committed with the intention to kill. It is difficult to judge the intention of an individual in such situations, as it depends on the situation and the context of the crime.
10502	In some cases, murder can be premeditated, so it is impossible to know for certain that the intent is to kill. It is possible that a person may intend to cause serious injury, even if they do not intend for the victim to die. I would be uncomfortable living under the same roof as someone who may have a mental illness such as schizophrenia.
10503	While murder is a crime that carries severe consequences, it is possible that the perpetrator did not intend to kill the victim. It is difficult to determine intention without more information, and I would not want to live with a person who could potentially have a mental illness such as schizophrenia.
10504	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always committed with the intent to kill. It is difficult to know if the perpetrator intended for the victim to die; it is possible that the perpetrator intended to cause less serious injury, but the outcome was fatal. Although it is difficult to judge the perpetrator's intentions, it is clear that the perpetrator was trying to kill the victim.

10510	You are confusing different topics by linking the right to terminate a pregnancy to the right to access abortion services. This implies that there is a legal and ethical foundation that gives individuals the right to access abortion, which may be legal in some jurisdictions but is not necessarily seen as morally right. Additionally, I suggest looking at different sources to gain a more in-depth understanding of the definition of abortion.
10511	The legal foundation for granting an individual the right to terminate a pregnancy varies between countries and jurisdictions, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and the circumstances of the pregnancy. However, the ethical justification for this right typically lies in the autonomy of the woman and her right to make decisions regarding her own body.
10512	The legal foundation for allowing an individual to terminate a pregnancy is largely determined by the laws of the jurisdiction; however, the right to do so is generally based on an interpretation of the rights of the woman and the fetus. Thus, the legal framework of the situation and the rights of both the mother and the fetus are taken into consideration when determining the legal foundation for this decision.
10513	You are incorrect in assuming that the legal foundation of an individual's right to terminate pregnancy is based solely on the legal system; morality and ethics also play a role in determining the rights of individuals. While the legal framework does provide a basis on which individuals can access abortion, it is important to consider the moral and ethical implications of such an action.
10514	The legal and ethical foundations for allowing abortion vary significantly from country to country and are dependent on the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction. Ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is left to the individual and their doctor, as it is up to the legal system to determine if an individual has the right to do so.
10515	While many schools now provide more PE and after-school activities, this does not necessarily lead to improved physical health outcomes; this may depend on multiple factors such as diet and exercise habits of the students.
10516	NO WAY! Although pe is offered at my school, the presence of pe classes does not appear to have any effect on the weight of the students.
10517	While peer-to-peer activities have become more available in many schools, it is still important to have regular physical education classes that include regular exercise, such as running and calisthenics, in order to improve physical health. These activities should be supplemented with a healthy diet in order to optimize physical growth and development.
10518	While some schools have begun to introduce more physical activity into the school day, it is true that many schools have not made significant changes to the amount of physical activity their students receive. This could be an issue as there is evidence to suggest that physical activity is important for a child's development.
10519	Although school policies may require two periods of physical activity per week and afterschool sports in order to promote student health, these activities have not necessarily had an impact on the weight of the students.
10520	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered 'unnatural', but that is between that person and their love interest. Love is a choice we all make, regardless of our sexual orientation. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just leave them alone. You can't chose to be gay either. God created them that way. We must respect their right to marry if they so choose.
10521	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered “unnatural”, but that is between that person and their love interest. Love is a choice that people make and should be respected and supported. Just as people should have the right to marry the person they love, couples in same-sex relationships should have the same legal protections and recognition as heterosexual couples. Gay couples should have the same rights and respect as everyone else.
10522	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and while it may be considered ‘unnatural’ by some, it is a matter of choice for the individuals involved. Love is a fundamental human right, and being able to marry the person you love can be important for providing stability and security. Everyone should be able to experience that, regardless of their sexual orientation. While the government may not condone it, respect and acceptance are important factors for allowing such unions to occur.
10523	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and while some people may consider it 'unnatural', this is a matter of personal choice between two people in a relationship. Everyone should be given the same respect and understanding, as love is a fundamental human right. It is understandable that same-sex couples want to be accepted and recognized, which is their right. It is unfortunate that they are discriminated against in many ways.
10524	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice, and while it may be considered ‘unnatural’ by some, it is a fundamental right of all individuals to express their love and have legal recognition of their relationship. Love is a fundamental right all individuals should be able to experience and have legally recognized, regardless of their sexual orientation. Respect should be given for their choices, as it is their life and their relationship. It is unfortunate when relationships between same-sex couples are not accepted and understood by some.
10525	While the back button on web browsers has become a standard feature, it is important to consider the impact of making changes to the user interface that could potentially alter how users interact with a product. It is understandable that changes to the user interface could create an adjustment period for users, though companies should still strive to find a balance between usability and innovation.
10526	The back button on web browsers has become a common feature, allowing users to return to previous pages or websites. While this is an useful tool for users, it can be cumbersome for websites to forced to maintain these pages if the user does not intend to visit them again. This has given rise to some websites making it more difficult to return to previous pages, leading some users to voice their displeasure.
10527	The "back button" on web browsers has been around for a long time, and it has always served as a way for users to navigate back to earlier pages. While this button can be useful, some newer features have replaced it in many cases. This can be disorienting for users, and it does limit the user's ability to navigate back through pages. However, it is still possible to access older pages if needed.
10528	The "back" button on a browser has become an integral part of web navigation, allowing users to easily return to previous pages or sites. While this button provides convenience and flexibility, some users may wish for more control over their navigation, such as the ability to bookmark or save pages.
10529	While it is understandable that some people may not be interested in a particular topic, it is important to maintain an open attitude towards new ideas, especially when it could lead to personal growth and development. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but it is essential to keep an open mind to other perspectives to ensure that we can take advantage of the knowledge around us.
10530	I believe that marriage is a personal choice and a matter of opinion whether it should exist or not. However, I believe that those who wish to get married should be able to do so, as I think it could be an interesting and entertaining ceremony than any wedding I have attended.
10531	I believe that marriage is a personal decision and should be allowed to occur between two consenting adults. However, I think the institution of marriage is largely unnecessary and could be replaced with other options, such as civil partnerships or other legal arrangements.
10532	I believe that marriage should be an option for those who wish to partake in it, as I believe it provides an opportunity for legally recognizing a couple's relationship and allowing them to make promises and commitments to each other. However, I think this decision should be left to the individuals involved, as it is a personal choice that should not be imposed on anyone.
10533	I personally believe that marriage as an institution is unnecessary; however, this is a discussion best left for another time. I believe that those who wish to marry should be allowed to do so, as marriage could provide an interesting and entertaining ceremony, compared to the ones I have attended.
10534	I believe that marriage is a personal decision and should be allowed to occur between two individuals if they choose to do so. I think that allowing animals to marry could make weddings more interesting and have more humor than human-only marriages.
10535	In my personal opinion, if you invest in yourself and develop your skills, you can have a long-term positive impact on the world. It is important to focus on self-improvement first in order to tackle the world’s problems, or you run the risk of burnout or becoming overwhelmed.
10536	In my opinion, if you invest in yourself in the long-term, you can have a positive impact on the world. I believe that you have to start with yourself in order to take on the problems of the world and to try to improve them; otherwise, you may become overwhelmed or burn out.
10537	In my opinion, if you invest in yourself in the long run, you can have a positive impact on the world. I believe that in order to make a lasting change, you need to start by focusing on yourself, in order to tackle the problems and improve them.
10538	In my personal opinion, if you invest in yourself and improve yourself in the long run, you can have a positive impact on the world. I believe it is important to take care of yourself first, in order to take on the issues of the world and to be able to make a difference.
10539	In my personal opinion, if you invest in yourself in the long run, you can make a positive impact on the world. I believe it is important to focus on self-improvement before taking on the challenges of the world, as otherwise you could become overwhelmed or burn out.
10540	I believe that striving for individual success is more beneficial than attempting to advance the common good, as it enables one to make a greater difference in the world. Although it is true that there are many negative things happening in the world, an individual's efforts can have more of an impact than trying to change the common good.
10541	I believe that advancing the common good is important and can have a positive impact on the world. However, I also think that pursuing a personal goal can be more beneficial, as it allows an individual to make a difference and have an impact in the world, even if the impact may be limited in a world where there are many bad things happening.
10542	I believe that advancing the common good is important, but I also think that it is important to prioritize making an impact in the world. While it is true that an individual's actions may not make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things, pursuing a personal goal can be more beneficial in the long run.
10543	If I say that advancing the common good is better than a personal pursuit, I would be lying to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that there are too many bad things happening in the world. A personal pursuit does more for me than trying to advance the common good in a world where I see very little good.
10544	If I say that advancing the common good is better than a personal pursuit, I would be lying to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that there are too many bad things happening in the world and what you do might not make a difference. A personal pursuit does more for you than trying to advance the common good in a world where you see very little good.
10545	I believe a personal pursuit is more beneficial. You cannot help others if you are not able to help yourself. If one's personal pursuit is to earn money for charity or the greater good, it starts with the person and their desire to make money. A personal pursuit is also about happiness, love, and success.
10546	I believe that a personal pursuit is better than a collective one, as it is important to help yourself before you can help others. It is important to have a sense of purpose and passion, which comes from within and can be directed towards money, happiness, love, or success.
10547	I think a personal pursuit is more beneficial as it allows you to help yourself first. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, it can start with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit is not always about money but can also be about happiness, love, and success.
10548	I believe that a personal pursuit is more effective than a collective one. You cannot help others if you are not able to help yourself. If one's personal pursuit is to make money to benefit the needy or the common good, it begins with oneself and their desire to make that money. A personal pursuit is not always about money, but can also be about happiness, love, and success.
10549	I believe a personal pursuit is more meaningful as it allows you to help yourself first, which can then lead to helping others. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the good of all, it starts with you and your desire to make that money. However, a personal pursuit can also be about happiness, love, and success.
10550	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; stop voting for pay raises for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world's peacekeepers and money controllers – both providing and then forgiving debt only to “loan” more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic.
10551	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which would be higher if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; stop voting for pay raises for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world’s peacekeepers and debt controllers; and recognize that all countries have the same potential and resources, and that countries must develop their own economy and workforce to reach their potential.
10552	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which would not be as high as it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along. We should stop voting for pay raises for our political leaders and realize that nations develop and grow when their people have the necessary resources to do so and the willingness to work and develop their abilities.
10553	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; stop voting for pay raises for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world's peacekeepers and money controllers—both providing and then forgiving debt only to “lend” more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic.
10554	Keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which would be higher if our governments had not introduced taxes and regulations; stop voting for higher taxes and higher wages for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world's policeman and economic controller; and realize that all countries have the same potential and resources, which can be developed if governments create an encouraging business environment.
10555	The Americans have been gunning for his death for some time, and the verdict will not be decided quickly. While Saddam is respected by some in Iraq, his death penalty could be a divisive issue, as seen with the recent bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis. Setting up courts outside of Iraq's borders could be problematic.
10556	The Americans have been pushing for his execution for some time now and have been trying to influence the tribunal to issue the death penalty. However, Saddam Hussein is still highly respected by many Iraqis, and the outcome of his trial is not likely to be decided quickly. Even so, the recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is related to Saddam's trial.
10557	The outcome of the trial will not be settled quickly. Saddam Hussein remains a feared and respected figure among many Iraqis. However, the Iraqi government and international community have differing opinions as to whether the death penalty should be imposed. This could cause tensions between countries, as the tribunal's decision will be respected by some but not by all.
10558	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will likely press for the death penalty. However, the outcome of his trial will not be decided quickly as the power to do so lies with the tribunal, which could take some time. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?"  Saddam has significant support among some Iraqis, which could complicate matters. The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is likely related to the trial, as Saddam's fate could decide the balance of power.
10559	The Americans have been pressing for his execution for some time and the tribunal will likely enforce the death penalty. However, Saddam is still seen as a feared and respected figure in Iraq, and his recent court appearances have had an effect on the situation in the country. Moreover, Saddam’s trial has been met with much resistance from various factions in Iraq, which could potentially have an impact on the situation in the country in the near future.
10560	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech is important, but it must be balanced with personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was still irresponsible. Even though the Islamic world overreacted, the cartoonist knew that these cartoons could cause trouble in extremist countries.   Do countries have the right to protect their culture and ideals, or do we risk limiting freedom of speech in this way?
10561	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech is important, but it should not be so wide-reaching as to infringe upon the rights of others. For example, while it is legal to produce those cartoons, the creator must take into account the possible consequences of their actions. Ultimately, it is up to the creator to decide whether or not to proceed.
10562	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be restricted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. While some countries have laws regulating speech, in general, these laws are necessary to ensure public safety and protect citizens from potential harm.   In addition, freedom of speech is closely tied to personal responsibility and accountability. While the cartoonist had the legal right to publish those cartoons, it was still an irresponsible decision as it could cause unrest in extremist countries. Ultimately, it depends on the government's interpretation of the law and the perceived threat of the speech.   Additionally, the Islamic world is overreacting in some cases, but I would argue that there are instances where they have a valid point and have a right to be concerned.
10563	Yes, freedom of speech should be respected, but it should also be balanced with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. While it was technically legal to publish those cartoons, it was still irresponsible. It could have caused problems in extremist countries, and that was the risk the cartoonist knew they ran. However, I also think that the Islamic world is overreacting and that their reaction could potentially damage their credibility and image.
10564	Yes, freedom of speech is an important right, but it must be balanced with individual responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was still irresponsible as it could cause unrest in extremist countries. However, I do not believe the Islamic world is overreacting; it shows how sensitive the issue of religion is. Moreover, Christian countries rarely experience such issues when it comes to religious beliefs being challenged.
10565	If an employer fires an employee, they must pay any owed wages plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) within a certain timeframe. As a manager, you are responsible for the employees under you and the money. Your boss must provide proof that the employee took the money in order to fire the employee, but the employee may be able to file a lawsuit for Wrongful Termination if they cannot do so.
10566	If an employer fires an employee, they must pay any owed wages plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) immediately. As a manager, you are responsible for the employee and the money. The employer must prove that the employee took the money in order to terminate employment, although the employee may be able to file a lawsuit for wrongful termination if they cannot do so.
10567	If an employer fires an employee, the employee is entitled to receive any wages owed plus any additional compensation such as vacation pay from the company on the spot. As a manager, the company is responsible for any employees and the money. The employer must demonstrate that the employee took the money in order to avoid termination. The employee may have the opportunity to file a claim with the state or federal Department of Labor.
10568	If an employer fires an employee, the employer is required to pay any wages owed plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) within a certain period of time. As a manager, you are responsible for the employees under you and the money. The employer has to prove that the employee took the money, but the employee may be able to get their job back through talks with either the State or Federal Department of Labor. The employee could also sue for Wrongful Termination if the employer is unable to prove the employee took the money.
10569	If an employer fires an employee, they are generally required to pay any wages owed plus any other compensation such as vacation pay within a reasonable period of time. As a manager, you are responsible for the employee and the money. The employer must demonstrate that the employee took the money in order to justify the termination. The employee may be able to pursue legal action against the employer if the termination is deemed to be wrongful.
10570	Reservation was introduced to help those from marginalized groups who were disadvantaged due to historical discrimination. It was hoped that this would provide these groups with an opportunity to rise out of poverty and achieve greater social and economic inclusion. There have been objections to reservation as some people feel that the benefits are not reaching the actual people in need, with some people in the higher strata of society taking advantage of it.  This has led to tension as people feel that the resources are not being properly utilized. It is important that the benefits of reservation reach those who need it most.
10571	No reservation system can be effective in helping those in need if it is not implemented or enforced in a fair and consistent manner. Implementation is key, and the effectiveness of reservation policies depends on how well they are tailored to the needs of the population they are intended to help. This can be difficult to assess in practice, leading to criticism that benefits are not reaching those who need it the most. As such, there is always potential for reservation policies to be criticised.
10572	Reservation was introduced to provide support to disadvantaged groups in society who need it in order to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. There have been both positive and negative reactions to reservation, as it has been seen to benefit a few people rather than those in need. While it is natural to want programs to directly benefit those who need it the most, it is important to ensure that the people who benefit are the actual ones in need. It is true that reservation has been implemented in India after years of lying in a bag, and it has been used to get quick votes.
10573	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India, reservation was introduced to provide social and economic justice to certain sections of society which were historically disadvantaged. This was done through the Constitution as well as the Mandal Commission. There are some aspects of reservation which have been opposed, such as the fact that the benefits are being taken up by some people, rather than going to the actual people who need it. However, this is not the case for all reservations, as there are some instances where the actual needy have been able to benefit.
10574	Reservation was introduced with the intention of providing equality of opportunity to disadvantaged groups and to help them get out of poverty and disadvantage. While reservation has positive aspects, there is opposition to it since the benefits are mainly taken by people who are already in the higher socio-economic strata, rather than reaching the actual people in need. It is true that there are people who need support to rise from their current status, and it is important that the benefits of reservation reach these people.
10575	If he is unhappy about your dogs, you have a few options. You could look for a good home for the dogs, train them, or move to a house in order to keep neighbourly peace. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Depending on the severity of the issue, you may want to look into training the dogs.
10576	If he is unhappy about your dogs, there are a few options you can consider. You could look for a good home for your dogs, train them, or find a way to ensure neighbourly peace. Ultimately, it is up to you. It is possible that he is gathering evidence that your dogs are behaving badly or too noisy; in this case, it might be a good idea to train the dogs. It could be difficult to live in a apartment, but this is the reality of apartment living. Working with neighbours can be challenging and going to the authorities might not solve anything.
10577	If he is unhappy with your dog's behaviour, you have several options. You can train your dog, relocate to a house or work with your neighbours to find a compromise that works for both parties. Ultimately, it is your decision. Depending on the severity of the problem, it may be necessary to train the dog or find a different living arrangement.
10578	If he is unhappy about your dogs, it may be a good idea to train the dogs if the behaviour is causing an issue. If it is an issue of noise, you could look into soundproofing or behavioural training for your dogs. If the dogs are too damaging the environment or posing a safety risk, it may be necessary to relocate them. You could also explore options such as relocation to another area or different types of housing that could work better for both you and your neighbors. Ultimately, the decision is yours.
10579	If he is unhappy about your dog's behavior, it is up to you to find a solution. Depending on the situation, you could train the dog, relocate to a house or work on improving neighborly relations. Each situation is different and it is up to you to decide which course of action to take.
10580	Blackmail is when someone threatens to reveal damaging information in order to obtain money or some other benefit. Here, the offer of not revealing the information is made in exchange for money, which could be seen as obtaining something by illegal means through force or coercion. I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl did not do anything illegal, it is not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
10581	Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarrassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act:  obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion.  Here there is neither force or coercion.  I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
10582	Blackmail is the act of using threatening or coercive tactics to obtain money or goods from someone, typically in exchange for silence on an embarrassing or damaging piece of information. Here, the threat of revealing the information could potentially be used as leverage, even if no force or coercion is used. While the police would not necessarily care about the situation, the threat is still real.
10583	Blackmail is the threat to reveal embarrassing or damaging information in order to obtain money or other benefits, either through legal or illegal means.  Here, there is the potential for the threat to be carried out as the information could be obtained. Thus, it could be seen as blackmail.
10584	Blackmail is the act of obtaining or procuring something, such as money or materials, through illegal means, such as force or coercion. Here, there is no force or coercion, so it is not blackmail exactly. However, one could argue that by offering the information for money, it could be.
10585	Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that can develop at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in childhood or early adolescence. It is caused by the body’s inability to produce insulin due to destruction of the cells in the pancreas that produce it. While it is true that type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, there are steps people can take to reduce the risk of complications. This includes maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring blood sugar levels.
10586	It is true that diabetes is a condition that can develop over time, but it is usually a result of a combination of lifestyle, genetics, and environment factors. The company is only responsible for any injury or illness sustained during the job, and the coverage for any illness may depend on the next job and the coverage provided by it.
10587	Diabetes is a long-term condition that can develop over time due to a number of risk factors. It is possible to get diabetes as a result of poor health habits, eating habits, or simple lack of exercise. In some cases, diabetes can be triggered by certain genetic factors or environmental conditions. While it is impossible to predict whether one will get diabetes or not, regular check-ups and health monitoring can help detect any potential health risks early on.
10588	Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that is typically diagnosed in children and young adults, and is caused by an autoimmune response, where the body attacks the pancreas and destroys the cells that produce insulin. While it is possible to develop type 1 diabetes due to genetic factors or environmental triggers, it is typically a condition that is built up over time.
10589	Type 1 diabetes is often triggered by a combination of genetic factors and environmental exposures, such as those related to diet and physical activity, which can increase the risk of developing the condition. As such, it is impossible to know for sure whether an individual may be predisposed to Type 1 diabetes without further testing.
10590	Elementary school children are growing up faster in terms of physical maturity, as some are able to dress and style their hair as adults. Additionally, they are exposed to more content such as death and sex at an earlier age through media, which can cause them to grow at a slower rate than their peers.
10591	Elementary school children are exposed to more stimulation at a younger age than before, leading to accelerated physical and emotional growth. While kids may appear more mature physically due to this increased stimulation, they still grow at a natural pace.
10592	Elementary school children are often exposed to contemporary trends and fashions at a younger age, making it seem like they are maturing faster. While they may have access to electronic gadgets at an earlier age, they still grow up at a natural pace, with the proper support and care of their environment.
10593	Elementary school children are often required to wear clothing, makeup, and accessories that are popular among adults, as well as use electronic gadgets at an earlier age than in the past, which may accelerate their physical development. This can lead to a sense of disconnection between their physical and mental maturity, as the latter may catch up slower than the former.
10594	Children are increasingly exposed to adult content at an earlier age due to their access to technology. This can lead to an accelerated physical development, but emotional maturity may take longer to catch up.
10595	In some cases, it may be necessary to override individual civil liberties for the greater good of the community. While this can raise ethical concerns, in some situations it may be necessary to make these sacrifices in order to protect the rights of the majority.
10596	I can't find any good ethical arguments. While it may be beneficial in some situations to override individual rights for the greater good, there is still a risk of losing sight of individual rights and liberties, which could lead to potential abuse and a lack of trust in the system. Additionally, it could easily be abused to justify actions that are not in the best interest of the public.
10597	I can't find any good ethical arguments for violating the US Constitution in order to enact a particular policy. While this may be necessary for the greater good in certain situations, it is still a intrusive and powerful step to take. Even when it is necessary, it can have serious implications for individuals' rights and liberties.
10598	I believe that in some instances, the collective good of a society can justify intrusions on individual liberties, such as with respect to surveillance or other restrictions on personal freedom, in order to keep the general population safe. However, I recognize that such decisions are often controversial and require careful consideration and evaluation of the merits and drawbacks of both options.
10599	I would argue that limiting individual liberty in certain situations can be ethically justified, if it is determined that it is necessary for the greater good of the community or society as a whole. While it is important to consider the potential implications of limiting individual freedoms, it can be justified if it is deemed necessary for the greater good.
10600	White males are becoming less common in the workforce, which could lead to greater legal protections for other groups in the future. While I believe that ability to perform a job should be the only factor considered when hiring, I believe that equality in the workplace should be ensured by legislation.
10601	white males are slowly becoming the minority, and I think laws should be in place to protect all groups of individuals, regardless of gender or race. If an individual can perform the job well, they should be able to get paid for it.
10602	Women and minority groups are becoming an increasingly larger part of the workforce, which could potentially lead to laws protecting these groups in the future. I believe that if someone is able to do the job well and meets the requirements, they should be hired regardless of gender, ethnicity or other factors.
10603	White males are slowly becoming the minority, and while I agree that there should not be laws protecting any particular group, if an individual is able to do the job well and meets the requirements, they should be hired regardless of gender, race or other factors.
10604	As the population shifts, white males will become less dominant in the workforce, but laws protecting specific groups are generally not ideal. If someone can do the job well and earn a living wage, then their gender, race, or other characteristics should not matter.
10605	For the same reason you have to pay for hair cuts, lawyers services, tax services, and doctors visits, there are costs incurred in providing a service, such as staff salaries, which are paid for by the school in order to provide the service to the client. In this way, the school is able to charge tuition in order to cover these costs. The tuition fee the school charges serves to compensate the school for its costs.
10606	For the same reason you have to pay for hair cuts, lawyers services, tax services, and doctors visits, there are expenses incurred in providing a service including salaries.  Schools, like businesses, provide services to their clients (students) and charge tuition fees in order to cover the costs of providing education.
10607	As with any service, there are costs associated with providing education, such as staff salaries and facilities which are paid for by the school. This is why tuition is necessary to cover the cost of education, as the student receives the majority of the benefit from the education provided.
10608	Schools need money to pay for services such as teaching, which students pay for through tuition fees. The fees cover the costs of providing the education, as the student is the one who benefits from it.
10609	The cost of providing a service often includes costs such as salaries, so there are expenses incurred when providing an education. This means that school tuition fees must be paid in order for the student to benefit from the education.
10610	The idea behind freedom of speech is that people are able to express their opinions and ideas without fear of government restriction, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. While this provides some protection, laws can be restricted in some countries more than others. In the United States, our rights to freedom of expression are generally more extensive than in other countries, which makes it a better environment for speech than many others.
10611	The idea behind freedom of speech is that individuals are able to express their opinions and ideas without fear of government interference, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. While the United States provides greater liberties when it comes to speech than many other countries, there is a limit to how far these rights extend. Ultimately, people need to ensure that their actions are within boundaries. Furthermore, the United States offers more liberties than most other countries, but it is still important to consider the impact of speech on the rights of others.
10612	The right to freedom of speech is a vital part of democratic societies, as individuals are able to voice their opinions and criticisms without fear of reprisal. While there is a limit to what can be said, this is generally determined on a case-by-case basis to prevent harm to others. The US offers more freedoms compared to many other countries, although this is subject to variation depending on location.
10613	The idea behind freedom of speech is that people can express their opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. While the US provides greater protection for free speech than most other countries, it is still important to ensure that actions are limited to speech. The US provides greater protection for free speech than most other countries, which allows people to voice their opinions without fear of reprisal.
10614	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can express your opinion without fear of government interference, as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. While this is generally true, people sometimes fail to recognize that actions have consequences and that different countries have different levels of freedom. The US provides more freedom than most other countries, but it is still possible to run into issues.
10615	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible.  If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him.   In some cases, the police may be able to ticket the driver if they believe the speed is dangerous. However, there is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas in order for the delivery to occur. It is important to keep in mind that the faster the delivery, the better (as long as nobody gets injured).
10616	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible.  If he is speeding or driving recklessly, the police can ticket him.  However, speed limits are set in place to keep drivers and passengers safe, so it is important to ensure safety by following the speed limit.
10617	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible.  If he is speeding or driving recklessly, the police can ticket him.  In general, the faster the delivery, the better, although this may depend on the circumstances and road conditions.  There is no law that requires the restaurant to hold back pizzas in order for delivery, as this goes against the customer service guidelines.
10618	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible.  If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him.  However, the police are within their rights to ticket the driver if the speed is above the legal limit.  In general, speed limits are set to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers, so authorities will enforce these laws in order to keep everyone safe.
10619	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible.  If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him.  Additionally, the restaurant may choose to keep the pizzas warm for a short period of time, but if the driver has to travel far, the pizzas may not stay warm for long.  Ultimately, it is up to the restaurant whether or not they are able to deliver the pizzas quickly.
10620	They are allowed to practice their religion and build mosques anywhere in the country, and Muslims are also able to live in communities of their own choice. Moreover, they have the freedom to choose how they worship and the government generally respects this right. Although the government generally allows freedom of speech and practice, some restrictions are placed on activities that could offend Muslims. Additionally, the government allows non-Muslims to receive benefits such as healthcare and housing.
10621	They are allowed to practice their religion freely in the Netherlands, with the government providing support for Muslim communities in terms of language learning and access to welfare benefits. However, Muslims are now demanding separate statehood and autonomy, which has been met with resistance from some European countries due to concerns about the potential impact on the local population and culture.
10622	They are allowed to build mosques and live according to their own beliefs in certain areas of the country, and Muslims are also free to live in segregated communities if they choose to. Additionally, Muslims have the right to access benefits in the host country, despite language barriers. This shows the government's respect for religious and cultural diversity.
10623	They are allowed to practice their religion freely in the majority Christian countries they migrate to, and the governments generally respect their right to live according to their culture and faith. While some Muslim leaders have called for separate communities in some countries, this has generally been met with resistance from the government, as there is a fear of isolating these communities and denying them access to wider society.  Additionally, some Muslims have used the generosity of the host countries to demand benefits from the government, such as free healthcare and welfare, without having to integrate or learn the language.
10624	They are allowed to freely practice their religion in the majority Christian countries, and Muslims have the right to build mosques and live in segregated communities if they choose to do so. Furthermore, Muslims are allowed to benefit from the health and welfare services of the host country, even if they do not speak the language. This reflects the countries’ generosity and respect for their religious diversity.
10625	Incest is not as common in the United States as people think, but it does occur in some cultures and ethnic groups more often than others. It is more common in the South, as well as among Hispanics. These statistics suggest that incest is increasingly occurring in Central and South America as well. While incest can involve consenting adults, it is important to keep in mind that laws regarding incestuous relationships still vary between states.
10626	In the USA, incest is not common. Although it does occur among some populations, these instances are relatively rare. Additionally, rates of incest are highest among Hispanic communities in the United States.
10627	While incest is not as common as other relationship types, it does occur among consenting adults in some parts of the world. In the United States, the highest incidence of incest is found among Hispanic populations. Furthermore, incest is also common in some Central and South American countries.
10628	Incest between consenting adults is not common in the United States, although there is a stereotype that it occurs more frequently in the South. In fact, the highest rates of incest in the country are found among Hispanic populations. Central and South America have higher incest rates than the United States.
10629	In the United States, incest is not particularly common, though it does occur among certain populations. Generally, incest is less common in areas with larger Hispanic populations. In other regions, rates of incest are generally similar to the national average.
10630	Brian Doyle should have received a harsher penalty since his crime was particularly serious. Although law enforcement is able to obtain convictions, it can be difficult due to the legal loopholes created by lawyers in the U.S. It is understandable that people feel that way, as law enforcement should be able to take stronger action when it comes to such crimes. I believe that the penalty given to Doyle was reasonable, given the seriousness of his crime.
10631	Brian Doyle was fortunate to receive a sentence that took into account his circumstances and enabled him to receive the treatment he needed. Without law enforcement having the ability to take swift action, criminals would be able to operate more freely in our society. It is difficult enough to obtain convictions with all the legal loopholes created by attorneys in our country, particularly when it comes to serious offenses. I am sure that if it were your daughter who was being sexually assaulted by this person, you would be demanding that law enforcement take action faster. Do not confuse the issues; it is clear that Doyle was a pedophile who preyed on children.
10632	Brian Doyle could have faced more serious penalties if convicted of the crime, but law enforcement was able to apprehend him before any serious harm was done. Law enforcement plays an important role in keeping communities safe, and while it may be difficult to obtain convictions due to legal loopholes, sentences for offenders can still be served. Doyle's crime was especially heinous as it involved preying on children.
10633	Brian Doyle was fortunate to receive a lenient sentence as law enforcement is often able to obtain convictions for such illicit behavior, given the legal loopholes created by our legal system. While it is difficult to put perpetrators of such crimes behind bars, Doyle's sentence was commensurate with the crime and the severity of the punishment was appropriate in this case. Doyle should have served more time in order to act as a deterrent and protect society.
10634	Brian Doyle did not only get what he deserved; he should have gotten more time behind bars. Without law enforcement having the power to improvise, criminals would be more likely to run amok in the country. It can be difficult to secure convictions with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in the US, which is made worse by the leniency of some judges. I assure you, if it was your daughter who was being sexually assaulted by this guy, you would be outraged and would hold law enforcement responsible. Doyle was a pedophile who preyed on children; he should have received a longer prison sentence.
10635	No, I have not done any research into free or low-cost legal assistance options yet, but it sounds like there may be options available. Many legal aid organizations offer help based on income and family size, and my sister’s family is able to receive assistance through their state's health and nutrition programs. It is surprising how much assistance is available.  My sister's husband brings home around $400-$600 a week in the winter and summer, which is enough to get by comfortably.
10636	Yes, my sister has been able to find help through pro bono places and legal services. My sister's husband earns $400-$600 a week in the winter and $600-$800 in the summer, and their household income is around $46,000. They are able to get assistance from WIC, daycare assistance, and food stamps.
10637	No, she has not been able to find help yet, but there are a number of resources that provide legal assistance at reduced costs or for free, such as pro bono programs and legal services for low-income individuals. It may surprise her to learn that some organizations define low income differently, depending on the area. My sister’s husband earns around $400-$600 per week in the winter and $600-$800 in the summer, and they have a three-person household. They bring home approximately $46,000 a year and get help from WIC, daycare assistance, and other programs.
10638	No, I haven't done legal aid for her yet, but there may be options available. Many states have legal aid organizations that provide free or low-cost legal services to those who qualify, and most states also have income-based guidelines for programs such as WIC and daycare assistance. I would suggest looking into these options to see if she is eligible.
10639	I haven't personally experienced this situation, but it sounds like there are options available to her in terms of pro bono legal services or low-income based legal services. Legal aid can be surprisingly accessible; I know from experience that some places provide assistance at lower incomes. My sister's husband brings home around $400-$600 a week in the winter, and $600-$800 in the summer, and they have a three-person household. They get approximately $46,000 a year, which is enough for them to get help from WIC, Daycare Assistance, and other such programs.
10640	While it is generally best to take certain steps to ensure your safety, such as wearing a seatbelt, it is up to individuals to decide how to best protect themselves. Having laws in place that require seatbelts can be beneficial, but it is ultimately up to individuals to decide what is best for them. It is a matter of personal choice.
10641	I believe we have the right balance between personal freedom and government regulation in our country. People should have the right choice to make decisions regarding their health and safety, but the government can provide support and education to encourage people to take steps to improve their health and reduce risks.
10642	I believe that individuals should have the right to decide how to protect themselves, and that the government should not require people to wear seatbelts or follow any particular regulations, but it is better for individuals to make their own choices in these matters.
10643	While it is true that we have the right to make our own choices in life, some laws are put in place to ensure our safety and the safety of others. Wearing a seatbelt, for instance, can save lives in the event of an accident, so it is better to wear a seatbelt than not. This is no different than following other safety protocols such as wearing a helmet when riding a bike or using a child seat in a car. In this way, the government is simply making it easier for us to take precautions that could save our lives.
10644	We have a variety of laws in place to promote public safety, such as mandatory seatbelt laws, which are designed to protect individuals and reduce the risk of injury or death in car accidents. It is understandable that individuals may feel wary of the possibility of an increased intrusion of the government into citizens' lives, although the laws are still ultimately in place to keep people safe. Ultimately, individuals should take precautions to protect their own safety.
10645	It is important to have laws in place to provide protection for society and to act as a deterrent for potentially dangerous activities. While penalties and laws can act as a deterrent, it does not necessarily mean that an activity is right. There are a number of factors which need to be taken into consideration when determining punishments, such as the severity of the crime and the intent of the perpetrator.
10646	YES!  What good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free?  Throwing drug users in prison can have consequences that often outweigh the benefits, particularly for non-violent offences.  While some states have decriminalized certain drugs, the laws in place are generally there for a reason.  Marijuana may be legal in some states now, but laws are still in place in most parts of the US.  It is important to consider the implications of these laws and the effects they could have on users.
10647	NO!  Although it is legal in some states, marijuana is still illegal under federal law. Therefore, the government has the right to enforce laws regarding its use and possession. This ensures public safety and welfare. While marijuana may become more accepting in some states, it is important to note that its use and possession remain illegal in many parts of the US. It is essential that we consider the legal restrictions in place to ensure public safety and welfare.
10648	YES!  What good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free?  Throwing marijuana users in prison can have serious consequences and is generally discouraged as it is believed that it does more harm than good.  In some states, marijuana laws are becoming more relaxed, but it is important to be aware of the laws in each region.  NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, is a good source of information in this regard.
10649	YES!  The legalization of marijuana is an increasingly popular movement, as many states have begun to recognize the drug's potential medical benefits and have begun to legalize its use in some form. While this is a positive development, it is important to remember that marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which could still lead to criminal charges in some instances. To better inform the public of these changing laws and their implications, NORML (the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) is a good resource to explore.
10650	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not always included, as evidenced by the US Constitution, which did not provide rights to women. Although human rights discussions include women and address gender-specific issues, these issues have not yet been fully recognized or enjoyed by women.
10651	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were often excluded from having their rights specifically addressed. This was particularly true when it came to issues such as childbearing, sexual abuse, and cultural traditions that oppressed women's rights. Human rights in general are not always seen as addressing women's issues as specifically as men's.
10652	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were often excluded from the rights afforded to citizens in the newly-established countries. Although the rights of women are now more often included in these discussions, women's rights are still not always seen as being addressed by human rights in general. This is due to issues such as child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions or laws which can prevent women from enjoying the same rights as men.
10653	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not always included, as seen in the case of the US Constitution, which did not always protect and preserve women's rights. It was only through struggle that their rights as citizens were recognized. Although human rights discussions now include women, there are still issues specific to the female gender, such as child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions and laws that limit women's enjoyment of their rights.   Therefore, human rights may not always fully address these issues.   This indicates that women's rights are still not fully recognized in the context of human rights, thus emphasizing the need for more specific protection for women.
10654	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not always included, as their rights were not fully recognized and protected in the same way as men. Women had to struggle to have their rights as citizens acknowledged. This could be seen in the case of the US Constitution, which was created to protect and preserve the rights of US citizens, although this document did not always recognize the rights of women. Cultural and legal traditions were often an obstacle to women enjoying the same rights as men.
10655	I believe it could be argued that women in many parts of the world, including the United States, are subject to gender-based inequality and discrimination in terms of pay, education, and access to resources. This is due to the pervasive gender norms that favor men in terms of power and opportunities. This leaves women at a disadvantage, resulting in the gender wage gap and other issues highlighted.
10656	I believe it could be argued that we already exist in a world that is largely shaped by gender inequalities, especially in terms of economic opportunities and wages. For example, in the United States, women earn only 75 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, whereas 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women. Similarly, two-thirds of the world’s 900 million illiterate adults are women, despite the fact that they work two-thirds of the world’s working hours and produce half the world’s food. These facts demonstrate that there is a significant gender gap in terms of economic opportunities and income.
10657	I think it could be argued that we already exist in a world where gender inequality is a major issue:   - In the United States, women are paid only 75¢ for every $1.00 a man is paid for the same work (although the gap is narrowing).  - 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women.  - Two-thirds of the children denied even elementary education are girls.  - Women work over two-thirds of the world’s working hours and produce half the world’s food, yet own less than 1% of the world’s property.
10658	I believe it could be argued that we already exist in a world where gender inequality is a major issue, particularly in terms of economic opportunities, educational attainment and property rights for women.  In the United States, women earn only 75% of what men earn for the same work, 70% of the world’s 1.3 billion people living in poverty are women, two-thirds of children denied education are girls, 75% of the world’s illiterate adults are women and women work two-thirds of the world’s working hours yet produce half the world’s food, yet own less than 1% of the world’s property.  Such statistics point to the fact that there is clearly an existing gender inequality which should be addressed.  Thus, I believe there is a need for gender equality movements like feminism to raise awareness and promote change.
10659	i believe it could be argued that we already exist in a world that disproportionately limits women's opportunities and rights when compared to men.  In the United States, women are paid only 79 cents for every dollar a man is paid for the same work,  despite composing 51% of the workforce.  In addition,  girls’ education is often inferior to boys’, with two-thirds of the world’s 1.3 billion poor people being women.
10660	If you are caught sneaking into a film, the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is against the law, as it is stealing. If you paid to see one film and then sneak in to see a second film, you have still deprived the theater of ticket sales and have affected the box office totals for the film.
10661	If you get caught, the theater manager may choose to remove you from the theater or ban you from returning depending on the policy of the theater.  This is dishonest-- it is stealing.  If you paid to see one film and then sneak in to see a second film, the theater could lose revenue from the second film due to ticket sales.
10662	If you are caught sneaking into a movie, the theater manager may choose to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from returning. This is against the law and can lead to consequences for the theater, as ticket sales may be affected. The theater has the discretion to take action depending on the situation. It is still wrong to sneak into a movie, even if it is common practice.
10663	If you get caught, the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back.  This is against the law, as it is stealing.  If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cost the theater income from ticket sales.  Additionally, it could also affect the box office totals for the film you saw.
10664	If you get caught, the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back.  This is dishonest— stealing. If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, you have cost the theater ticket sales and may have affected the box office totals for the film you saw. This is still against the law, even if it happens often and the theater manager is able to enforce it in some cases.
10665	The principle here is that those who have committed heinous crimes forfeit their right to live under the law’s protection, as their actions pose a threat to the general populace. If such individuals are set free and go on to cause further deaths, it is justified to take their life in order to protect society. Executions are an alternative to violence, although random and senseless violence is still a valid form of punishment. War and regime change is a different matter, depending on the reasons and whether it is to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
10666	The principle here is that the government is able to take a life if it deems it necessary in order to protect the general public. Capital punishment is allowed in some cases to uphold justice and ensure public safety. However, executions of known felons who have committed multiple murders have forfeited their right to life in the eyes of the law. If they were to be set free and potentially cause more deaths, it is justified to take their life for the general good.
10667	The principle here is that the government has the right to take a person’s life in certain cases if it is deemed necessary to protect the population. Executions of known felons who have committed multiple murders have forfeited their right to live under the law’s eyes. While it is understandable that this can result in violence, the government is justified in taking their lives in order to prevent further deaths. This is not a crime nor hypocrisy; it is justified and necessary. As for war, it depends on the reason and the government’s intention; in some cases, it is an honourable cause to defend life and freedom, while in other cases it is a self-centered hypocrisy.
10668	The principle here is that an individual who has taken innocent life is forfeiting their right to live under the law's protection; if they are released and pose a threat of causing more deaths, it is justified to take their life in order to protect the general population. Executions of convicted criminals are allowed in certain circumstances in order to deter crime. Wars are sometimes necessary to defend life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
10669	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has committed heinous crimes can be justified if it is seen as a necessary measure to protect the community as a whole. It is important to maintain law and order, and to uphold the morality and stability of a society. If released, the individual may go on to cause more deaths, which is not acceptable. In some cases, executions are justified and necessary. For war and to defend life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it may be seen as a necessary measure.
10670	If he prescribed the medication, he would be responsible for maintaining the records since it is the patient’s right to access their medical records. Whatever the case, the patient’s access to the records is guaranteed by federal law. It is ultimately the facility’s responsibility to maintain the records.  Generally, I agree with this.  The law would still apply in his case.
10671	If the prescribing doctor is legally responsible for the medications, it is likely that the facility where the medications are stored is also responsible for maintaining the records. The patient’s access to their medical records is guaranteed by federal law, although the facility may be held responsible for ensuring access.  This could include the facility where the medications are stored, as well as the doctor in charge of prescribing them.  In general, I agree with this.
10672	If the prescribing doctor is legally responsible for the medications, it is likely that the doctor has access to and control over the medical records.  Under federal law, patients have the right to access their medical records.  The facility would be responsible for maintaining these records.  Generally, I agree with this.
10673	If he prescribed the medication, he would bear the legal responsibility for it. However, it is possible that he does not actually have access to the records. The patient's access to their medical records is guaranteed by federal law. Depending on the state, the facility's owner could be held responsible for maintaining the records.  In general, I agree with these other guidelines.
10674	If the prescribing doctor has legal responsibility for the medication, it is possible that the doctor may not have access to the medical records.  Under federal law, patients have access to their medical records.  The facility would be responsible for maintaining these records.    In general, I agree with these other guys.  The doctor is likely trying to avoid responsibility, but the patient is ultimately responsible for the medication.  It is important to ensure the patient has access to their records.
10675	I believe that birth mothers should have the right to decline contact, with an intermediary available in the event of a medical emergency. This gives women the necessary protection against feeling pressured by others' judgmental attitudes towards their pregnancy, which can often lead to abortion.
10676	I believe the birth mother should have the right to choose no contact, with an intermediary contact able to be made in the event of a medical emergency. Women should have this safeguard in place to avoid feeling pressured by judgemental attitudes towards their pregnancy, which can often lead to abortion.
10677	I believe the birth mother should have the right to choose "no contact" at all. There should be an intermediary contact point however, in the event of a medical emergency, to ensure the birth mother feels secure without any external pressure. In certain situations such as these, abortion is often a sad choice.
10678	I believe the birth mother should have the right to decide whether there is any contact at all between her and the child. In cases where contact with the child is allowed, an intermediary should be able to be contacted in the event of a medical emergency.  Women should have this safeguard in place in order to prevent them from feeling pressured by the judgemental attitudes of others regarding their unwanted pregnancy. It is unfortunate that abortion is sometimes the only choice available.
10679	I believe the birth mother should have the right to opt for no contact, with the option of an intermediary being contacted in the event of a medical emergency. This ensures that the birth mother feels secure and is not pressured by the judgement of others. It is unfortunate that in many cases, abortion is the only choice available due to this pressure.
10680	I disagree as I have worked hard to achieve financial success. I understand that success does not come easily and that one needs to work for it. I have created a better life for myself and that is something I have earned through my own effort. I am willing to defend it as I view it as my achievement.
10681	I disagree as I have worked hard to succeed and create financial security for myself. Growing up in a disadvantaged environment, I have achieved financial independence and control over my life and destiny. I will defend these achievements at all costs.
10682	I disagree because while I had some challenges growing up, I was able to obtain a good education and build wealth for myself. I have worked hard for what I have and I will defend it.
10683	I disagree as I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to succeed and I have worked hard to achieve financial security. I will defend my achievements and won't hesitate to take legal steps to protect what I have earned.
10684	I disagree because, while I had a difficult upbringing, I have since been able to create a life for myself, where I have achieved some success. I believe that my success is a result of my hard work, and I refuse to have my accomplishments taken away from me.
10685	The Scarlet Letter license plates will not pass in many states because some officials, such as those with high political offices or other esteemed jobs, have been caught violating the law. This has resulted in the bill repeatedly being defeated. If it was just an ordinary person who was being punished for the DUIs, this bill may have a higher chance of passing.
10686	The Scarlet Letter license plates may not pass due to the fear that it could potentially attract higher levels of law enforcement attention, particularly for those with higher political or other esteemed positions. This has limited its chances of being enacted in the past, as it has been defeated repeatedly. If it was just Joe Smoe who was being caught for DUIs instead of senators, congressmen, etc., it might be more accepted.
10687	The passage of the Scarlet Letter license plates could be affected by the fact that there are some individuals who hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs who have been caught for this offense. Although it is possible that it could pass if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for DUIs, it is possible that it could be defeated in the legislature due to this.
10688	The reason the Scarlet Letter license plates have been consistently defeated in the past is that there are those who hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs who have been caught for it. It is possible that these plates could act as a deterrent, but it is also possible that the bill could be defeated in areas where lawmakers and legislators are concerned. This could potentially be an issue in areas where the upper class is more heavily represented.
10689	The Scarlet Letter license plates may not pass because there are those who hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for this reason. Do you think they want to drive around with a Scarlet Letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has been repeatedly defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was being busted for DUIs, instead of Senators, Congressmen, etc., I think it would pass.
10690	Many believe that if he does raise taxes, it could have a negative effect on the economy, especially for the working middle class and lower-income earners. This could cause a further downturn in the economy, which would be worse for the US.  However, the effect of higher taxes could be mitigated by increased government spending, which could help to minimize the impact on the economy.
10691	Many people worry that if he is raised taxes, it could cause considerable economic harm to the United States. This is due to the fact that the taxation system in America is designed in such a way that higher taxes would be passed on to consumers, thus negatively affecting consumer spending and businesses’ profits. This could result in a decrease in wages and employment levels among the working and middle class, potentially leading to a decrease in overall economic growth.
10692	Many wish he would be; however, if he does, there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower brackets. The economy of the US would be negatively affected or even lowered than it already is. Bush is using the "Born Again" church to his advantage, though whether he is a Christian is questionable.
10693	Many wish that higher taxes would not be needed to fund his initiatives, but if he does so, there would be increased pressure on the economy. This would lead to a decrease in the standard of living for many Americans, especially those in the middle and lower income brackets. The US economy could suffer greatly in this situation. Thus, his initiatives could negatively impact the economy.
10694	Many wish he would be, as there would be great uproar if he does. The American public, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners, would suffer greatly. The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even lowered further than it currently is. Bush is using the 'Born again church' to his advantage, which is questionable with regards to his faith.
10695	No one should be treated differently based on their age, gender, race, or other factors outside of an individual's control. We are all created equal and should be valued for our own capabilities and contributions, not merely our ancestry or background. We should not be discriminated against or scapegoated, regardless of our age, sex, or physical ability. Every person matters and every vote should count, regardless of one's ancestry or background.
10696	No one should be treated differently solely on the basis of their characteristics at birth, such as sex or race. Ultimately, it is what someone chooses to do with their life that determines their worth, not their genetic makeup. Every person has equal value and worth, regardless of their background. All people should be afforded equal opportunities and protection from discrimination.
10697	No one should be treated differently simply because of factors they have no control over, such as their gender, race, or age. Every person matters, regardless of their background or ability. Everyone has the right to be judged on their own abilities and qualifications, rather than their physical characteristics. This applies to all people, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, or ancestry. Everyone should have an equal vote in how their society, community, and nation is shaped.
10698	Every person has the right to be treated equally and regardless of factors such as gender, race, or age. These factors should not determine one’s worth, but rather one’s choices in life. Every person matters and has the right to vote on the society, community and nation they live in.
10699	No one should be treated differently based on characteristics such as gender, race, or age. People should be valued for their choices and abilities, not their birth circumstances. Every person has equal value and deserves to be respected and treated equally. Every individual has a right to participate in and shape the society, community and nation.
10700	I believe that the government should have some input on what people can and cannot eat. While some people may be able to buy healthier food, there are others who buy junk food and drinks that are high in sugar, salt and calories. This can lead to obesity, which is a growing issue in the US. It may be beneficial to pass laws that make exercise and health and nutrition classes mandatory to help create healthier habits among the population. This can help ensure that people are eating healthier and more nutritious foods.
10701	I think it sounds like we are becoming an intrusive government that wants to pass laws regulating what people can and cannot buy. Eating habits are a complex issue, and while there are many factors that contribute to obesity, diet is only one of them. Some people may purchase healthy food but can still be vulnerable to illnesses due to poor nutrition. Additionally, some may be able to afford healthy food while others may find it more expensive. We could potentially address this issue by making fresh fruits and vegetables more affordable, requiring nutrition and health education in schools, or even making exercise mandatory.
10702	I think it sounds like we are becoming an increasingly regulatory country when it comes to food laws. I understand that the government wants to promote healthy eating habits and reduce obesity, but regulations can go too far in telling people what they can and cannot purchase with their own money. While limits can be put on junk food consumption and sugar/fat intake, it is not the government’s place to make these choices for citizens. Moreover, other issues like lack of exercise and poor nutrition should be addressed through educational programs and access to healthy food, rather than laws.
10703	I think it sounds like the government is trying to regulate what people can and cannot spend on food, which could potentially infringe on people's rights to make their own food choices. Although there are some health issues associated with obesity, the government should not interfere in people's food choices, as there are many other factors that contribute to obesity, such as diet and exercise. Education and legislation that encourages healthier diets and more exercise could be more effective ways to tackle the issue.
10704	I think it sounds like we are becoming an authoritarian country by trying to pass a law like that. Our government thinks it can dictate what people can and cannot spend on food, which is partially true.  Food choices are a complex issue and some people may be able to afford healthy food, but slim-fast and other processed foods are often cheaper. Similarly, exercise is an option for some, but not for everyone. We could make health and nutrition classes more accessible, but that is a long-term solution. There should be more focus on making organic and natural food more affordable.
10705	Given that parenting after separation or divorce can be challenging, it is important to have a parenting plan in place to ensure the best interests of the child. It is recommended that the parents work together, either directly or through a court, to create a plan that takes into account the needs of the child and the parents.
10706	Proof that the other parent is a FELON or is commiting FELONIES right now can be hard to establish, as courts usually view joint custody as in the child's best interests, unless there is clear evidence that the parent is an unfit parent or is in the process of committing crimes.
10707	Proof that the other parent is a suitable caregiver is often required in order to ensure a child's best interests are met, especially in cases where the parents have split custody. This can be done through assessments that look at the parent's ability to provide for the child's needs and the child's development.
10708	It is understandable to have concerns about shared parenting with an ex-partner, especially if there are worries about the other parent's ability to care for the child or possible criminal activity. While this can be difficult to prove, it is essential that the court is made aware of the concerns in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the child.
10709	Given that shared parenting after a separation can be difficult, it is important for courts to ensure that a child’s best interests are taken into account. It is therefore necessary to have some form of evidence to show that a parent is not deemed fit by the court. This could be through assessing past records or any issues that may have been observed during parenting time.
10710	Well, a private attorney in a murder case can cost anywhere between $30,000 to $50,000.  If you do not have this kind of money, it may be difficult to find legal representation.  Public defenders, while generally decent attorneys, can be overworked which reduces the time they can dedicate to cases.
10711	The cost of hiring a private attorney in a murder case can range from $30,000 to $50,000. If the defendant does not have this amount of money, they may not have a choice. Public defenders are generally decent attorneys, but their workload can be overwhelming, limiting their time and effort on even the most important cases.
10712	Well, a private attorney in a murder case can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000. If you do not have this kind of money, you may have to use a public defender, who while being decent enough attorneys, can be overworked and therefore have less time to dedicate to even the most important cases.
10713	Well, a private attorney in a murder case can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000.  If the defendant does not have this amount of money, they may have limited options.  Meanwhile, public defenders are generally decent attorneys, though their workload can be an issue; they may have less time to devote to even the most important cases.
10714	Well, a private attorney in a murder case can cost up to $50,000.  This can be prohibitively expensive for those who do not have that amount of money.  However, public defenders are generally good attorneys, though they may be overworked, which limits their time spent on cases.
10715	You are correct that, absent service of process laws being circumvented, divorce proceedings generally must be commenced in the jurisdiction where the marriage took place. However, some jurisdictions may accept filings from other states, allowing for service to be effected by publication if the respondent cannot be located. Initiating the proceedings yourself would enable service by publication and a grant of the divorce.
10716	You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served with court documents, you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney who was able to circumvent the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce somewhere without you knowing. However, this is unlikely and there is no easy way to find out. If you want to be divorced, your best option is to initiate the divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband through publication if he cannot be located, and you will be granted a divorce.
10717	It is possible to be granted a divorce without being served court documents if an attorney finds a way around the service of process laws. It is still possible that your husband could have been granted a divorce without you knowing. To be sure, it may be necessary to hire an attorney or a private investigator to track him down. Initiating divorce proceedings yourself is the best way to ensure a divorce is granted.
10718	It is possible to obtain a divorce without being served court documents, depending on the state's laws. If you initiate the divorce proceedings, your attorney can attempt service by publication if your spouse cannot be located, which would allow you to get a divorce.
10719	It is possible to be granted a divorce without being served documents, especially if the divorce has been granted somewhere else. To initiate divorce proceedings yourself and have your attorney serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located can result in a divorce decree.
10720	First of all, what your stepson is doing is defamation, as it is in written form. Slander is oral, but since he is sending letters, it is defamation.    If you are serious about stopping him, you should begin by contacting the police. Defamation laws vary from state to state, and they will be able to provide more information on the matter.    If it is a civil matter, it may be worth speaking to an attorney to consider the pros and cons of bringing a case against your stepson and the likely outcome.
10721	First of all, what your stepson is doing is considered defamation, as it is in written form. Slander is oral, while libel is written communication that can be published or electronically shared, so it is more likely to be a criminal matter in New York.    If you are serious about stopping him, you should start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state and it will depend on the jurisdiction. You should speak with an attorney to better understand the laws in your state. If it is a civil matter, you should consider hiring an attorney to help you evaluate the situation and the potential outcomes.
10722	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may be doing, but since it is in the form of letters, it is considered libel under the law. Libel laws vary from state to state, and the police may be able to provide more information on the matter.
10723	First of all, what your stepson is doing is defamation, as it is in written form. Slander is oral, but since he is sending letters, it is defamation. Libel laws vary from state to state, and it may not be a criminal matter in New York.   If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
10724	First of all, what your stepson is doing is considered defamation, as it is in written form. Slander is generally oral, but since he is sending letters, it is considered defamation.  Libel laws vary from state to state, so it is possible that it may not be a criminal matter in New York, and the police will be able to advise you on this.    If it is a civil matter, consulting an attorney is recommended to understand your options and the potential outcome. This may not be worth the time, effort and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
10725	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People who are successful in life are typically successful due to their ability to take risks and go after what they want. This can mean taking advantage of opportunities that present themselves, rather than relying on existing within an established system.
10726	It is true that you can be a kind, compassionate person and still experience difficult situations in life, but it is also possible to be successful by taking opportunities and playing to win. Although this can happen, it is not necessarily the case that those who are successful in life do so because they took what they wanted and played to win. Other factors such as having strong determination and resilience can be equally important.
10727	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People who are successful in life often do so by taking risks and playing to win. This does not guarantee success as outcomes are not always fair.
10728	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still achieve success. People who are successful in life often do so by taking risks and playing to win. This could mean taking advantage of opportunities that present themselves, rather than relying on long term planning.
10729	You can take an approach in life that emphasizes kindness and compassion, and while this may lead to positive experiences, success often comes from taking risks and playing to win. People who are successful often do so by taking initiative and putting in the effort necessary to achieve their goals.
10730	I have been defending Obama for the past eight years, as he has taken a centrist approach to governing that has disappointed many progressives. Even though I expect Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic primary and become president, I am concerned that she may be even less progressive than Obama.
10731	I have become increasingly disillusioned with the political process in the United States over the last few years. While I am encouraged that Hillary Clinton is the likely Democratic presidential nominee, I am concerned that her policies will be less progressive than those of President Obama, especially in comparison to the alternatives available at the state level.
10732	I have been defending Barack Obama for six years in a very red state, as he kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed a Republican alternative to single payer, kept the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan going, and maintained the surveillance programs of the NSA. Now, Hillary Clinton is likely to win the primary and become president, and I am concerned that she will be even less progressive than Obama.
10733	I've been defending progressive policies for several years to my conservative friends in a red state, despite the fact that many of these policies were implemented by the Obama administration. While Hillary Clinton is likely to win the Democratic primary and become the next President, I am concerned that she will be less progressive than President Obama.
10734	I have become increasingly disillusioned with the state of progressive politics in the US. After eight years of the Obama administration, I am concerned that the next president, who is likely to be Hillary Clinton, may be even less progressive than the current one. This worries me as I believe that the next president will have a significant influence on the direction of the country.
10735	I've always been a fan of bulldogs, pugs, and other small-nosed breeds, as they can be incredibly cute. Unfortunately, due to their shorter muzzles, these dogs often have breathing issues and other health problems, which is a concern for owners. Surgery can be done to improve airflow, but it is optional and most owners do not choose to do it. It is heartbreaking to see these dogs struggle for air, and I would think carefully about ownership if I were aware of this.
10736	I have a great appreciation for bulldogs, pugs and other breeds of dogs, but due to designer breeding, these short-nosed dogs often have difficulty breathing and a variety of other health problems. Some of these issues are likely due to the challenge of breathing, which is likely a factor in many of these health issues. It is sad to see these amazing animals struggling, and I can understand the potential health problems I would face if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed, please let me know.
10737	It is sad to see these dogs struggling with their breathing, as these issues can often lead to health problems. From what I know, there is surgery available to increase airflow, but most owners choose not to opt for it. Bulldogs are wonderful animals, but it is heart-breaking to think of the difficulties they might have to face if one owns them.
10738	I love bulldogs, pugs and other breeds of dogs in general, however due to designer breeding, these short-nose dogs have difficulty breathing and a number of other health problems. Surgery can be done to increase air flow, but it is optional and many owners choose not to do it. It is heart-wrenching to see these animals struggle and I could imagine the health problems I would have if I owned them.
10739	I love bulldogs, pugs and other small-nosed breeds in particular, as they are adorable and appealing. Unfortunately, due to designer breeding, these dogs have poor air circulation and many health problems, which is probably a result of the struggle for each breath. Surgery can increase airflow, but most owners do not opt for it. It's heartbreaking to see them suffer from these health problems. If I am not mistaken, I would not want to take the risk of getting a bulldog if I knew these issues were likely to occur.
10740	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment can be uninspiring. After three years, I have realized that everyone is just passing through and the department statistics are what matter most, as well as the fact that no one notices their projects or has a true passion for their subjects. This has made me realize that universities are not as effective at serving humanity and only exist to fulfill corporate needs.
10741	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is not as inspiring as it could be. Three years down the line, you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by, and no one really notices what they are doing. For example, I chose to do a final year project that I was interested in; however, it seemed that everyone else just wanted it to finish, lacking passion for their creations. This has led me to the conclusion that universities are not as focused on nurturing creativity or passion for subjects, but instead seem to be more of a production line for the corporate world.
10742	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment can be uninspiring. I have come to realize that everyone is just passing by, even here, we are all trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in. It feels like no one notices or cares about what they are creating, which is discouraging. Universities may not always serve humanity in this way, but instead are primarily focused on providing a skillset for the corporate world.
10743	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment can be uninspiring. After three years, I have come to realize that everyone is just passing through, even though we are all trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in. Further, I have noticed that no one seems to show passion for their projects, making the experience feel forced. Thus, I have concluded that universities are not as effective in providing an education that serves humanity, but rather focuses on producing bodies of knowledge for the corporate world.
10744	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment can be uninspiring. Three years down the line, you come to realize that everyone is just passing by, even though we are all trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in. Although I enjoyed my final year project, it seemed that everyone else wanted it to finish, which showed no passion for what was created. This made me come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity, but instead are simply a production line for the corporate world.
10745	I believe the US was right to not intervene in these conflicts. Although we have the power to help, it is not our responsibility to solve these issues. I think the situation is more complex than that, as these types of genocides require the countries themselves to sort it out.
10746	I agree that the US should not be directly involved in situations like these. While it is important for the US to be aware of these situations, it is ultimately the responsibility of the countries where the genocide is occurring to sort out the conflict. America should be wary of becoming involved in other countries' issues.
10747	I believe that the US should prioritize human rights and take action to prevent genocide when possible. While it is ultimately the responsibility of the affected countries to resolve these conflicts, the US has a responsibility to intervene when possible, in order to stop atrocities and protect innocent lives.
10748	I believe that the US should not intervene in conflicts like these, as it can put the US in a difficult position. I believe that it is the responsibility of each country to sort out their own issues.  While the US is a superpower, it should not be viewed as the world's police, as this can lead to the US being seen as imperialist if it goes in to help.
10749	We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the holocaust. The piece believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this, put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are being overly-involved. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples' fights. I think that in all of these cases, it is their responsibility to sort it out themselves.
10750	In the UK, I have seen people complain that healthy food is too expensive, while in some supermarkets there are cheaper options for vegetables and other groceries. Here, you can purchase £1/1kg bags of carrots, £80p bags of celery, £1/1kg bags of oats, £75p/kg bags of bananas, etc., which is more affordable compared to other options. Moreover, it is possible to buy chicken breasts in bulk, which can last for several months in a freezer.
10751	In the UK, I have seen people complain about the cost of healthy food while shopping near me. However, healthy food is often much more affordable than people think; for example, I have seen £1/1kg bags of carrots, £1/1kg bags of oats, £80p bags of celery and £4/kg bags of bananas, all for less than £4. Additionally, it is possible to buy chicken breasts in bulk which will last months in the freezer for a much more affordable price.
10752	In the UK, I often hear people complain that healthy food is too expensive, yet many fruits and vegetables are relatively affordable when compared to other options. For example, a 1 kilogram bag of carrots costs approximately £1, a 1 kilogram bag of celery costs £1, and a 1 kilogram bag of oats costs around £1.50. Additionally, bananas are often less than £4 per kilogram. Thus, it is possible to purchase several kilograms of food for an affordable price when compared to other options.
10753	In the UK, there are many affordable options for healthy food. For example, one can find 1kg bags of carrots for £1, 1kg bags of oats for £1, 1kg bags of bananas for £75, and chicken breast in bulk for £48, all for less than £4. These options are more cost effective than buying ready meals at £2 each or worse, buying a £4-7 takeaway, which people seem to do often.
10754	This varies somewhat by country, but in the UK I often hear people complain that healthy food is too expensive, while grocery stores are filled with cheaper alternatives. For example, here in the UK, I have seen bags of carrots for £1 per kilo, bags of celery for £1 per kilo, and bags of oats for £1 per kilo - all of which would last several meals as a side dish. Additionally, I have seen chicken breasts available in bulk for £4.80 per 10 kilograms, which would last months. This shows that healthy food can be much more affordable than people realise.
10755	I believe sports can be a great form of entertainment and team building, however I think the resources used to sustain them could be better used to tackle genuine issues in our society. These resources could be focused on initiatives which could truly improve our world in a more lasting and effective way.
10756	I believe that sports can provide an important opportunity for individuals and teams to come together and take part in activities that provide both physical and mental health benefits. However, I think there are other ways to achieve this, which could free up more resources in our society that could be used for betterment of mankind.
10757	I think that sports have the potential to provide entertainment and camaraderie while also creating an environment which encourages physical activity and healthy competition, providing many benefits to individuals and the community as a whole. While these benefits can be achieved on a smaller scale, I believe that freeing up these resources could be beneficial for the betterment of society.
10758	I think sports have great value in providing entertainment and camaraderie, but these benefits could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up resources which could be used to benefit mankind more directly.
10759	I believe sports can be a great source of entertainment and team building, however, I think this could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind.
10760	Most people form their opinion on political issues not based on an unbiased assessment, but rather on an emotional reaction. This is especially true when two people with differing views discuss the issues, as each person will attempt to justify their opinion on what they consider to be rational grounds. While these discussions may end with both parties offering reasons why their arguments are more persuasive than the other's, the underlying reason for the person's opinion is not completely rational.
10761	Most people, most of the time, will form an opinion based on emotional rather than rational grounds; this is most evident when two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on what they perceive to be rational grounds, though ultimately there is a “meta” reason for the person’s opinion, which is not rational.
10762	Most people form their position on political issues more due to emotional reasons – a gut feeling – than based on a rational assessment of the arguments. This is most evident when two people with differing views discuss politics; each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds, but ultimately the decision comes down to personal preference. This suggests that there is some “meta” reason why people are more receptive to certain arguments, and this “meta” reason is not necessarily rational.
10763	Most people, most of the time, form their position on a given issue not solely based on rational grounds, but rather due to an emotional gut feeling. This is most apparent when people discuss politics, as each person justifies their opinion on seemingly rational grounds. However, the ultimate reason why someone is more open to certain arguments than others is often not entirely rational.
10764	Most people, most of the time, are more likely to form an opinion on an issue based on emotional rather than rational grounds. This is most evident when two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person may justify their viewpoint, but ultimately, each person's opinion is influenced by a variety of factors, with reasons being more subjective than rational.
10765	I discussed this with my parents, who are both very religious, and I realized that religion can be a factor in instigating conflicts, as it limits the spread of progress in sciences such as medicine, climate change and evolution, as well as societal issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, abortion and contraception.
10766	I had a conversation with my parents, who are both very religious, and I realized that religion can be a cause of conflict. This is primarily due to its ability to restrict scientific progress, particularly in the fields of medicine, climate change, and biology, as well as societal advances such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
10767	I was talking with my parents, who are both very religious, and I realized that while religion can contribute to wars, its biggest limitation is that it hinders the progress of science, specifically in the areas of climate change and evolution, as well as social issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
10768	I spoke with my parents, who are both highly religious, and I realized that religion can be a cause of conflict as it restricts the progress of science, particularly in the fields of medicine, climate change and evolution, as well as social issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion and contraception.
10769	I discussed this with my parents, who are both very religious, and I realized that while religion can contribute to conflict, it also hinders progress in science, especially when it comes to climate change and evolution. Additionally, it affects society, especially with regards to same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
10770	Capitalism provides incentives for hard work and ingenuity, as income can be increased through effort and ability. This can help lift up those who have a less comfortable life, allowing them to eventually have a more comfortable life. This helps ensure that everyone has a relatively equal life, which can be beneficial for the society as a whole. However, this may be limited by taxation on the rich if necessary.
10771	Capitalism provides more opportunities for hard work to be rewarded as well as providing incentives for people to invest and take risks, which can help raise the living standards of people. In socialism, everyone has an equal income, and this can provide more opportunities for people to develop their skills and talents and also allows people to access public resources, as well as being taxed to help the poor. This can benefit people's lives in a more equal way.
10772	In socialism, everyone has an equal life where taxation helps to uplift the poor and capitalism helps to keep incomes closer to the mean. Socialism also provides more government assistance and safety nets for those in need, which helps to reduce poverty and inequality. In addition, socialism provides more freedoms and opportunities for all individuals to make their own choices. In this way, everyone can have a relatively equal life.
10773	I believe that socialism can be beneficial in terms of providing equality of income and enabling people to have relatively better lives compared to capitalism. In socialism, taxation on the rich can ensure that the poor are uplifted, whereas in capitalism the government cannot interfere with individual spending. Socialism can also ensure that everyone has an equal life.
10774	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hardworking have a comfortable life and the non-hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed.  According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life. Socialism can ensure that everyone has access to the same resources, allowing everyone to thrive, providing more equal opportunities and raising the overall quality of life. This can lead to a more equitable society with more equal opportunities for all.
10775	I understand your concern about the bait fish being caught and the suffering they experienced. However, as a fisher, I believe that fishing is a way of harvesting fish in a humane way. In order to catch the fish, the bait fish are used as an attractant to draw in larger fish. This method is proven to be effective and reduces the stress and suffering of the fish.
10776	I agree that the process of catching and releasing fish can be distressing for the animals, and I understand why this practice may seem inhumane. However, while it is unsustainable fishing that should be avoided, fishing can be an effective way of catching food and providing food security in some cases. It is important to minimize the amount of suffering that the fish experience, and in some cases this can be done through careful handling and releasing.
10777	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish – live fish we caught the night before, then later pierced a large hook through their still-live bodies and tossed them in the water.   I can understand why this might seem disturbing to some people; however, I believe it is an acceptable form of fishing as it enables us to catch and release the fish in a more humane way. Furthermore, the fish often swim away unharmed as there is a chance that they were able to escape the hook.
10778	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.  In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish, which we caught the night before. We then attached a large hook to these bait fish and tossed them into the water. This enabled us to later target and catch larger fish that were interested in the bait fish. We released the bait fish once they were caught.   I still believe that this method is more humane than other forms of fishing, as the bait fish were still alive when we caught them and were only injured when we released them. I understand that the hooked bait fish may have suffered during this process, but I still believe that this method is more humane than other forms of fishing.
10779	I went deep sea fishing last weekend on the invitation of a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released some ten to fifteen fish. To catch these fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish - alive fish which we caught the night before, then later inserted a large hook through their still-live bodies and tossed them in the water.   I acknowledge that this practice can be distressing for the bait fish, and I understand the ethical concerns this raises. However, I believe that the suffering of the bait fish was minimized, as the hook provided them with a better chance of survival, as well as an quicker death than being eaten by larger fish. Moreover, I have no doubt that the fish were eventually released back into the water.
10780	In my opinion, the Tories are likely to continue pursuing policies that serve to benefit the wealthy and increase educational fees while restricting access to education, as seen under Gove's reign. While the new Minister may be slightly more supportive of LGBT+ rights and gender equality, it is unlikely that meaningful change will occur.
10781	In my opinion, the Conservative Party tends to favor policies that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, leading to a worsening situation for education and other public services. This new Education Secretary voted against gay marriage, and I fear that outcomes for education may be similar to those under Gove's reign.
10782	In my opinion, the Conservative Party is focused primarily on serving the interests of wealthy individuals and corporations at the expense of everyday people, as demonstrated by the policies implemented by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, such as cutting school funding and raising tuition fees. This runs counter to the stated goals of the party, which prioritize access to education and equality for all.
10783	I believe the Conservative Party is mostly made up of selfish individuals who prioritize their own wealth over that of the wider population. This new Secretary of State has also voted against gay marriage, and is in favour of policies such as academies and tuition fee hikes, which will likely have a disproportionate effect on those from less affluent backgrounds.
10784	In my opinion, the Conservative government has implemented policies that largely benefit the wealthy while restricting access to education and healthcare for those who can least afford it. While I am concerned that these policies may worsen under the new Secretary of State, I believe that there will be some changes.
10785	I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. While these rights are important for a healthy functioning of society and protection of its citizens, these rights can be removed in some way, and are not necessarily intrinsically given to a human at birth.
10786	I believe natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, do not exist. Rights are socially constructed and are not necessarily given to individuals at birth. While these rights may be guaranteed in a legal structure, they are not necessarily innate.
10787	I believe that natural rights, which are universal and inalienable, can exist outside of societal constructs and government regulations. These rights, such as the right to freedom of speech and the right to education, are intrinsically given to humans at birth, but can be taken away in certain contexts.
10788	I believe natural rights, which are fundamental and universal, exist independently of legal or cultural structures and are inalienable. Natural rights provide individuals access to necessary resources and are protected under the law. These rights are able to be removed in some cases, but they are still inherent to humans at birth.
10789	I believe natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, do not exist in an absolute sense. These rights are socially constructed and provided by society to ensure access to commodities or a certain state of being. As such, these rights are not necessarily innate or universally given to humans at birth, but can be removed by certain governments or groups.
10790	I've always looked at recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. Many times this can result in a video that is cropped or stretched, which can look unsightly when watched later on YouTube or Facebook. This is especially true if the viewer is watching it on a different device than the original one.
10791	I understand the importance of framing videos to make them more watchable on various platforms; however, I personally feel that people should take into consideration how the video will look when watched later, as this is something that viewers often need to consider. Although there may be instances where the person recording the video intends to only view it on the same device, it is still best to ensure that the video is aesthetically pleasing to view.  I believe that this is a matter of personal preference, as the user may still wish to adjust the video's aspect ratio accordingly in order to make it more viewable.
10792	I think it is important to take into consideration how the video will look later when watched later on YouTube/Facebook/etc. It can be frustrating when videos are captured in a way that covers only part of the screen or is stretched and blurred, as this can make the video itself look worse. This is especially true if the viewer plans to watch it on a different device, as the video is intended for.
10793	I understand that recording a video vertically can sometimes result in a poor viewing experience, as the video may be stretched or cropped to fit a larger screen. This can be frustrating, as the video may not show the full scene or correctly capture the intended scene. However, I believe that people should take into consideration how the video will look when watched later on YouTube, etc.
10794	I've always looked at recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. While this provides an immersive experience for the viewer, it can often lead to black bars being introduced on the video, which can make the video look uneven or stretched. This can happen if the video is watched on a different device, since the original video may have been intended to be viewed on the same device only.
10795	It was after I did some research and talked to friends and family that I personally learned how big this vaccinations and anti vaccinations topic is.  In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated.  Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives and some people do and the same thing happens.  I would assume this is because of our biology.  While vaccines can reduce the severity and duration of illnesses, it is still possible for people to get sick regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated.  Thus, it is up to the parents to decide what is best for their children.  This is their decision to make.
10796	It was after I did some research and spoke with friends and family that I became more aware of the debates around vaccinations. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not children are vaccinated. Some people choose not to vaccinate and live healthy lives, while some people do and the same happens. I believe this is due to our biology. Yes, vaccinated children get sick and those who are not vaccinated get sick.   My conclusion is that parents should be able to make an informed decision and should be satisfied with that choice.
10797	It was after I did some research and talked to friends and family that I personally learned how big this vaccinations and anti vaccinations topic is.  In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated.  Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives and some people do and the same thing happens.  I would assume this is because of our biology.  Of course vaccinated people get sick and people who aren't vaccinated get sick.  I believe the decision should be left up to the parents as they should be aware of the pros and cons of their decision and should be satisfied with that.
10798	It was after I did some research and spoke to friends and family that I personally learned how big this vaccination debate is.  In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not children get vaccinated.  Some people choose not to vaccinate and still live long, healthy lives and some people do and the same occurs.  I believe this is due to our biology.  Yes, vaccinated people still get sick and people who aren't vaccinated also get sick.  I believe that people should have the right to make their own decision and should be informed of the pros and cons of their choice.  People should be satisfied with that decision.
10799	It was after I did some research and spoke to friends and family that I personally learned how contentious the vaccinations versus anti-vaccinations issue can be. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not children are vaccinated. Some people choose not to and live long, healthy lives, while others choose to and this can happen. I believe this is due to our biology. Yes, vaccinated people can get sick and people who are not vaccinated can get sick.  I believe that parents should be given information about the pros and cons of their decision and feel comfortable with it.
10800	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and found that the brain is an integral part of consciousness, though it is possible that consciousness has an external or internal source. We cannot be sure if consciousness is sourced in the brain or not, and this remains a philosophical question. It is also possible that consciousness could continue after death, but this is a matter of personal belief.
10801	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. It is possible that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon from the complexity of the brain, but we do not currently have evidence of this. This leads us to question whether consciousness is an external or internal phenomenon. We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.
10802	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This suggests that consciousness may be externally sourced, as we cannot definitively say that it is an internal or external source. We may simply be a host for consciousness, which could have an external source. It is also possible that consciousness is an result of a random accidental chemical reaction, rather than an internal process of the brain. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that consciousness is sourced in the brain.
10803	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a ‘center of consciousness’ in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This raises the question of whether our consciousness could have an external or internal source. While our current understanding of the brain is that it is integral to our consciousness, this does not necessarily mean that it is the source of our consciousness, as it could be an external source instead. Similarly, we could just as easily be a host for consciousness, or it could have an external source. We have no scientific basis for believing either way at this point.
10804	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. While our consciousness is closely intertwined with the activities of the brain, it is possible that consciousness has an external source or is generated in a different way. The exact nature of consciousness remains an open question.
10805	In light of recent events at the World Cup in Brazil, I am reminded of why I have mixed feelings about Soccer (Football). While I acknowledge its dramatic elements, there have been cases of corruption in other team sports as well, with Soccer (Football)'s being on an entirely different level. Officials have often failed to enforce the rules and regulations, and FIFA has often taken money from the host nation without any repercussions. Racism has been an issue throughout the sport's history, and the lack of enforcement of certain rules has been troubling.
10806	In light of the recent events at the World Cup in Brazil, it is clear that there are serious issues with the organization and governance of football that need to be addressed. While football has its own unique features, it is also true that other sports, including football, suffer from similar issues such as corruption. This shows that football needs stronger governance and better enforcement of regulations in order to ensure a fair and equitable environment for all teams.
10807	In light of the scandal that recently occurred in the first round of the World Cup, between Brazil and Croatia, I am reminded of why I am not a fan of Soccer (Football). While I acknowledge that the sport has its dramatic moments, there are numerous cases of corruption in other sports that are just as concerning. These issues range from match-fixing to officials taking bribes, all of which make Soccer (Football) one of the most corrupt sports. Moreover, FIFA's overtaking of host nations and reluctance to implement technology add to the already volatile issues facing the sport.
10808	In light of the recent match-fixing allegations surrounding the FIFA World Cup, I am reminded of why I am cautious of Soccer (Football). Though I recognize its ability to create dramatic moments, the sport has been marred by corruption issues that are much more severe than those found in other team sports.
10809	In light of the controversy that recently occurred in the first round of the World Cup, between Brazil and Croatia, I am reminded of why I have a negative opinion of soccer (football). Although I recognize its dramatic qualities, corruption in soccer is on an entirely different level, with numerous cases of match-fixing, officials taking bribes, FIFA's pilfering of host nations, and rampant racism being some of the evidences that make it difficult to enjoy the game.
10810	Let’s say that he chose to evacuate the Jews to Madagascar, or to set up camps and other measures to try to prevent the spread of the virus. While these measures may have cost lives, they would have prevented the scale of deaths that occurred. He was aware that his actions could cause unrest in certain areas, so he sought to limit the impact of his decisions by limiting the number of people affected. He understood the need to act quickly and take decisive measures. Although his actions were unpopular in some areas, he believed that it was necessary to ensure the future of his country.
10811	He was determined to restore Germany to its rightful place among the nations and to make up for the losses and limitations imposed on it following World War I. He planned the Autobahn, a major feat of engineering, which served as a symbol of Germany's revival. If it were not for the Holocaust, Germans may have been more proud of their history.
10812	Let's say that he continued with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar, or implemented alternative plans to provide them with safe havens. He achieved more in less time than Napoleon or Roman Empire, which caused great powers like Russia, France, and the UK to nearly or completely lose their foothold. Germany rose again from the ashes, similar to a phoenix, with revenge for Versailles. He also constructed the Autobahn, which is a masterpiece of modern architecture. I believe that if it were not for the genocide, Germans would be more proud of their history.
10813	Let's say that he chose to relocate the Jews to Madagascar, or alternatively, to implement policies which were more lenient than those enacted by other countries. This allowed Germany to rise quickly from the ashes of the Great Depression, something that previous generations had wished to achieve during World War I. He also planned the Autobahn, a modern architectural marvel which greatly benefitted the German people. I believe that if it were not for the Holocaust, Germans would be even prouder of their history.
10814	Let's say that he continued with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or did something else to provide them with better living conditions. He conquered more land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires such as Russia, France and UK almost to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide, Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.
10815	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. You think wow that's nice how happy they are. But think about it. Especially in the case of a graduation, the child has to then go days or weeks with the disappointing thought that mom or dad isn't going to be there. That's sucks. If it were me, I'd rather be saved that heartache in the first place rather than get surprised. I'd want to know immediately that my mom or dad was coming home early. Making me feel sad about it longer than necessary, and lying to me is a dick move.   I think the surprise factor is nice for those moments, but it's ultimately more important to me to know as soon as possible that my parent is coming home, and in the case of graduation, that would be even more devastating to have to cope with the thought that mom or dad isn't coming home.
10816	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. You think wow that's nice how happy they are. However, in some cases, the student may have to deal with the emotional stress of not knowing if their parent/guardian will be there, which can be distressing. If it were me, I'd rather be informed immediately that my parent/guardian was coming home early. Making me feel sad about it longer than necessary is a bit unfair.
10817	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. You think it is a nice gesture, however, it can be upsetting for the child if they do not know immediately that their mother or father is coming home. It can be traumatic to experience this surprise and have the thought of not having their parents present for a longer period of time. Graduation is an important milestone, so it is preferable to be prepared from the start.
10818	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. While this can be a special moment for the family, it can be difficult for the child if they have to wait for some time for their parent to come home. It would be preferable to know immediately that their parent is coming home. Making the child feel sad for longer than necessary is a difficult experience.
10819	You see the videos of people getting surprised at their graduation or at school/work by a military member coming home. You think wow that's nice how happy they are. But think about it. Especially in the case of a graduation, the child has to then go days or weeks with the disappointing thought that mom or dad isn't going to be there. That's sucks. If it were me, I'd rather be saved that heartache in the first place rather than get surprised. I'd want to know immediately that my mom or dad was coming home early.  In some cases, it may be beneficial to inform the student earlier on, especially if the graduation is particularly important, as this could provide some comfort and optimism in an otherwise difficult situation.
10820	I believe that rights have a basis beyond constructs, but that these rights are specific to the culture and context of a particular society or group. Rights, such as the right to freedom of speech, can be seen as universal and inalienable, as these are rights that protect individuals from undue state interference. While these rights may not apply universally, I believe that they are rights that humanity as a whole should have access to. Rights are not simply constructs, but rather rights that are grounded in an underlying moral code and framework of a particular society.
10821	I believe that natural rights are based on the idea that all humans have certain rights and freedoms that should be respected by society and the state, and that these rights are universal and inalienable. I believe that these rights have been established through societal and cultural norms and are enforceable through law, but that these rights are not necessarily part of fundamental human nature.  There is the potential for these rights to be extended beyond the in-group, but this is primarily due to the extension of law.  There is nothing inherent in the nature of reality that establishes rights.
10822	I agree that rights are largely constructed, but I believe there are certain rights which are universal and inalienable, such as the right to life and liberty. It is true that these rights only apply to certain groups and cultures, but it is possible to expand these rights to cover everyone, as law does in general. Rights are indeed constructs, but they can be extended beyond what is natural in human nature, as law has done for larger groups.
10823	I would argue that rights are constructs which have been established by society in order to provide a sense of stability and protection to individuals. It is true that these rights only generally apply to certain groups, but this does not mean that these rights are not universal or inalienable to all members of society. Rights are a social construct which are necessary to provide security and order in order to ensure justice and stability in a society.
10824	I believe that rights are constructs which reflect the needs of society and serve as a foundation for legal and social frameworks. These rights provide individuals with security, autonomy, and access to justice and are often based on the concept of equality or proportionality. Although these rights may be enforced by law, they are primarily social constructs which serve to protect the rights of individuals. While there is some appeal to universal behaviour, these rights mainly apply to the in-group, as rights are extensions of tribal self-rule to cover larger groups. These rights are not necessarily innate to all humans and may vary based on culture and location. Natural rights may be universal, but they are still constructs which rely on humanity’s own social and legal frameworks.
10825	I believe that the US has much to offer in terms of culture, economy and innovation which makes it one of the greatest countries in the world. Despite its problems, the US is an economic, educational and cultural leader. For example, the US has the highest GDP, contributes the most to global aid and is the entertainment capital of the world. This makes the US stand out from other countries in terms of overall quality.
10826	The US has a number of advantages that make it one of the world's leading economies and countries. It has the largest GDP, the highest level of charitable donations and is the entertainment capital of the world. This makes the US an attractive destination for business, tourism and education. The US also has its own set of issues, but it is still a leader in many regards. Ultimately, the best country can depend on the individual's interpretation.
10827	The US has a powerful economy and is a leader in providing aid and assistance to other countries, making it a great contributor to global growth. It is also a leader in providing access to quality education and entertainment. These factors, in addition to its strong universities, have allowed the US to become the superpower it is today. While the US does have its own set of problems, its strength as a nation is undeniable.
10828	I realise that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So I don't really have a definition for greatest and so I guess it's open for interpretation.  The US has many strengths that contribute to its overall strength as a nation. Its economic and military power set it apart from other countries, giving it an edge in terms of influence and global reach. In addition, the US is home to many top-tier universities, production studios and groundbreaking medical and technological advances. In some areas, the US has the edge over other countries, making it a leader in terms of performance.
10829	I understand that the US has a larger GDP than China, and that the US is the leading country in terms of charity donations and quality of higher education. However, other countries such as the UK and China have also seen improvements in these aspects, suggesting that there is competition between these countries. I believe that the US is still one of the top countries in the world, but other countries may be deemed the best depending on the criteria.
10830	Frank Sinatra was generally considered to have the better voice of the two, with more range and a better timbre. His early influences were more blues and jazz-based, while Dino’s were mainlyopera and classical music. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing better than Martin. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians.
10831	Neither one of these two Italian crooners were particularly gifted singers in my opinion. Dino had the better voice, more range and better tone, as well as being influenced by earlier jazz and blues artists. Francis had better phrasing and was able to use space and timing better than Martin. Jazz fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board had some jazz sensibilities, as well as his songs being recorded extensively by jazz musicians.
10832	Neither one of these two Italian crooners was particularly gifted singers in my opinion, with Dino having the better voice, more range and better tone. Dino was influenced by early blues and jazz music, while Francis had better phrasing and a greater understanding of space and timing in his songs. Jazz fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, with the latter having less popularity among jazz audiences.
10833	Neither one of these two Italian crooners were particularly gifted singers in my opinion. Dino had a better voice, more range and better tone, influenced by earlier jazz and blues-based songs. Francis had better phrasing and a knack for using space and timing better than Martin. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on, when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin.
10834	Dino had the better voice, with more range and better tone; his early influences were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing better than Martin. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians, though fewer of Dino's songs have.
10835	1. I'm amazed that the Administration has not yet permanently placed duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of this President's mouth astonish me. Between an apparent lack of understanding of how bad the situation was (as reported in the article) and a Congress that did not even read the entire bill, as well as poor economic philosophy from the start, the package is a terrible idea.  2. The bill contains a lot of pork, which is never a good idea. The economic philosophy of the Administration seems flawed. It is worrisome that they did not take the time to fully understand the situation.
10836	1. I'm amazed that the administration has not permanently inserted duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of this guy's mouth have been a constant source of concern since the bill was passed. Between an apparent lack of understanding of the situation and a bill that has so much pork, it could be Porky the Pig reincarnated, this package has been a poor idea from the get-go.  2. Between an apparent lack of congressional oversight, an administration that did not even read the entire bill, and an economic philosophy that is questionable at best, the package was a poor idea from the get-go.
10837	1. I'm amazed that the administration has not yet permanently put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The things that come out of it are often ill-informed and misguided.   2. Between an apparent lack of understanding of the bill's long-term impacts, a Congress that failed to thoroughly examine the legislation, poor economic policy from the start, and a bill ridden with pork, the package is a terrible idea.  It could have been better crafted to provide greater assistance to those in need.
10838	1. I'm amazed that the administration has not yet permanently restricted access to the Affordable Care Act. The healthcare law has been difficult to implement, with some states receiving more funding than others and the legislation being amended several times since its enactment.  2. Between an apparent lack of understanding of the true state of the economy and healthcare system, and a bill containing significant pork, the law is a risk. While it has the potential to improve healthcare in the long run, the potential drawbacks are too great at this point.
10839	1. I'm amazed that the havn't permanently blocked Biden's microphone. The stupid things that come out of this guy's mouth... have been increasingly difficult to contain with presidential executive orders. Between an apparent lack of understanding of how bad things really were (read the article), a Congress that didn't even read the entire bill, poor economic philosophy from the get-go, and a bill that has so much Pork in it, it could be Porky the Pig reincarnated into a piece of legislation. This package has been a terrible idea.  2. All in all, the Obama administration's economic policies have been a largely disappointing venture thus far.
10840	We didn't impeach GW, even though he sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and damaged our reputation globally. Clinton's offense was consensual sex, which is not as serious as those issues. It is arguable that Clinton's actions were worse than what other presidents did, which could be considered reasonable grounds for impeachment.
10841	We didn't impeach George W. Bush, who ran up trillions of dollars in debt and started wars that have cost thousands of lives and damaged our reputation worldwide. Clinton's actions were no worse than what other great presidents have done; he got a blowjob in the Oval Office, which is no different than what other leaders have done.
10842	We did not impeach George W. Bush despite the fact that his actions sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and damaged our international standing. Clinton's actions were essentially the same as what other presidents have done; however, we chose to impeach Clinton. That decision seems puzzling to us.
10843	We didn't impeach GW although he sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trashed our name throughout the world. Clinton's offense was far less serious than that, yet we impeached him. I think it is a question of whether the political parties of the time thought it would be beneficial for their candidates. All presidents have the power to potentially impact the economy and foreign policy, so it is understandable that Congress may act to try to limit such power when they view it as an impeachable offense.
10844	We did not impeach George W. Bush, who oversaw trillions of dollars in debt, multiple wars that have cost thousands of lives, and severe reputational damage to the US. Clinton's actions, while in office, were not worse than what other great presidents have done; his actions were personal matters between him and his wife that should have remained private.  In contrast, Cheney shooting his friend in the head did not result in any penalty, as he did not apologize for the incident. This highlights the need for greater accountability for the president in such matters.
10845	We are all individuals and while some may not agree with same-sex relationships, it is a matter of personal choice and should not be a cause for concern. Everyone has the right to be happy and should not have to compromise their identity simply to appease others.
10846	We are all individuals, and while some people may not agree with same-sex relationships, it is a matter of personal freedom and expression. I believe that everyone has the right to be happy and live their life as they choose, without having to compromise their identity or beliefs.
10847	We are all humans at the end of the day, and if some people do not accept same-sex relationships, that is their opinion. I believe that everyone has the right to be happy and live according to their identity; it should not be a challenge to someone's identity. I believe that God would want us to be content and following our true identity, even if it differs from societal norms.
10848	We are all individuals, and while some may not agree with same-sex relationships, it is a matter of personal choice. As long as couples are happy and able to express themselves, this should be respected and supported.
10849	We are all humans at the end of the day, and if some people do not agree with same-sex relationships, that is their opinion. I believe that people have the right to be happy and should not have to live a lie just to satisfy other people’s beliefs. Everyone should be able to pursue their own happiness, as it is important to feel fulfilled in life.
10850	Macs have a similar lifespan to PCs, as PCs can experience hardware failure or require replacement at a similar rate. I have personally experienced this in environments where Macs are used as the primary computers, indicating that the two platforms are similar in terms of reliability.
10851	Macs have the same hardware specifications as other computers, allowing them to have comparable longevity and reliability. In my experience, this is true whether the computers are networked together or used individually.
10852	PCs can be less expensive than Macs in terms of hardware, as Macs use generic hardware that is not specific to Apple. However, this can depend on the individual machine and usage environment; Macs can have similar breakdown rates as PCs in some cases.
10853	PCs may be cheaper in terms of hardware costs, but Apple computers typically have more powerful hardware and are more reliable than PCs in the long run. While this is often believed, Apple machines need to be replaced or fixed less often than PCs in a network environment.
10854	PCs have the potential to be cheaper in terms of hardware cost, but Apple hardware is more powerful than generic PC hardware, which some people believe is the case with PCs. It is true that Macs can experience the same problems as PCs, especially when used in a networked environment. However, this has been our experience with both Pro machines.
10855	In the Lion King, a death of a good character gives the movie a more serious and dramatic tone, which makes it more layered and thus more appropriate for a wider range of people. This increased appeal makes the movie more profitable in terms of revenue. Moreover, the Lion King earned more Oscar nominations than Aladdin, thus making it a better choice.
10856	In the Lion King, a significant character death provides more emotional depth to the movie, thus making it more accessible for a wider range of viewers. This increases the potential revenue for the movie. Additionally, Lion King received more Oscar nominations than Aladdin, which further enhances its success.
10857	In the Lion King, a more serious and dramatic event occurs, which makes the movie more layered and thus more suitable for a wider range of audience. This increase in potential revenue is further strengthened by the movie's higher number of Oscar nominations.

10859	In The Lion King, the death of a good character provides a more serious and dramatic undertone to the movie, making it more layered and appealing to a wider range of people. This provides a larger potential audience and revenue for the movie. Moreover, The Lion King received more Oscar nominations than Aladdin.
10860	It is possible to discuss religious matters respectfully, but such debates often do more harm than good. People tend to become entrenched in their own beliefs, with each side feeling that their beliefs are under attack and neither side having the chance to change their beliefs. Such debates also often focus too much on quotations and evidence rather than exploring the deeper aspects of the topics at hand.
10861	Yes, religious debates can be a fruitless exercise. Depending on the views of each party, one or both may feel unfairly attacked and little is likely to change in terms of beliefs. Debates of this nature often focus on an individual's beliefs, with neither side able to persuade the other due to limited evidence or proof.
10862	Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. Instead of insults being passed and one side or the other being belittled, each side's beliefs are questioned without any proof or explanation, which prevents either side from gaining an understanding of the other. This simply leads to a stalemate, as neither side is able to persuade the other.
10863	Yes, it is possible to have a civil debate about religion. However, this type of debate does not accomplish much as one side or the other is often ridiculed and not many convictions are likely to change. Both sides have their drawbacks and it is difficult to explain the full picture of each faith due to limited knowledge.
10864	Yes, a religious debate can be counterproductive, as it does little to change beliefs and tends to lead to an atmosphere of conflict rather than understanding. Both sides have strengths and weaknesses, and it can be difficult to evaluate certain aspects of either faith due to a lack of evidence.
10865	California is an excellent state with a lot of opportunities. It is home to a diverse economy, with the tenth-largest economy in the world (as estimated by CIA) and offers some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. Additionally, it has good weather and is free from some of the kinds of hate/racism that are present in other states.

10870	When spelling out words over the phone with the letter Z, it can be difficult to convey the sound to those who are accustomed to the American alphabet, as Z tends to be pronounced as a 'Zee' sound in some regions, whereas it is pronounced as a 'Zed' sound in other regions. To ensure clarity, it may be beneficial to modify the alphabet song to accommodate both variations.
10871	In some regions, the letter Z is pronounced as 'ZED', whereas in other areas it may be pronounced as 'ZEE'. This can cause confusion when speaking over the phone, as the pronunciation of certain letters may differ depending on the region. To ensure that both parties are able to understand each other, it might be beneficial to adjust the alphabet song to better accommodate different pronunciations.
10872	When speaking to someone over the phone and needing to spell something with the letter Z, it can be unclear which sound people in the West are used to hearing; however, if the sound of Z is changed to ZEE in the West, this can cause confusion. To accommodate both regions, it could be beneficial to adjust the alphabet song to make it more accessible for everyone.
10873	It can be difficult to spell words with the letter Z when speaking over the phone, as some dialects of English assign the letter Z a distinct pronunciation that can be confusing to other dialects. However, by adjusting the alphabet song, we can make it easier for people of different dialects to communicate.
10874	It can be challenging to spell words with the letter 'Z' when speaking with someone from a different region, as some countries, such as America, use the letter 'Z' for the sound 'ZED', while other countries, such as the UK, use the letter 'Z' for the sound 'ZEE'. To make it easier for people to communicate, it might be beneficial to adapt the alphabet song to accommodate both sounds.
10875	It is important to assess intelligence before drawing conclusions, as is done with the U.S.-Israel relationship. Israel's reliance on terror and violence has been countered by robust diplomatic efforts by both countries, with U.S. support. Although the U.S. government is likely to give Israel diplomatic cover if it decides to preemptively attack Iran, that does not mean the U.S. government would automatically support such an action.
10876	The situation regarding Iran is similar to that of the lead up to the Iraq War. There are those in government who are making accusations and attempting to build intelligence around them. Intelligence should be assessed first and conclusions drawn from that, rather than relying on accusations. Israel has become a state that relies on terror and violence, rather than balancing strength with diplomacy. Both Israel and the US have a dysfunctional relationship that is heavily reliant on the US government.
10877	It is important to assess intelligence first and draw conclusions based on that, rather than making accusations and then trying to bolster them up with intelligence. Israel and the US have a relatively unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship, as Israel relies more on terror and violence than balancing it with diplomacy. The US has provided Israel with unconditional support in the past, even when it comes to preemptive attacks on Iran, which could be dangerous.
10878	Israel and the U.S. have a strong partnership based on a shared desire for security and stability in the region. Israel is a key ally of the US, and we have a mutual recognition that strength should be based on diplomacy rather than relying exclusively on military force.
10879	Israel and the U.S. have a complex relationship. Israel relies on its military strength and has used it to address opposition while America has, in the past, provided diplomatic support. This indicates a lack of balance between strength and diplomacy, which can have unintended consequences. While Israel's actions may have the backing of the U.S. government, this should serve as a warning against making accusations and relying on intelligence alone.
10880	Young people generally tend to follow what is popular on the radio and MTV, which right now includes the rap music with its constant references to money and cars. While these songs may come together with some dance moves, they have become popular with the audience due to their catchy tunes.

10884	Today's popular music has changed significantly over the years, and the trend seems to be shifting towards a more urban sound. This includes songs with a heavy beat and rhymes, as well as themes of money, cars and gangsta culture. This type of music is incredibly popular among younger listeners, and it seems to be the current trend.
10885	Yes, it is important to consider the potential loss of contributions that person could make to society. As people are able to change their minds, it is possible that interventions and greater investment of resources could help prevent suicide. Suicide prevention should be a priority as it is a tragedy that can be prevented.
10886	Suicide is a difficult issue and can have a significant impact on both individuals and society as a whole. While it is difficult to predict how an individual might feel in the future, it is possible to provide more support and resources to aid in preventing suicide.
10887	I believe that it is important to consider the potential contributions that an individual could make to society, as well as the impact that suicide can have on family, friends, and communities. Moreover, it is important to focus on prevention efforts, as suicide is indeed a tragedy that can be prevented.
10888	Yes, suicide is a major loss to society as it deprives us of potential contributions from that individual. We should make more efforts to prevent suicide, as it is possible to do so. Suicide prevention should be given more consideration and resources, as death is a tragedy that can be prevented.
10889	Yes, suicide can be a tragedy and can have a significant impact on a country in terms of education and potential contributions to society. We should strive to provide more resources and support to help people who are considering taking their own life. While it is difficult to predict if someone will ultimately choose to end their life, more resources and efforts should be invested in suicide prevention.
10890	We often see different colours in our everyday lives, with shades of other colours being the norm. For example, in the Rebecca Black Friday music video, a new shade of purple appears on the screen which I had not seen before. This indicates that our brains can still interpret new colours which does not cause an automatic emotional or mental reaction.
10891	We often see different colors in our daily lives. These colors are often shades of other colors, such as the purple color in the Rebecca Black Friday music video. I had never seen this particular shade of purple before in my life, although it was different from what I was accustomed to seeing.
10892	We often see different shades of colours, such as in the Rebecca Black Friday music video. When she is singing about how it's Friday, a unique shade of purple appears on the screen which I had never seen before. It caught my attention as it was a new hue I had not seen before.

10900	I believe that having the motto on our currency serves as a reminder of our nation’s history and values. It is important to recognize our nation’s heritage and to maintain our connection to our past, even as we look to the future. The motto also serves as a reminder that our government recognizes a higher power, which is important for many Americans.
10901	I believe that having the motto on our money is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our nation's history and values, which are important for us to maintain as a country. It can also be an inspiration for people to remain connected to their beliefs, even if they do not worship regularly. From an economic standpoint, it could give people a sense of optimism and hope that can help stimulate the economy.
10902	You seem to argue that it is beneficial to keep the motto on the money. I agree that it does not pose an issue from an economic standpoint and could help provide a sense of national identity to citizens. I believe that it is still up to the individual on whether or not they agree with the motto on the money.
10903	You seem to indicate that the presence of the motto on the money has no economic benefit. I believe that the presence of the motto could inspire people to have a sense of pride and confidence in the economy, which could potentially lead to economic growth.
10904	I understand the motto is important to some people and can serve as a reminder of our nation's history and values, but I don't think it is essential to make changes to the currency.
10905	Given that the strategy is created by management, AGENTS need to be able to feel comfortable with the plan, as management needs to be able to adjust it if needed. Therefore, if AGENTS are not comfortable with it, management should come up with an alternative plan to ensure the strategy is successful.
10906	Managers create the strategy to maximize efficiency and improve the customer experience, but if the agents do not agree with it, then management must be more proactive in creating a better plan that works better for everyone. Agents should be able to give feedback to ensure that the strategies are beneficial for everyone in the long run.
10907	AGENTS. This is callcenter operations; it should already be a given that management creates the strategy to ensure that the AGENTS are able to perform optimally. If the strategy is not favorable to the AGENTS, management should be willing to adjust it to ensure greater efficiency. Otherwise, there needs to be some flexibility for the plan to be able to work.
10908	Management needs to create a strategy that works for both agents and customers, as agents are the ones interacting directly with customers. If management's plan is not favourable to agents, then they need to come up with a new one that is more suitable. Agents need to be able to give feedback and provide suggestions to management, as this can help create a better system.
10909	AGENTS are the ones on the ground, interacting with customers and creating outcomes. Management creates the strategy, but if it is not advantageous for AGENTS, then Management needs to come up with an alternative plan. Management should be able to adjust the strategy if needed to improve the experience for AGENTS.
10910	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, it is important to have proof to validate these claims. Refusal to offer this proof can hinder a person's ability to encounter the truth. While it is understandable that there may be no proof available, it is important to make sure that these beliefs are communicated as beliefs, rather than as truth.
10911	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, you need evidence to validate your claim. If people are unable to experience or understand this truth, it is their right to choose what they believe; however, it is the responsibility of the believer to share their truth and enable others to discover it.
10912	If you hold religious beliefs, it is important to have evidence to back up these claims, as this allows people to encounter the truth. While it may be possible to have faith without proof, this could potentially hinder people’s ability to explore the truth. If religious beliefs are promoted as truth, it is important to be able to provide proof to substantiate these beliefs.
10913	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, it is essential to have evidence to back up these claims. Denying people access to this evidence can prevent them from discovering the truth, which could result in them being condemned for eternity. While it is acceptable to hold beliefs without proof, it is important to ensure these beliefs are not promoted as truth.
10914	If you hold religious beliefs, it is important to have evidence to back up these claims, as this allows individuals to validate these beliefs and gain a better understanding of the underlying truths. Furthermore, if an individual is unable to provide proof of their beliefs, it could potentially limit their ability to encounter the truth and thus impact their chances of salvation. In this respect, it is important to ensure that evidence is made available in order to allow individuals to make their own conclusions.
10915	Evolution is a scientific theory which states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have likely evolved from a common ancestor with early primates, as evidenced by their similar DNA structures and behavioral patterns. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average person's understanding of the term is. A scientific theory can only become fact when all aspects of it are discovered.
10916	Evolution has been widely accepted by science, including DNA tracing and archaeological findings such as Lucy. It is a scientific theory which states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have likely evolved from a common ancestor, as their DNA is highly similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns. While evolution is a scientific theory, it has been proven to be true through discovery of evidence. As such, it is more credible than creationism.
10917	Evolution has been supported by science, including DNA tracing as well as archaeological findings such as Lucy.  Evolution states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.  Humans likely descended from apes, as their DNA is very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns. These would be things such as using tools to find their food.  While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average person means when referring to a theory; it is probable when all the facts are known. This is the case for all scientific theories, including gravity and relativity.  Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
10918	Evolution is supported by scientific evidence including DNA tracing and the discovery of fossil remains such as Lucy. Evolution states that species can evolve over time to adapt to their environment. Humans are likely descended from early primates as their DNA is closely related and they share similar behavioral patterns, such as using tools to find food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is accepted as fact due to the existing evidence. Creationism is not as accepted or supported as evolution is due to its evidence.
10919	Evolution has been supported by scientific methods, such as DNA tracing and archaeological findings, including the fossil remains of Lucy. These discoveries suggest that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans are likely descended from common ancestors, as their DNA is very similar and they share similar behavioral patterns. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not the same definition used by the public; evolution is more likely to be true than creationism, as there is a greater amount of evidence to support it.
10920	I had a great experience here! My date enjoyed the prime rib and I enjoyed a burger that had three types of meat. The burger was cooked perfectly, and I am already yearning to go back for another bite. The only downside was the mac and cheese; I spoke with the manager, who told me that it is a new item and they are still perfecting it. We will definitely be returning in the future.
10921	I had a great experience here. My date had prime rib and I had a burger with three types of meat. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes, and the burger was cooked perfectly.

I had the chance to speak with the manager, who assured me that they are working on the item. We definitely will be returning.
10925	The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and inviting, giving it an almost cabin-like feel that fits in nicely with the Canadian comfort food theme. I've had a few dishes here, such as the lobster roll, Prince Edward Island mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend. The daily noodle, however, has been scarce on all three occasions - something I hope to try on my next visit.
10926	The restaurant provides an inviting atmosphere that mimics a cozy cabin, which enhances the Canadian comfort food theme. I have had several dishes, such as the lobster roll, PEI mussels and boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend.

10929	The atmosphere at The Kebek was pleasant and cozy, with a Canadian "comfort food" theme that was nice. I enjoyed several dishes, such as the lobster roll, Prince Edward Island mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I recommend. I missed out on the daily noodle on my three visits, but I will definitely be returning.
10930	We went in on a Monday night and there were several servers available, however, none of them came to take our drink order for about 15 minutes. The manager eventually came by, asked how we were doing, but then kept walking, which indicates that he was not genuinely interested in our experience. This is inexcusable, as our wait time points to a lack of care on his part.
10931	I visited the restaurant on a Monday night, and there were several servers available; however, it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. The manager eventually came by but only asked how we were doing and then continued walking. This indicates that the staff seemed less interested in ensuring customer satisfaction, which was surprising.
10932	We visited the restaurant on a Monday night and were surprised to find that there were no servers for the first 15 minutes. We left as we felt that the restaurant did not seem to value our presence. We were later approached by the manager who asked how we were doing, but he did so without stopping. This was somewhat bewildering as it seemed that the restaurant had not made an effort to engage their customers.
10933	We went to the restaurant on a Monday night, but after waiting for 15 minutes without any servers coming by to take our drink order, we left. The manager eventually asked how we were doing, but he did so while walking by without stopping or showing any genuine interest in our experience. This was surprising and dismaying.
10934	We went to the restaurant on a Monday night and were disappointed to find that there were no servers for the first 15 minutes. We left as we felt that the manager did not seem to care about our experience or make an effort to engage with us. This was unexpected as the manager asked how we were doing but did not seem to want to know our response.
10935	The food was excellent and our server, Samantha, was pleasant. However, it took a few minutes for our server to notice us and when she did, she ran to the table. We had to hurry up to catch up. In addition, I believe Samantha added a $3 tip to our card charge, which increased our bill to $47 and some change. We left a $10 cash tip, however, when I checked my bank account, I noticed an extra charge of $50, which was a mistake on our part. Be aware of this possibility.
10936	Food was delicious and our server Samantha (I think) was very pleasant. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us, she ran ahead of us to the table. We noticed that our bill was $47.95, and we later found out that a $3 tip had been added to the card charge. We would have questioned this if we had kept the receipt, but we unfortunately did not. This was an unfortunate mistake on our part.
10937	Our food was of a high quality and our server, Samantha, was pleasant. However, it took some time for our server to notice us, and when she went to seat us, she ran ahead of us, which caused us to catch up. Additionally, we noticed that Samantha had added an extra $3 charge to our bill, which we questioned, as we did not keep the receipt. Our total bill was $47, which we left a $10 cash tip for. We should have been more cautious and double checked the charges, which was our mistake.
10938	We had a positive experience with our food and our server Samantha was pleasant, however it took a while for the hostess to notice us and when she went to seat us, she ran ahead of us. We believe she may have added an extra $3 charge to our card, as the bill came to $47.95. We left a $10 cash tip, but since we did not keep the receipt, we could not verify this. Be aware of this potential mistake.
10939	The food was excellent, and our server Samantha was very nice. However, it took some time for the hostess to notice us and when she went to seat us, she ran ahead of us which caused us to have to catch up. We also noticed that our bill was $47.15, and the charge on our bank account was $50.15, which could have been a mistake on our part as we did not keep our receipt. We recommend being extra attentive when dining out to avoid such issues in the future.
10940	I had a positive experience at this restaurant. I tried two curries and pad Thai, all of which were very flavorful. However, the star of the meal for me was the staff's willingness to modify the flavor of my girlfriend's curry upon request. After she found it a bit too spicy for her taste, we asked the waiter to reduce the heat and he went back to the kitchen, who promptly brought us a new curry and rice that was cooked with less spice. This exemplifies the friendly customer service that I experienced here.
10941	I had a great experience at this restaurant. I sampled two curries and the Pad Thai. While the food was excellent, it was the restaurant's customer service that earned it 5 stars. My girlfriend found the curry a bit too spicy for her taste, so I asked the waiter if he could reduce the spice. He promptly went to the kitchen and returned with a new curry (with rice) cooked with less spice. Plus, we even received free ice cream!

10945	I was disappointed with my experience at the restaurant. Although it wasn't busy, our meals took an hour longer than expected. The food was not up to standard, as the sauce was primarily milk and the mushrooms too tough to chew. The stroganoff was inedible. I would suggest avoiding it.
