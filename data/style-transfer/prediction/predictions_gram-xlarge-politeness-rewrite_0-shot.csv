0	Students should feel free to wear what they like.
1	People shouldn't have to wear school uniforms. Each person has their own wish as to whether or not they want to wear school uniforms. I think each principal should think once again regarding the uniforms.
2	That form of argument degrades this forum, and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. The word "indisputable", I do not think it means what you think it means. I dispute your claim from personal experience, if nothing else. That makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.
3	I would not turn her in because she is my wife. She made a mistake, but we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did, then I couldn't do that to her.
4	No, I would not turn in my spouse. Just because the woman I married killed someone does not mean she is a bad person. People make mistakes.
5	TV is terrible, except for Spongebob, which is an okay show. The majority of television is awful, so I'd have to say books based on that.
6	I love books and I love getting lost in them. They also improve your literature, so my English teacher told me!
7	I would like to point out that when you read a book, you do not need to buy any reading devices, nor do you need to use electricity.
8	I think that books are better than TV because they are better, I can put you in the whole North World, and they are educational.
9	Books are enlightening. Books do not destroy children's morals. Books raise questions. Books take readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. Books change perspective on life and often give readers a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine.
10	India has strong military neighbors (China & Pakistan)...India has a bad relation with Pakistan as they have territorial disputes and have fought four wars for this. As far as China is concerned, India's relationship with China has also become tense due to the rise of territorial disputes and Indian interference in Pakistan. As for Pakistan, China has long term plans....for example Pakistan-China Economic Corridor and Gawadar Mega Oil City.
11	India is a very poor country.
12	India is a good adopter but a bad developer. The leader should be a great developer.
13	Russell Peters is very good at making fun of these people.
14	According to a recent report 50% of scientists in NASA are Indian IITians. Just imagine that if those scientists joined ISRO, then our status,value, and astronomical knowledge of India would definetly increase. Now,think about IITians and students who are qualifying iit. They are known to be superbrain. If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why are we unable to provide them a perfect job of their level? We are giving international status of education.then why aren't we able to take best advantages from them? This is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
15	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless. I'm not saying that not having a father is better than having one, albeit a bad one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself, for example. I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father. I turned out great. So yes, as opposed to having a bad father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would rather be completely fatherless.
16	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all, I would rather be fatherless than to have to deal with someone who would constantly frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only think about it from time to time. On the other hand, a bad father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
17	Raffles was followed by Farquhar during his visit to Singapore. This shows that Raffles saw Singapore before Farquhar, making him the founder.
18	Raffles had written his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819. It was later corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his first journey
19	It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without him, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island.
20	Raffles established a local magistrate in Singapore. This magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery being controlled. Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
21	That is interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind changing form in a few thousand years. Another question: with this whole "big bang" theory, it seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
22	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has its own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer, do you question whether there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than creationists.
23	Although I voted for evolution, creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.
24	Believing in "evolution" as in Darwinism and the like is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring out the pieces because two pieces are similar.
25	Firefox and its extensions seem to be consuming a lot of memory. For example, an opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, for one week uses 250 Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
26	Physical education should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy, then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. In addition, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
27	To me, a founder would be a leader well respected by the organization or group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times he left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, he was a more competent leader.
28	The only other choices are adoption or keeping it. I know many children are adopted, but many aren't and it might be better to just have an abortion. That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to decide one woman's pregnancy?
29	Who are we to decide what is right and wrong? Shouldn't we let people make their own decisions and live with the consequences?
30	Actually, we are evolving. Research this: every generation, our little toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we will end up losing it. I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage, and who really cares about it, but evolution is at work.
31	I understand that people have religious beliefs and that's fine by me; I think people should be able to do what they want without being judged on every move they make. However, it's scientifically proven that evolution is correct. What is your point?
32	So why don't we have talking monkeys? That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk (by talk, I assume you mean speech) because they are incapable of speech. We, on the other hand, have evolved to talk. Yes, if we are descended from monkeys, that doesn't stop monkeys from existing. We are a branch on the tree of life, not a dead end.
33	Porn is not wrong. If it was really wrong, then it should be illegal. Porn provides the "erotic" needs of people who do not have a partner. :)
34	Porn isn't inherently wrong because it can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice. It really is that simple.
35	They're either all virgins or still live at home with their mothers and can't have porn.
36	It is not wrong, and if you are talking about the actors doing the scene, it is their choice. They like doing it, and it is not degrading to women. We have freedom of expression, you know, and it also helps some of us to be open about sex.
37	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's champ. When wanting to be successful, sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when you always think about yourself and your personal pursuits, you tend to become conceited and become an awful person. An awful person is someone who is not liked, and when alone and not liked by others, becomes lonely.
38	I believe there are different ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do. For example, I feel happy helping others, but that does not mean I help every person in front of me. I try to do what I think is best and good in order to make somebody happy.
39	I think the common good is better than personal pursuit because it helps other people. I feel good when I help people because it makes me feel happy that I am doing something good in life.
40	It is a good thing, because this shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are, or what their religion is.
41	Wearing school uniforms, you can be sure that you go to school to study, not show off how fashionable you are.
42	Uniforms provide an equal and fair social status based on personality and not looks. I do half-admire wearing what you want is fun and creative, but it's only fun if everyone can do it. For some children, that isn't the case, and they can't afford to live up to their peers' standards. Uniforms would make social life much easier, and it would give a more mature look to the school.
43	The school uniform is a good idea. Why? Because it makes students concentrate more on their education, and I believe that school uniforms instill discipline among students. It makes students with different material statuses more equal.
44	I know that a bad father is very bad, and he probably won't do all the things that a good father would do, but at least you have that assurance that you have someone who is a father in your life. I believe that people can change. You can never feel the same way about somebody for your whole life. There will come a time in his life when he will realize that he needs to be there for you. If you have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.
45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the best way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So a bad father is better than none. (That is, of course, assuming that he is not abusive in any way.) Also, people change. Who says that he will be bad forever? There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
46	I believe that people are able to change and become better people. I would much rather have the hope that my father could have been a good father, than know that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could have been.
47	The next level thinks he is the next level. Atlas would drop the world to shake his hand.
48	The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. Additionally, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.
49	Water bottles can easily be made into long term fiber materials, like clothing or carpet. It is easy to just fill a cup with water and re use it.
50	TV is much more enjoyable than reading books from the old days!
51	TV is superior to books.
52	I love TV so much. I can watch whatever I want, and it's the best. You can watch DVDs and play on Playstations.
53	Most Americans recycle 86-88% of their bottle waters. That is more than half! So stop complaining that we do not recycle because we do! http://www.treehugger.com/culture/23-percent-of-americans-donatmt-recycle.html
54	Without plastic water bottles, there is only darkness every day.
55	Until we get out of this recession, we will be able to ban water bottles.
56	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships, or that it be called "civil unions."
57	There is no such thing as "gay marriage." Marriage can only be between a man and a woman.
58	I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America, and soon, when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime), India will excel. India has the potential.
59	India is a secular state. People from all communities reside here. India has the knowledge of almost all countries and the way they live. It can easily lead all the people of the world without creating any nuissance among anyone.
60	How can Indians say that India does not have the potential to lead the world? India is a heaven on Earth, and only India has the potential to lead the world. Believe yourself and hard work, and India will become the world's most powerful country.
61	I say no because spanking does not really solve the problem. Anyone can get over a spanking quickly and do whatever they did before. It is better to be a bit strict than to abuse a kid.
62	It depends on the severity of the kill. Of course, I would be sympathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings, I would probably leave and want nothing to do with it.
63	I would say that I would turn them in, because I don't believe that's right, killing someone and getting away with it. Also, I wouldn't want to be next to a murderer in my bed.
64	I would definitely turn them in, even if it bothers me. If a person commits a murder, they should not get away with it. It's dangerous to have them around. Also, if I don't turn her in, how do I know that later in life I won't be a victim?
65	The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. The government DOES have that right. For example, a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states. She cannot take illicit drugs into her body. She cannot murder others. She cannot steal. She cannot display her naked body in public. There are many others. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
66	I am pro-life, here is a question for anyone who is pro-choice: Is the fetus in the mother's stomach alive, and if not, how do you know?
67	In Nebraska, it is legal to have an abortion by killing the fetus as it is coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
68	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way you see a fetus...it's still a living form that has been created intimately...you shouldn't be changing what mothernature, God, fate, or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wanna get pregnant in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yes, there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate, but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the raping being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
69	There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have Pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.
70	If a woman is raped, that is a good argument. However, why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime? If the woman does not want the child, she could give it up for adoption. I just do not understand why you would kill the baby. The emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
71	I believe that homosexual marriage should be allowed. Many people who do not want it allowed just do not like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudiced. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever, why should they not be allowed to get married?
72	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded it. The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage.
73	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a choice.
74	If you do not like gay marriage and think it is wrong, then do not watch a gay couple kiss. Who are you to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings and that they are wrong? In the meantime, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to themselves. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
75	I believe that personal pursuits are more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. It may seem selfish at the time, but once you reach a point where you are good at what you do, you can help others do the same. Therefore, not only are you helping yourself, but you are also helping others.
76	Sallu, thank you for answering my question. Politics is very useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretically. Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are you frisked every time you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn. It's not politics that destroys people, it's the media projecting it. Whether you are Democrat or Republican, you must admit the media slanders whomever is in office. Clinton almost got impeached and the media was all over it. Cheeny with the gun accident, oh they are having a hayday. Just be patient, listen close, and vote!!!
77	Perhaps me: 1. I hate Bush. 2. I hate the Christian ethos that he's trying to push on the country. 3. I'm a pagan, so not a Christian, therefore I'm a threat. 4. I'm bisexual, and have had sex with guys, therefore I'm a threat. 5. I don't agree that what Bush is doing is right for this country. 6. I'm an individualist. I believe that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; rules, government, ect should be concerned with protecting our individual safety; not being concerned with controlling how we lead our lives, either on the spiritual or on the individual level. Because of this, I'm an anti-socialist :) Which makes me a direct threat to the government Bush is trying to create. Therefore, I'm sure that my name is somewhere on his 'long' list of 'offenders'.
78	It is as old as known history. The earliest civilizations practiced it back even in Mesopotamia (which is older than Egypt). It was not created by the "white devil" that you hear about today. I wonder how many blacks in America would be willing to go back in time and stop the importation of their ancestors... Africa has aids, drought, pestilence, civil wars, ethnic genocide, and no economy. America sounds pretty good after all!
79	If you want to maintain contact with your children, then you must act as a parent and fight for them. California is fairly equitable when it comes to fathers. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you, unless you are found unfit for some reason. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the lastest court order. Good luck, and you really need to fight for this. Your children need to have contact with their father, it may scar them for life. You do not want them to think you abandoned them, do you?
80	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably speak to one about this, but here's my two cents. The full legal text says, "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works." Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
81	No, that is the beauty of the United States of America; you have no health care. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes? Your brother is in jail for a reason; maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes, he would not be in this situation. Jail has no company benefits.
82	Yes. If you execute a murderer, he will never escape, he will never hurt anyone else. And it helps the victim's family heal. The thought that a murderer is still alive disgusts the families of the victims. There is something intrinsically just about executing a murderer, because the victim will never have another birthday, will never have another holiday with their families. Some crimes are so vile that the only punishment can be death.
83	Skating is not illegal, but skating in certain public places is. I used to work at a store, and kids would skate on our sidewalk. They almost killed some of our elderly customers. That's why it's illegal in some places, because you could run over people who are just walking around.
84	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thought? How long will it take you to formulate an unpopular belief? Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?
85	Usually, that isn't the question that guys are asking. Oh, maybe you aren't the dad, but the mom. My bad. If you were the dad: You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse. Otherwise, you can request a review. It takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed. Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't. Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own. You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own. Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant, and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job. It goes by a percentage of his income.
86	Unfortunately, I agree that unless there is something in it for us, it's difficult to persuade the US to send troops to police the world. However, I applaud it when we do. The problem is that we always get caught up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, thus we fall short and it looks like a half-hearted attempt with casulties that we have a hard time stomaching. Look up a group called Executive Outcomes to see how it's done right.
87	No, if you are connected to city sewers, you have to pay. Check with your city councilman. They probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed. Even if it was a city oversight. It's a service you have to pay for. They charged me extra sewer when I filled my pool, 6000 gallons worth, even though it didn't go down the drain. If they can charge you, they will. Especially if all your neighbors are connected, they don't give you a choice.
88	Contrary to what most people think, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone. Unless someone can cite a specific Illinois law, chances are the answers you get here are of little value. While 15 or 16 might sound like logical numbers, that doesn't mean the answers are correct on the law. I don't know Illinois law nor am I going to make up some number for you.
89	In a free society, there is no such thing as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. If you read the newspaper, browse the internet, watch TV, etc. you will be offended in the West. You do have the right to protest peacefully, picket, etc.
90	I feel that this is totally against everything that is American. How about everyone straps a GPS system to their legs so the government knows where everyone is. Besides this, the government is saying it is all for public safety. I don't know how safe I feel if I know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break. If I wanted to blow something up, I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
91	I would say not all foreigners... maybe unrealistic, but it would depend on what country they are from... Just as the entire world has favorites and dislikes, I think the disliked nations already know why... If a nation is violent and not good for the world, and the government lies, steals, and kills innocent humans... well then... it is not well liked... or the people either... because the government is supposed to represent the people... So... it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
92	We need a law to create a national driver's license. We need the law because a national driver's license will make the country more secure against terrorists. Many of the 9-11 terrorists had driver's licenses that they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill. The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address. The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
93	Is it Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader? Well, let's quote him. He once wrote, "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is spreading regardless of attempts to stamp it out. There is still oppression in the world, and there is still a thirst for freedom from it, so why not? The same basic conditions apply as when he was alive.
94	In a way you have raised an interesting point. However, I would like to challenge you on a larger scale... Do our laws reflect our morality, or do our laws stem from the morality we make each other abide by? In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them. Think on that a bit as you ponder your own question. In my personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.
95	The appeal must be won. The court holds the conviction annulled, void, as if it no longer exists. Expungement of the records is another matter, and that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record, even with a court order.
96	If my neighbor smokes marijuana, it doesn't hurt me, it doesn't break my leg, it doesn't infringe on my rights. How is that my business? My neighbor's body belongs to him, and he has a right to take risks with that body.
97	You are not racist for wanting your family to have equal rights as others. In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and raised in the country. Unfortunately, here in Britain that is not the case. We actually have less rights while receiving less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as opposed to immigrants who get much more of our money that we worked for which they take.
98	Your crime does not fit under discrimination, as you committed that crime. That was a choice, unlike race, gender, etc...I do not think that everyone will turn you down, I typically look at the crime when hiring, and believe me, there are a lot more people out there with records than you would guess. If someone was a thief, or violent, I will not hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason. It may just be that here in Michigan the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so rampant, that their just aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking.
99	This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when committing the same act. I am referring to "Hate Crime" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. For example, if one person kills another person because he hates that person's ethnicity or religious views, then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and not just the act.
100	Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good. They are not permitted to give legal advice. That having been said, why don't you give us more details about the judgement. What was it for? When was it perfected? Why do you say that it is expired. What state do you live in? In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years. If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever. The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged. Chances are real slim on that. Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
101	I think you have a case. Did you happen to take pictures of all of these "repairs"? Sometimes just the threat of small-claims court will get them to write a check. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they tried to repair the stand indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
102	With the other issues of dependency on the government aside, you need one to protect yourself. Regardless of whether the police are there to protect you, if you have a person break into your house at night, you may not have time to call the police. Even if you do, and they are only five minutes away, you can be killed a hundred times over in five minutes. You have a right and a duty to defend yourself and your family.
103	I think prostitution is overrated; if people want to have sex and get paid, they should be able to. A woman can have sex with many men and not get anything, but if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute. Why? Why give it up for free. My opinion is if a guy friend of mine wants to have sex with me and my light bill is due, and I don't have it, why not, get the bill paid and feel good while doing it.
104	Our borders should be closed. We are at war. We cannot afford to take care of these people. We are not even taking care of ours. No one has a reason to teach them English. They can learn to speak English before coming here to take the test. If I go to a foreign country, I don't expect them to take the time to teach me their language. It's not even realistic. They need to go work at bettering their country just like we are trying to do. How many of these "illegal immigrants" are fighting in our war? They need to go home and fix their country, while we try to fix ours. Close our borders. And if you think we are on our feet, do some checking around. It won't take you long to see what a shape we are in.
105	There are many types of abuse mental, physical, neglect, maybe she just does not want you around anymore. Perhaps it is payback for something you did, and she just can't get over what you did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind, "If he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore." It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is."
106	First of all, cops (and no one else) do not piss you off. You choose to be. If you choose not to be pissed off, then you won't be. It's called a victim mentality. You own your emotions, no one else. Secondly, since I am a cop, I can say this much... I remove skaters from areas that are posted with no skateboarding signs, where vandalism is a common occurrence or where there are trespass warnings (both the kind you see and the kind you never knew). I do not, nor do I know any other officers, that set out to "piss" people off. It is merely enforcing the laws that are applied upon them. You may not be a problem, but the two dozen other skateboarders before you might have been.
107	To an extent, what is commonly referred to as racial profiling makes sense. For example: A car load of black or hispanic kids are rolling around a mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am, plates get run, and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good. I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around the hood,in high drug areas,etc. That, contrary to popular belief, is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled and I don't personally see it as a violation of one's right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous.
108	You are mistaken my dear, they have not been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharastra. The Gov had shut them down because they had received many complaints from the housewives about their male family members wasting money on these bars and not looking after their families. Also, many criminal activities took place at these bars. U must be aware of the tarannum and telgi cases where tarannum's monthly income was about 1 lac and telgi would throw away nearly 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on these criminal activities the Gov of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
109	First off, the ancient rite of war that every nation has lived by, including the Lakota, which removed the nation that was here before them. The winner of war gets the land. While there was some chicanery and our forefathers only really won a hand full of battle, the Indian Wars were more a war of attrition, and the Native Americans lost the land due to that fact. Yes, we have contributed to the land. There are more trees than were on the continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food we need to survive.
110	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliation, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case separately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world. Scary stuff.
111	Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father.
112	I have grown up around religious people my entire life, they always told me abortion is wrong, murder, and immoral. But I slowly realized that this never made any sense. It is someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. If it matters, I am Christian, 16 years old, and male.
113	I do not understand how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of a case. The way that both sides draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them seems deceptive. In addition the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence), people decide which argument is better seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth. What are the arguments in favor of this system?
114	I hate to be a downer, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left. I want to believe that things will be all right, but when you keep hearing news about the environmental degradation of the planet, even if you are still somehow a denier about climate change, you have to admit the oceans are polluted and large numbers of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.
115	For the international CMVs, the term "greece" refers to a social component of my university that throws parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.* A lot of people may say that to some extent everything is alright, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned. By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a "joke" to those who attend in attire. Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnic students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.
116	Every time I hear the Wilhelm scream, which has been used in over 200 films, I am completely removed from the scene, and sometimes even laugh at what might be a serious scene. Often, it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects a lack of effort from the director, and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no regard to what effect this has on the film. I understand that it is an "in-joke," but I believe that it is too widely recognized to be used any more without the audience acknowledging it.
117	For instance, prostitution stings and drug deal stings should be illegal. Anything that does not have a victim and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution sting, that is one thing. However, setting people up for these crimes, to me, seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.
118	The title is self explanatory. Vladimir Putin is the head of a disappointed ex-empire, willing to gain its former glory. The Russian people are traditionally obedient, willing to submit to an autocratic will, and ready to devote itself to general patriotic ideals (i.e. getting new territories). The guy seems very determined not to comply with Western moral and political values, and seems defiant to the present unanimity of attitudes against his latest moves. It is already quite obvious that Russia's stances in international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation, and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable, no matter how.
119	With the exception of the moon, where the dirt bike is amazing for rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave, the downforce keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailored made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!
120	First of all, we are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8 billion is its budget. If it was useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8 billion more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year, and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min? I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!
121	I am under the impression that a man's first love is his strongest love, and every following love is a bit weaker each time. Also, each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love. It's akin to chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time. I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love, the veil falls, and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.
122	With all the hoopla over the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death, which I don't think was truly accidental, but that's for another CMV, I'm reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most, if not all, of the bad he did in the public conscience. I know MJ isn't an isolated case, and it seems to be the rule for people who die young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage, I can't see any reason why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad deeds scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanser for one's legacy. Am I alone in this?
123	These days, we grant more rights to convicts than we ever have. While I appreciate people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this.
124	I am not speaking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child). Most of my parents' argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. It's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me does not mean I like them or need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
125	I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense. There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place. CMV.
126	It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I believe John Hammond had a great vision, but was poorly advised by his HR department, thus severely underpaying his most vital employees. Other than that: - The Park would be a major boost to the economy of the Dominican Republic, as well as any other nation where it opens shop. - It would motivate kids across the globe to venture into science disciplines. - It would further our understanding of our planet. The possibilities are endless. As long as we *spare no expense* Can you CMV?
127	Video games should be treated as a drug. Millions of lives are affected because people do not monitor their usage or do not use them in moderation. Especially children who are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over their lives and social skills. It is so sad. I feel so strongly about this because I went through the same thing as a child and I wish more than anything to go back and change it. But also, I am grateful because now I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone again. Let's start a petition!
128	It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate with people since we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do not understand why anyone would want to post about their feelings or what they are doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if Billy Bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers.
129	If Iraq has taught us anything, it is that brutal, repressive dictators have their place in the world. If this administration had any intelligence, they would have had a Delta squad hunkered down right under the gallows with a stepstool, ready to spirit Saddam away to his rightful place in the capital. It takes a mean bastard to run a 160,000 square-mile lunatic asylum.
130	As powerful as Superman is- he does have a noted vulnerability to psionic powers, so professor X (or phoenix, or apocalypse) would be able to control, trap, or destroy him. And Batman has no powers, just gadgets, Magneto could make short work of him. And the Flash? So he runs. Wow. Oh yeah, professor X could take him down too. In fact, he could probably take them all out by himself without all the other godlike marvel characters.
131	Yes, it will recover - provided the government stops its meddling and 'bailing out' measures. It's things like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression.' As part of the'measures,' then instituted were some of the Union laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive. I wish lawmakers HAD TO take at least SOME relevant history while in high school.
132	I hear all too often that science is "playing God." We have superceeded the need for natural selection, and we must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999, we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments, to the point that we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If God did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If God wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.
133	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued so that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, if found intact, then guns pose a threat because there is no way for those bullets to be traced back to owners so they can account for the shots they fired. It's like giving someone a jaguar as long as they promise to never let it out of their sight. It's ridiculous.
134	I'm not sure where you live, but here in Southern California we have pizza delivery services available until 3:00 a.m. Plus, I'd rather go to Del Taco anytime over Taco Smell or Taco Hell. Back in the 1960s, before Taco Fell became part of another multinational corporation, they were good. In our high school days, we went there to cure the munchies, tacos were 5 for a buck. JJ
135	I see that there are actually no arguments, so I'm just going to clarify a few things for the 'Yes' argument. Even though Principals do obtain the right to search (for drug tests, even making the student take off his/her socks if the dog sniffs something on that student), they only retain that right in the event of reported drugs or crime, or in the case that sniffer dogs checks are enacted and the dog smells something. There are restrictions - a principal can't just demand to search a student's possessions on whim - outlined in the Criminal Code, YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws). Thus, the right keeps the entire student body safe and away from harmful substances.
136	First off, bribing a child is defined as saying things like "Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on, mommy will buy you a toy after we are done at the doctor's office" or "Karen, if you take the garbage out, I'll buy that blouse you wanted" or "It's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you get off we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted" or "Just eat your vegetables and I'll give you extra icecream." These are all examples of lying to your child to get them to do what you want.
137	I have had this discussion with my brother various times. I think that the name 'Sublime' does not accurately describe the band to which it refers. First, there are multiple definitions for the word. 'Elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc.' certainly does not describe the band, nor does 'impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc.' But what about'supreme or outstanding'? Of course, there is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I think, would be that the name does not describe the band. I do not have anything against the band, or their choice of name. In fact, I like a few of their songs. But it is certainly ironic that'sublime is not sublime.'
138	Sure, why not? It's an art and takes time to perfect, no different than cooking, so starting early would mean perfecting it sooner. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be drunks later on in life, it's still up to the person's discipline. There a lot of young drunks who were never bartenders, I think what they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alcohol and its effects.
139	So you dispute the Pontias Pilate account and testimony of the Jewish leaders? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. Pilate's wife begged that Jesus be released. Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter. Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie. And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene. And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption. The whole controversey is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead.
140	The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term memory. For example, if a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning. Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
141	I strongly believe that before having children, prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests. Kids need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have a few cases where the parents are not very intelligent and the kids strive to be different than their failure parents, but in most cases it is an endless line of parasites on our world. We need more smart people.
142	The reason marriage should be kept sacred is for what the man and woman will produce, a child. It is the best and most natural arrangement to raise a happy and healthy child. It is the continuation of the family unit. A man and a man or woman and a woman are not going to grow more branches of the tree, so it should be called something else.
143	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely, and if allowed to continue, the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression. When you give the government the right to print money that isn't backed by anything, you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing. Finally, every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt. Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
144	Almost twenty debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The running average in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day. There should be a maximum posted per day, possibly having someone else wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something like that. This would give people a chance to read current ones. Too many debaters are putting time and effort into the current open debates, and then having them fall further down the list, leading to less people reading and responding to them. (And I know someone will jump at the chance to call this an open debate that is 'just another one pushing others down') but I felt this had to be said.
145	iPhone, of course. Blackberry is now for the senior businessmen market. The iPhone represents the 21st century, while Blackberry represents an outdated technology. iPhone can reach a very diversified clientele: young, adult, active, rich, less rich population. Blackberry has always targeted an elite. With the iPhone, we are the elite, and we can play spies as well as listen to cool music.
146	I am an Englishman who predominantly enjoys English music, yet I would argue that America has birthed greater music. The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz, which as we all know originated in the U.S. Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones, or any other major British band prior to 1977. Don't forget there's also Hip-hop and Punk, both original American art-forms which have had a major influence upon the UK music scene since the late seventies and early eighties. In terms of popular music, the U.S. leads where the UK follows and adapts.
147	Obama = good judgement, steady in crisis, curious minded, cares about all the people, not just the wealthy, wants to build a green economy. McCain = ourt dated thinker, not curious minded, too ingrained into the system he claims to want to change, has stolen every good position he has in this election from Obama, running a vile campaign and he approves the message.
148	I believe that it was a learning experience for our country. Without prohibition, who knows what would be happening now. I think that by having the prohibition law THEN, we were able to see that it didn't work, and we can decide better on circumstances like that in the future. While it wasn't a strictly "good thing", I do not believe it was a bad thing for our country to go through.
149	Garry, I would not want to. First of all, you won't be able to see your friends and family members if you are alive for a long time. Second, you will be so old that you won't be able to move around much. You will be sick. (Death's better than this!) Third, even if you feel excruciating pain, you won't die. (Suffering...) Torture...
150	I would say it is good food if you are a person who likes big burgers, but I am not one of those people. I find it over rated. My girlfriend recommended it. The fries are good, very fresh, but I wouldn't go there for the fries. They have bags of peanuts that you can put into little paper bowls and munch on while you wait. The decor is like a 50's diner. So if you like big juicy burgers, then yes, go here. But I personally, it is a no.
151	I will not be returning.
152	I have been here before, but now that Yama sushi has become popular and big, the sushi has twice the amount of rice than before, and less fish. Also, the service has dropped significantly. Also, they recently received a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations, most of which were the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or make sure you get good service.
153	I was hoping for a lot better than what I got, but I won't be returning.
154	We were lucky to have a 20 minute wait. This place is highly recommended, but our oysters were given to the wrong people. This caused us to not receive ours until after our main dishes came out. Then we tried to eat them and they were not even shucked correctly. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast which was very good, but a bit too rich for my tastes. I would return, but only if there was no line.
155	I ordered chicken chow mein and my coworker ordered beef chow fun. First of all, our delivery took an hour. Second, the delivery driver dropped our Thai tea, spilling the contents of the containers all over the floor. Finally, he didn't have change. How can you be a delivery driver if you don't have change? Finally, the food. My coworker said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible! And the grease. So much grease! If you are craving good, quality Chinese food, this is definitely not the place to go!
156	My husband and I went to The Salt Cellar for our anniversary. The steak they served him was rancid. It ruined the entire evening. In fact, not long after that we decided to become vegan. It was that bad of an experience for two people who loved seafood and steaks. But at the very least we are healthier for it. Needless to say, we will not be returning.
157	I truly believe that wearing uniforms is bad, because it does not help students to express their individuality. It is also very uncomfortable, and during wintertime it may be very cold. That is why schools should not force students to wear uniforms.
158	Firefox is much better, that's all I have to say.
159	I will give you some reasons why I prefer Firefox over other browsers.
160	Honestly, Firefox just works better. The tabbed interface, the lack of activeX, and RSS support. The Internet is trying to still catch up to Firefox, in my opinion.
161	Firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. Add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love the tabs, aging and remembering them when you close the browser, Weatherfox, gestures, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work). And the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. Much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because I don't want to support Microsoft. Because I don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
162	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There are so many beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?
163	I love Firefox and defend it, but what is odd is that this site is not working on it.
164	I'm not sure. It depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self-defense, then no, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone, then yes.
165	I would turn him in for murder. I am not sure if I would try to convince him first to turn himself in, but if that did not happen, then I would have to assume responsibility for him. Additionally, I would not want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I did not turn that murder in. If he truly loved me, he would not have killed someone.
166	No, I would not. I would have taken a vow to stand by them, in sickness and in health. She might be mentally unstable, but she would be my wife. If anything, I would try to prevent her from being caught.
167	No, I would not be able to turn them in. If you truly loved someone, you would do anything to help them, especially if it was an accident. However, if he killed someone just because he felt like killing someone, it may be a little different, because I wouldn't want him to go nuts and kill me too.
168	Books offer improvement in grammar and spelling skills, plus they are more creative. With TV, everything is done for you. With books, you can imagine the characters' looks and the setting with your own little creativity in it. Plus, you can take books anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
169	With the cream layer quota system, I don't prefer India to be leading the world in the near future. Yes, India has the potential, but corruption, this quota system, which isn't helpful to anyone, and the main reason for brain drain do not specifically help India in the matter.
170	It is better to be fatherless. Having a bad father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fathered. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a bad father, for a girl, would mean having a bad boyfriend as well. By not having a father, you don't have to worry about how terrible they are, and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could have been.
171	I would rather be fatherless than have a father who isn't good and does absolutely nothing for his children. Most kids look up to their dads, but if they aren't good fathers, then why have them around? It just means that the kid will want to be just like his dad. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
172	Raffles was the boss of farquhar and thus should have been the founder of Singapore since he was the leader and had more rights than farquhar. In addition, farquhar did not carry out his duties responsibly and allowed slaves, cockfighting, and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
173	Pornography is definitely wrong. Pornography is an addiction for some people, which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. Pornography gives an unhealthy image of what sex is all about.
174	Are you a Christian or anything? If not, then who's to stop you! For the record, yes it is wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.
175	Why do you assume that God needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time?
176	Until Firefox is preinstalled on PCs, IE will continue to dominate.
177	If Firefox is the best, why do people try to have sites that are IE compatible?
178	I have been an IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences, such as the availability of tabs in Firefox which was not available in IE, I do not find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also, now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. So I think IE is better than Firefox.
179	Fire Fox does not allow pop-ups on some websites like Novanet. You need Internet Explorer to install such websites.
180	I use Firefox, but there are some websites that don't work well with it. Until it is more mainstream, I will use Internet Explorer.
181	Yes, because: First, it's a fun activity during the school day; we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our exercise -- lose the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but... Second, obesity is certainly a problem in the United States, so it would help! Third, People can have a moment where they eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!
182	I believe schools should have PE because my school only has PE for middle school, not high school. Because of this, many students are out of shape and have developed many bad habits, such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol. As for their first year of sports, their athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre-season conditioning, and they say, "if we had PE, conditions would be easier, and would have made conditioning simple." The lack of exercise caused them to only accomplish three push-ups.
183	Sorry, one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of WHY I find adoption a less than desirable alternative to abortion. It's funny how people just ignore what they can't or don't want to argue against. If you're going to write a rebuttal to someone's argument on here, then click "view all" first. This gives you a history of their arguments and it may help to eliminate the need for that person to REPEAT themselves by addressing something they've already addressed.
184	I support pro choice, if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government.
185	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both parties happy?
186	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, then we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. If it isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
187	A woman should be able to decide if she wants an abortion or not, at any stage of her pregnancy. Why do most anti-abortion advocates favor the death penalty? Jon Jax 71
188	Just a note to the creationists. Please use the "Convinced me" link correctly. You're supposed to click this if the argument convinced you that creationism is true. Some of you seem to be clicking anything and everything on the right hand side. This will not help you win the debate, by the way.
189	Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are religious. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
190	I am confused. I understand that you are speaking in favor of evolution and against creationism. At most, you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can co-exist. A great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea.
191	Not at all. But in your line of argument, believing in "creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers, would he? You clearly do not understand evolution. Read a book or two.
192	Whoever said porn degrades women is an idiot. First of all, they get compensated well, secondly, they choose to do it, thirdly, some girls actually like what they do, and fourthly, without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life.
193	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is ebil and degrading" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there's no such thing as porn *actors." (What, men don't count?) Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "feminist" bullshit.
194	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you don't do it behind your partner's back. It's only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
195	I feel that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do a lot of good in the long run. I believe in the "what goes around comes around" thing, so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them, but something good will also come back to you, helping you better yourself.
196	This is very unfortunate, as the uniforms are also cost-effective.
197	I think school uniforms are a good idea. I agree that many pupils do not like them, but there are benefits. As other people have said, children do not have to think about what to wear at first. That is a major problem for teenagers.
198	Children have two role models; mom and dad. Parents affect their children's behavior and personality, so if that relationship is damaged, then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless, because the damage of a bad father would scar my personality far more than being fatherless.
199	I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father to be of a low quality, and I think that I am doing just fine. I just think that it is better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him or what he looks like would be an insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion, just to know he exists would be better for me.
200	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless, because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is, rather than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I were to grow up without a father, I would grow up with an emptiness inside me.
201	A thirsty man will value a drop of water more than a sack of gold.
202	Yes, it is creating serious environmental issues. When people realize that it is in turn hurting us as humans, they may not want that plastic after all.
203	The major water producing companies are stealing water from our lakes and in the process, killing off habitats for critters that like water, such as platypus.
204	The other side is only posting song lyrics, which has nothing to do with water.
205	He doesn't give high fives; he only gives high sixes. He is the Godfather's godfather. He once taught a German Shepherd to bark in Spanish.
206	I believe books are better. I believe I can fly. That is so true.
207	I think TV is better because it's faster and some people can't read.
208	Jesus loves plastic water bottles, and you cannot argue with that.
209	If being homosexual was natural, then there would only be six people on earth. Secondly, if homosexuality was natural, then the butthole would be in the front of the body. It has never been accepted as "natural" by society, only till now. I'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how it's unfair.
210	India's growth will be greater than any other country in the world after 2012.
211	India can speak English better than an original English man. Britishers and Americans have a lot of grammatical mistakes, so who is better? Indians! "truth is stranger than fiction."
212	We should not forget Lord Rama, Krishna, Vishvamitr, etc., which give a far view that India will be the Vishvguru in future.
213	With a rapidly growing population and an increasing economy, India is on a par with China to become the greatest economic powers in the world.
214	Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God, or they can believe there isn't, but they can never know for sure. I personally believe there isn't a God, but I can never prove this definitively.
215	Atheism; I need at least some evidence before I believe in magic.
216	I am an atheist because I believe that we all have one life to enjoy and preserve for all future generations.
217	Christianity is perhaps the most repulsive ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral. (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html)
218	Did I also mention that Christianity condones slavery? If I did, I'm sorry.
219	Spanking can sometimes be good for the child to understand, but only to a point where you can hurt yourself and should not be used repeatedly.
220	I believe some parents should spank their kids, but only when necessary. Sometimes, that is the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
221	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child. Parents have many other options before spanking. It is better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
222	Spanking children will be bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children. It doesn't make sense.
223	Yes, I will turn him in to the police because he committed a murder and that is a sin. Perhaps if he is arrested, he will feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. Additionally, how can I trust a murderer? He could be telling me a lie and possibly could kill me for someone else in the future. Just by confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
224	For everyone who is talking about RAPE in this subject, I would like to ask you one question: If you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm, would you cut it off just because it would remind you of that experience? If you are actually sane, you would say no, and if you say yes, you need to see a psychiatrist.
225	When people condemned cannibalism in Africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? No. Why should abortion be any different?
226	What I do not understand is how people rationalize taking life. It just doesn't make any sense. Regardless of the situation in America, how is killing legal?
227	EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roommates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits. Civil unions are gone, gay marriage is in!
228	If heterosexuals are permitted to marry and do whatever they wish, why should homosexuals be prevented from doing the same?
229	One reason is that many more people now agree with this side.
230	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what your common good is. You have to know when you are a better person, and then share your good with others.
231	I believe that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again, I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need, you do anything to help that family member. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you'll help the family member out, instead of the random person you don't know.
232	At this time, I would have to choose a personal pursuit. I have goals set, and would like to accomplish them before I can begin to help others. Although I enjoy helping others, it is me who needs to be helped first.
233	I believe we should be able to die with dignity. While there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medication to end their life. I have watched relatives die of cancer; no one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
234	I think the best way to select our candidates is to have actual facts as to how they voted on any and all issues when they were in government. This way you know if this person is voting the way you want them to on the issues that are important to you. What was their absent record? After all, aren't we all their bosses to some extent? We put them in office. The thing that irks me the most is the raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put on the ballot, it's whether or not they should have a pay raise. After all, where else can you go to work and decide, "I am giving myself a pay raise." However, it's all a bunch of propaganda with mudslinging.
235	The internet is still such a recent phenomenon, that laws and policies are being created as we speak. But unless you're pretty certain they'll be okay with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well. A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to theirs. But some people don't mind if you put the URL. Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
236	Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harrassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the rules against sexual harrassment in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment. However, I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
237	I completely agree with you, these days with DNA it's easier to prove someone is guilty, so when it's proven that someone is 100% guilty, hang 'em! Especially paedophiles, they are the lowest of the low. As for the answer from the government, it may not have prevented further murders, but at least it is less of a burden on the taxpayer to support scum like that in prison.
238	Personally, I detest it. However, I find it necessary evil since my husband and I own our own electrical company that offers 24 hour service. We get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cell phones when we are not at the office. However, we always put our phones on silent or vibrate when we are in a public place. That way we do not disturb anyone around us.
239	I do not understand why not, since people in Europe are permitted to drink at the age of 16, Germany in particular, and Mexico was 18 before it became 21, so I think the reason why it is 21 is because people in the U.S. are too stupid to act right. Why is the drinking age in other countries lower, and they actually have fewer accidents or other problems? Think about that!
240	I think more rehab centers should be built, but better ones. In jail they will NEVER become a productive member of society, and in most rehabs, they won't either. The ones that are good are too expensive for the common druggie to pay for, so they quit and end up in jail. Put the people who hurt other people in jail, not the ones who just need help or aren't hurting anyone but themselves. And if they are hurting family because of the drug problem, my question is, why does the family not get them help and support them with it?
241	It is legal to use race as one of a number of factors in determining admissions. This was decided by the Supreme Court (Bakke decision). The ruling stated that race cannot be used as the primary factor in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process. Although no company will ever admit to quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life for many people.
242	Yes, you can get a ticket for blocking your drive way in Los Angeles County. It's actually against the law to block any drive way, whether it's your own or not. If you block a drive way and an emergency arises, how will people who park there get their car moved if you're gone and you didn't leave the car keys? Also, what if emergency personnel need to get to your backyard, etc. It's even against the law to block a sidewalk.
243	I think black people shouldn't say either because it still is a word that divides races. If two black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n-word, the white kid will want to say the word too because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't greet them in the friendly manner they greet each other. On the other hand, I am one of the few African Americans who feel this way. And I do agree, why does it really matter so much to white Americans? You can't have this one word, you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing?
244	This debate has made me feel that the government should not interfere with the marriage business. Let churches perform marriages for whomever they see fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. As for plural "marriages," they exist, but there is not a large majority who support them. That is another debate for another day, and the issues are quite different. In my opinion, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
245	It amazes me how people can be against capital punishment and pro-abortion. Respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murderers, but kill all the babies you want".
246	I think those people that have children are selfish and are thinking only of themselves. Think about the children. I wouldn't want to have a mother that is mentally ill or a father who is in a wheelchair. Think about it. My answer is no. Give the kids a home where they have a mother who can bake cookies for them and a father who can go out back and play baseball with them.
247	You really need to stop driving. Really.
248	If the remaining 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was an instance of incest, or that their health would not tolerate it? And then women would use metal hangers again, quite unhealthy. I agree that reducing abortions in the US would be good. Birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
249	It would be little different from owning a block of land. Most or all islands are either the responsibility of a nearby country or are called a protectorate of a country, so even though you owned that "island block" you could not do as you wish. Though there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has, but remember who is going to police them.
250	If your society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people on a racial basis, then there is no difference. That kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior. Simply because there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available. If white Anglo-Saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they'd pretty much match the criminal profile.
251	If you take bad advice from an Internet chat/question and answer site, it is your fault! Stop trying to find ways to sue people. You are not hiring someone for legal advice on Yahoo Answers. See a licensed attorney in your state if you need legal advice. If you do something EXTREMELY stupid as a result of a website, you were EXTREMELY stupid to begin with. After all that, I would love to give you some case law and advice about liability, but that would be legal advice and my lawyer is not in today to write me up a disclaimer to add at the bottom of this.
252	I have always been bothered by pricing based on age. For example, movies. A seat is a seat. Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat? And what is the point of a "senior discount"? I hear the same old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income". What does that mean? Aren't we all on "fixed income"? My income doesn't vary. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs. And what is this "kids eat free" nonsense? Why can't I eat free? I mean, Geez, the kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every 5th meal free and I guarantee I'll come back to your restaurant. p.s. For those who misunderstood the question, Jr. isn't in jail.
253	I agree. I do not smoke marijuana, but I think it should be legalized. Think of how much money the government would save or make.
254	If you confront this woman in person, she will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you anonymously send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations. You could have a meeting with the General Manager, and ask for anonymity. However, you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her intent to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge. Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, and most importantly, a CONSISTENT story from each person who was a witness to any of these events. You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable proof, the General Manager will have to act.
255	I had the opportunity to visit Dar a few weeks ago. To answer each of your questions separately may be difficult for me. But maybe my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions. First and foremost, what I felt is that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is a great amount of tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to acomplish. I am sure Tunisia has a lot of potential, but if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Tunisia can develop into an exemplary country, my response would be "Yes, but there is a long way to go and a lot to change before that."
256	I often ask myself the same question. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job of terrorizing his supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 affect how we live. The crayola chart is really only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (public servants) In the name of'I don't like that party ', people will side with him as well. So Bush could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him becuase they so much dislike the opposing political party.
257	It is not going to happen. People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, maybe it sucks that there are such big consequences for it, but really, you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It is not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if people were thrown into jail for that. You can't stop anybody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discourage it, the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That is the only way they learn.
258	This situation has nothing to do with a lease...it's your business if you give the key to your apartment to someone, especially for the reasons you stated. No extra person is staying there, it's not a sublet, you're doing nothing wrong...sounds to me like your landlord is way too nosey, you are most def within your rights.
259	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. You are correct that it has not been used in a violent crime. I am not sure where it happened but so far only one person in the U.S. has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and I believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very impractical for any criminal. When California passed the law Barrett actually ended the warranties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so California made an exception for.50cal blackpowder rifles! (which are easier to get by criminals)
260	It is sad that you can not even trust the people who are supposed to protect you. However, if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own way. Some just do not even notice it. Racism is sad, though, and we should all look at each other the same way. People are like crayons. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but we all still have to live in the same box.
261	If you want to ask for forgiveness direct from GOD through Jesus Christ, then be a Christian, not a Catholic. Catholics worship saints and idols like Virgin Mary, and so on, whereas Christians worship only God in Jesus Christ. Those are just some of the many differences between Christians and Catholics. Pick your choice wisely.... If I'm wrong, do correct me. May God Bless you.
262	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists. Additionally, because they have been steadfast in the Global War on Terror, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining that position, and terrorists are more likely to try to scare citizens of those countries. Therefore, the US and the UK have been more aggressive than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
263	I do not like the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom it is supposed to represent should allow someone to do so if they want to. After all, what is being destroyed is only a piece of cloth. Making a law which prohibits us from burning the flag does much more damage than the act itself. You lose so much more by taking away people's freedom.
264	If that happens, the US will pull all our funding and whatever troops that are under their peacekeeper control. Without US support, there is no UN. So they can try. I would love to get rid of that organization. It has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway. Well, the Bay of Pigs, but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry.
265	The First Amendment protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses. As far as I'm concerned, if two men want to freely associate, they can do it as much as they like. But the day you tell me that marriage is mandatory, that's the day I leave the United States. No one is going to force me to get gay married.
266	I think that in the end it will be a gimmick. Why would the big supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans, etc. when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods? And when we are all brainwashed into the money making "carbon footprint" idea, how do you justify flying food around the world just to help the poor? I don't think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic, even though it is riddled with GM. It's just snobbery.
267	I am very grateful that this woman was permitted to die without being at the center of a terrible storm of public controversy played out among people who don't even know her. Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I'm very grateful she had family with her, shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
268	I believe that this kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur. If these works are published, you and I ought not listen to or read them.
269	Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with corruption in government are that we allow them to be bought with their own personal desires and selfishness. If we do not allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. For example, if a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he isn't in it for the money, but for the actual job. I know chances of this being implemented are slim, don't use that as an argument.
270	I come from a family that was involved, and to some extent still is, with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland, and that they wanted to be part of Northern Ireland was blatantly false. The Republic of Ireland has existed more or less since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers. I also think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason.
271	Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good for: * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last * High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good I'm not sure what the best way to implement it is, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My view is that something like this *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
272	I'll start off by saying that I am a man myself and I consider myself an egalitarian, a humanitarian, and a socialist. I don't like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views is that they are simply female supremacists anymore. However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same. I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (men being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however, it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about them. However, that's just my opinion. Feel free to change it!
273	Misinformed voting is a problem, and I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they voted.
274	You know these cars with "systems." You hear the bass booming from hundreds of feet away, and the vibrations shake your floors. If you can make out the music, it's usually terrible techno or hip-hop. These systems serve no purpose to the driver or the roads that they utilize. From a safety standpoint, the sound is a clear distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren, or passing car horn. From a quality of life standpoint, it's pure noise pollution, and a sign of pure inconsideration when a driver refuses to keep it down late at night. I feel the DMV should be performing a decibel check on all car audio systems, and they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal. Reject their inspection, and impound them if discovered on the road.
275	I understand that religion can be good because it teaches good morals, encourages people to help others, etc. I also understand that many conflicts have started because of religion or have revolved around religion, for example WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason I think this is because of how other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple whatever) are always asking for money. Censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc. Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion. Suicide bombers
276	To clarify, I do not believe the world's climate is static and unchanging, I simply do not think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be very interested in the scientific side of it, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
277	I was reading a post today about the supposed malaria vaccine and realized that while it is terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness, it will ultimately result in an increase in world population. Every new development in sickness prevention or life elongation contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this earth.
278	I have played the game and completed it, and I do not understand why it is so popular. The gameplay is very linear, and the story is very good, but the rest of the game is very bland.
279	All of these methods of killing result in long and painful deaths. Why is one acceptable while the other is not? Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and does not spread to other areas such as civilian areas.
280	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of a historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
281	Here are some points to counter or address: 1. Putting a large amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!
282	It is a lottery - luck of the draw. It will decide a winner, to be sure, but the better team doesn't always win. And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce, but they are a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.
283	I was born just early enough to completely miss the Pokemon craze. Being on Reddit, I see how it's become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I've never had any contact with the cards or games. I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look really bad. The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding. CMV that Pokemon games are aimed at kids and there's no point to trying them for the first time as an adult.
284	I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter, yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation. I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights. And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
285	I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance and want their voices heard, but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
286	I have attended or seen pictures of family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I am not talking about a simple gathering; I mean full out cap and gown, commencement speeches, hours long, etc. full on graduation ceremonies. I feel that celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes that walk across the stage for the student when they earn their diploma or degree.
287	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mount Sinai. Since it says that amount left Egypt in the bible, we can safely assume there were over a million people gathered. Now, even back then in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all of their ancestors were at Mount Sinai and God spoke to them is an insane task. It would be EXTREMELY difficult to fake something like that and get a whole nation to believe it. Therefore, I believe that the national revelation proof makes Judaism the most believable religion. Islam and Christianity rely on the same proof and another leap of faith, therefore they are clearly less believable.
288	This was spurred by a discussion between my girlfriend and myself the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, my own being the one presented.
289	Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for people who don't know what beer is. Yuengling is mass produced and actually pretty good. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just awful enough to please the unwashed plebs.
290	The average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would more benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
291	Anything intelligent created by a more intelligent being is artificial, correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while its creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can God love me or you?
292	I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came by their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people have come by significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring 'illegal alien' workers who work for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they'd be required to pay minimum wage (Wal-Mart has been found guilty of this several times over the past years especially in hiring their janitorial staffs), by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any rich person who has come by money through dishonest means...I'd say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
293	Before I begin, let's create three basic ideas about God: A. God is perfect B. God sees all C. God can do whatever he wants. Now, based on those, we can create the following: 1. God sees evil in the world (B). But, despite having the power to stop it (C), He does not. 2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect. 4. Therefore, God doesn't exist.
294	Rowing is definitely more intense. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for a long period of time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument, however, assumes that a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner, for example, but may have insane upper body strength, and vice versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.
295	I believe environmentalism is a good thing, but recently I think it could be categorized as a cult. They obviously have some great views and do help the planet, but the thing that bothers me is "global warming". I think there is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun, not our production of carbon dioxide. These radical environmentalists are literally attempting to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientific evidence against global warming, they persist. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow America's economy.
296	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion. Sometimes his opinion seems moderately justified, sometimes not. Similarly, someone like Keith Olberman also has opinions which are sometimes moderately justified, sometimes not. Each can wield structured argumentation, and each will occasionally resort to more base forms of persuasion. It's all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.
297	I agree that academic qualifications ensure success in life because academic qualifications ensure you have the basics of learning. If your basic grounding in maths, science, and languages is strong, you can achieve success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, innovate, and communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
298	A recession isn't always bad. An optimistic view of this recession is that all of the corporate world fat is being trimmed and weeded out, leaving only the best and most sufficient companies. The short term job losses and price increases are definitely a bad thing, but they are only temporary. The US has gotten out of worse before (late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression).
299	The present day crisis was brought on by the automobile, petroleum, rubber, and construction companies after World War II. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists developing solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuel while destroying the environment. This is simply a case of the chickens coming home to roost.
300	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway). Personally, I would also suggest a restriction on how far a newly licensed driver can travel on thier own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on their first motorway jaunt.
301	Monarchies are burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchy because they don't have the original role - ruling. There are many examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizens. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pounds per year.
302	You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would surprise you. Examples include crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc. In the deepest part of each person, there is something that is eventually revealed to the world that you did not know or knew about prior. Because of that, you can never truly know what makes a person tick.
303	"Nothing exists." To utter that sentence, or even contemplate it, applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet, to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, nothing exists.
304	In this case, I do not believe that the Phelps Clan is protected by the First Amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one person's funeral. At that point, it's almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Now, had they been somewhere else and been stating their beliefs against all military members or gay people, then they would have been fine. But to single out one person in particular and hold signs up saying "Semper Fi fag" and "Thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the First Amendment.
305	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while trying to be funny she said that "her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics." The article caused quite a bit of controversy. This has to be one of the meanest things she has ever said. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense some times, but you can clearly tell that she is making fun of mentally disabled people here. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it's one of the worst things she has ever said...what do you guys think?
306	At 82 years old, especially in the 1940's, it may have been natural causes. I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have killed him a lot earlier when he was actually inventing things which could possibly be related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more likely to be a conspiracy theorist's probability.
307	I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be small, but there was enough meat in them that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. The iced tea was fresh, the restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies, etc. I could've taken pictures to show how much meat was in the tacos, but instead, I ate them.
308	Relaxing place to be, nice terrace and good variety menu, but only accept cash. Last time I was there the ATM didn't work either. They should at least have debit...or Apple Pay. Other then that, order at the counter and food is delivered to your table. Would go back for a coffee break.
309	The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to eat, but it is not very inventive.
310	The first time I visited this location, I ordered a latte and it was great. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were nice. The second time I visited, I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the woman scrubbing her bottom through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it at this point. I didn't plan on eating anything but politely waited...and waited...and waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait. It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top. Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.
311	The ambiance was good, very 60's Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto which was bland and did not taste any herbs or olive oil. I'm not sure how that is possible. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. Salad was brown and the house Italian tasted like stale parm. Portions were lame for the price. Usually you can count on a $14 gnocchi to be pretty hearty - this one would be a'small plate' at most Italian joints. A very unimpressive $60 meal for the two of us. I'll be returning in the summer to check out "the most romantic patio in Cleveland," hoping another dish will be worth it.
312	Our waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I was very disappointed in the food.
313	I will admit that the food is inconsistent sometimes but that is not always the case. The sandwich selection is good, the veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Deliver to get the Smallman Street Deli. Everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately). I will keep patronizing this delicious place.
314	I think we should not wear school clothes because they are weird, and a good reason is that bullying is less common. Also, they are stupid and gay.
315	Is this being argued? The only reason to use IE is that Windows has it pre-installed, and from what I've heard, they're going to get rid of that too. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.
316	Mozilla Firefox can be used for everything! There are also plugins so that you can use the Internet Explorer engine in the Firefox shell. It has many more plugins and the themes are a nice feature. All of the innovations in E 7.0 were in Firefox years ago.
317	If my husband committed murder, I would not turn him in. I know he must have had a good reason to do it. People make mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that in love we should be by our partners through thick and thin, no matter what. I would not want my husband to be in jail.
318	No, I would not turn in my spouse, because when you get married you promise to be there for each other through good times and bad, and I would do anything to help her. However, don't misunderstand me; if my spouse were to get caught, I would not go down with her, because, most likely, I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
319	Probably not, because of the love that holds us together. But, on the flip side, if it was murder, I would turn them in.
320	I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit in front of it, it has been proven to cause violence, and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someone's imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. I am not completely against TV, but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people.
321	We are aware that India is fully filled with corruption. Each and every person has no time to help others; his only aim is to earn money in any way. Our manners and civilization are deteriorating every day.
322	India will never lead the world if no one can understand what they are saying because of their awful accent.
323	I don't think, even as an Indian citizen, that the GDP of India will increase in the next five years. They don't even have enough funds to feed all the poor. How can we imagine them leading the world?
324	It is really difficult not to have a male role model when you are growing up. However, I believe being fatherless is better than having a bad father. The reason is that you do not want to look up to a man who does nothing in life and is setting bad examples. Perhaps you will grow up following his steps. Therefore, being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on yourself without the need for a father being there. Additionally, there are always other people by your side helping you get through life.
325	I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a bad father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very bad. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and I haven't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disappointment. So I think that being fatherless is much better.
326	I'd rather be fatherless than have a bad father. Having a bad father who tire to tell me what to do but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. I'd rather be raised by my mom, who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works every day to make money to put food on the table.
327	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people. Whereas Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
328	Porn is wrong because you are lustful. It's even worse when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which is cheating. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
329	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there is massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
330	That is your best argument - "Because they don't"?? I thought there was a reason for everything... I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. How does an animal acquire a trait that it wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties." I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change. By the way, I'm just wondering, because I'm a curious person... what insects are you talking about?
331	Since then, Internet Explorer has been around and is already installed on most computers. It is universal! Firefox, however, needs to be downloaded or installed.
332	In my opinion, physical education classes should be mandatory in schools, because they offer children a bit of exercise. If all schools had physical education classes, there would be much fewer overweight children. Of course, health classes should also be mandatory, so children learn how to eat well and become less obese.
333	Yes! And yes! And yes! And yes!
334	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
335	He invited immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and set up an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.
336	Raffles does not care about the citizens, does not spare a thought at all. So what if he discovered the island of Majulah Singapore? He did not help in the least in Singapore's development. Why should he be called Singapore's founder? Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
337	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles.
338	Farquar resolved many problems, such as the rat and centipede infestation. It took only a few days for Farquar to completely eradicate the infestation, whereas Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
339	A common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" There is a simple counter to this: what if this person who gets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
340	Life has existed for billions of years, so any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying.
341	If you can, please provide us with your facts. Do you have brain scans of the first humans? How about average organ sizes, hair patterns, facial characteristics, heart rate records? Speaking of these factors, how do you sabrejimmy account for the different racial characteristics of modern humans? I'm married to a Japanese woman. Why do we look so different? Was there in fact an Asian Garden of Eden? And an African Garden of Eden? And a... What do you actually believe anyhow?
342	I just don't understand why it matters so much. We are here, so go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to persuade the opponent to your side, but I just don't see why even debating it is necessary.
343	I have to disagree with phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur. When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
344	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing, all-powerful, loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
345	I find it interesting that there are currently seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing (or able?) to give a reason why.
346	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it isn't wrong, it's genius.
347	Pornography is not wrong, because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Pornography teaches, and gives prime examples.
348	The ability to do both would be amazing, but if I had to choose, I would rather help others in any way I can. Even a small thing can make a difference in someone's life, like being a friend or helping them to get their needs met.
349	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First of all, they make students look nice and tidy. Second, we can know who is studying at which school or who is in the same school as us. And lastly, it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
350	I'd rather have a bad father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the best things that could happen to you. At least a bad father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father for anything. I think bad fathers are like that because they love their child, and want their son or daughter to be as perfect as possible.
351	I think it's better to have a bad father than be fatherless; maybe having one isn't that bad, other than living with the idea that you don't have one, or having doubts about how good it would be to have one.
352	I think it is better to have a bad father than no father at all. You can count on your father to be there for you in good times and bad. If you don't have a father, you don't really know what is right or wrong. You don't have anyone to talk to or confide your problems with.
353	I would rather have a bad father than no father at all. There will be a point where you need his help. (It may not help, but at least you tried.) I know that I have a bad father, and there are times when he makes me mad, but then there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I do not have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how bad he is.
354	I feel that it is better to have a bad father than not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means that one day they may be good at it. If you are fatherless, there is not even a chance of having a good father. So, having a bad father would be better.
355	Estimates vary widely, but the worldwide bottled water sales are between $50 and $100 billion per year, with the market expanding at a startling annual rate of 7%. Water is a big business, but it is not sustainable.
356	TV, because only TV can bring you live news, and books that you cannot find anywhere else. It's also educational.
357	You can download the "Foxtel Go" app to your iPad, so you can watch TV where ever and whenever you want.
358	You can just sit on the couch with some chips, a burger, or candy and watch TV when you don't want to do anything.
359	The water bottles are a safe source of water and are guaranteed to be safe.
360	Bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly distribute bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storage of water. Also, contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
361	It is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused!
362	If bottled water did not exist, people would drink more sweetened liquids because it would be the only portable drink. People would become fat!
363	Two men and women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas, the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God, and the words are taken from the Bible, but it is obvious that God does not approve of this.
364	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, it looks like chasbas' argument which I rebutted on Feb 07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
365	Guys and girls were made for a reason. This reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so that they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites attract everywhere. Besides, it just doesn't work with two guys (genitals). That's why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.
366	Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married politically, no tax deductions, no married filing jointly, nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government completely out of the picture. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality, let them, it's them that are going against their religion. I don't support it. As I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church does not support it. It irks me that people who claim to be Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
367	It is unnatural, because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
368	Of course it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict. It just doesn't work. To "lead" a country must have time and resources to worry about other countries and not itself.
369	India and China could redefine what a third world country means, because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
370	As humans, we cannot know for sure if there is a higher force or not. Christianity, however, is not it. First of all, it is not one belief that every Christian shares. It lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with many different side roads. Ask a question about religion, and many people will find one of those side roads to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. Atheism, on the other hand, has a clearer concept. It is more scientific, and I like that.
371	This is my biggest problem with Christianity: why is it about belief? There have been horrible people who are believers. What about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is? I AM an atheist and I am a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is preposterous.
372	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are Christian or atheism. Shouldn't it be "theism or atheism or other"?
373	Sometimes that's all a child needs to behave well. All those "no"s, "stops," "don't do that," just don't work.
374	I agree that they must understand they were wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that, they will learn not to do it again.
375	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, while a religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. Although I'm a religious person, I think atheists can stand to hear because everyone is independent and everyone has to have their own opinion.
376	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline their children. It only makes the child angry, rather than seeing what they did wrong.
377	No, because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life, and also, it could make other parents think that hitting their kids is okay.
378	I would report them, whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense, they would most likely get away with it, but if it was an act of rage, I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me, and I could not live knowing that there is a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.
379	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder, whether it was by accident or on purpose. If it was by accident, then the police will determine that. For example, what if your spouse murdered yours? Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life there is more to worry about than yourself.
380	I put my argument on the side of "yes," but in reality, it really depends on my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather he kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason, I probably would turn him in. Love may be strong, but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer, because what if one day he decided to kill me?
381	Actually, the government does limit what a woman can do with her body. For example, it is illegal to commit suicide. If a person is caught trying to cut themselves into pieces, they could be placed in a mental institute.
382	No matter what circumstance a woman is in, she got pregnant. When rape occurs, why is it the innocent baby that gets no choice and dies? The mother isn't to be blamed, but she has become selfish with her body. She believes she has the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because she feels like it and made a mistake.
383	What we are dealing with is indirect murder. If a woman decides to abort a child, she has killed a life that could have been a big contribution to society.
384	While I agree that physical education should be required in high school, I would suggest that it not be mandatory for all four years of high school. Perhaps, just having PE be an optional class and having one year be mandatory. In lower grades, it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in strange patterns. That Is All.
385	It is expensive, embarrassing for some, and unfair for AP students that aren't in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
386	I don't understand how anyone can say that gay marriage is wrong. It is a personal choice, and one should be able to enjoy all of the benefits that heterosexual couples do.
387	I am an agnostic, so my religion does not conflict with this matter. I am an avid supporter of gay marriage.
388	Helping others for the common good can make you feel proud, but you need the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means, you first have to have a personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other, but you first have to have a personal pursuit before you can have a common good. However, for some people, their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
389	There is no provision in either document you cite that says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom. Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation. We never have been. You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
390	It sounds to me like you have big trouble. CASA is Community Alternate Systems Agency, which is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.), they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
391	The official reason is that they make an 'orderly market.' They must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. It is also true that they make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I don't agree with them or with this policy, but that's what is happening.
392	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the two of you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can't work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on your ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
393	The CIA leak was far worse. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, and possibly the security of our country, was put in jeopardy. Clinton's infidelity directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, but was no skin off the noses of everyone else. One reason why the media devoted less attention to Plamegate is that the corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
394	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are many children who need to go into foster care and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal, then there will be a lot of women dying from having abortions in not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think that when a person says they are pro life, they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that have been abandoned by mothers who did not want or couldn't take care of them.
395	Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications. However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money. Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock. The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
396	This guy has a point. I'm not sure about the specifics of any Yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Incidents may have dwindled in recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
397	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then I say you should sue for compensation. Money will not change what those evil bastards put you through, but if you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness, then why not. I hope everything goes your way. You deserve it, your family deserves it.
398	Probably not. Not many people work for free unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc). You MIGHT get someone to take the case on fee, which is to say they'd get a percentage of the verdict. This will only work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training; I don't generally give work out for free unless there's a damn good reason. And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
399	I'm trying not to get tangled up in that, but one thing I have noticed is his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy, right? Problem is, I don't think he uses them. I almost think he just wings the whole damn thing, but who knows. I don't see a problem with speech writers, to be honest, if your a president of a company, or of a nation, what you say will effect many people. Hiring someone who is skilled in speeches and public policy is not only rational, but almost the only choice to properly convey the message you want everyone to hear. If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official "answers" to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
400	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness". That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to the age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw the line?
401	The difference between the two is more like dolphins and porpoises, not Lions and Bats. The reason one is legal and the other is not, is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts is hard to understand. For example, it is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have a film of two other people having sex for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with. The bottom line is they could make prostitution legal, they chose not to.
402	In fact, you have it wrong. The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind throughout history so far. It is far from perfect, it is flawed, but it is human. It is still the best we have come up with so far. No matter what the media may claim and promote, it is getting better all the time, not worse. Because people do better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our children.
403	You might be able to. Here is what I would do. First, gather all your receipts. If you do not have the actual receipts... well... you scewed and might as well stop here. However, there is the possibility that the old pharmacy has your prescriptions on file and they may be able to provide you with a print out of your purchases. Second, I really do not think the pharmacy will be willing to reimburse you... but the insurance company might. Copy all the receipts, write a letter and fill out your insurance companies claim form. Send it all in and cross your fingers. Good luck!
404	You shouldn't expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case. It would take an attorney a considerable amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details. This is one of those situations where Y!A isn't going to be very helpful to you.
405	You have been warned and should not plead for lenience because you were caught smoking marijuana. The third strike is for more than marijuana. He or she committed other crimes that were not caught. We are safer without them on the street.
406	Yes, if it's his baby. They're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and, if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. Why assume the man left? She didn't say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
407	You signed a contract knowing you would not abide by it? The answer is yes. The property management company can place restrictions in the lease. Depending upon how the lease reads exactly, the key to this restriction is the word "loaded". Meaning you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby - It will be hard to prove either way.
408	Unfortunately, no you cannot reopen such a case, not without new evidence. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help much. A very valuable lesson is to be learned here- you were so young when it happened- your body had many changes to go through yet, and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
409	If you do it in good faith, it is fine. However, if you do it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language, which was your only real purpose in coming up with a new language in the first place, then it will not help you, and you will be convicted of "making terroristic threats".
410	I think it should be deemed as hear say and thrown out immediately. It is inadmissible evidence. They cannot accept this as a confession because first, his low IQ made him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered and the wording and thought process are to complex for this defendant. He is to incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
411	Since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it. The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note. Otherwise, she's stuck. And no, he won't get off scott free either. They can take his tax return to pay on it. She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
412	I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority children.
413	That is not the case. It is a Hollywood thing. I have been to court many times, only to observe, not as a witness or anything, and I have never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That is all.
414	Are you sure that you are reporting the information correctly? If you parked your car on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may give them the right to enforce this policy. Regardless of what you feel about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employee unless you belong to a union. I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy. You have two choices: stop smoking, or go off the property to smoke.
415	It is still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, whether he is an idiot or not.
416	Doctor, be very careful with this. I'm a writer and an ex police officer. These people will have you surgically removing their boots from your own...Send an official certified letter to the original publisher of the material along with a permission form to use their content. And, if they don't get back to you, extract the info from another source. Protect yourself my friend. Their lawyers will eat your lunch and not even leave you a Twinkie! Also, a disclaimer on your site is still a good idea.
417	Because they haven't thought through it properly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view. Also, note opinions on the death penalty. It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.
418	I completely agree with you. While some may argue that this is barbaric and inhumane, it is also true that some perverts who have raped and killed a child still have human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog, why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country? The justice system in Britain at the moment is hopeless. Far too many people are getting away with all sorts and something needs to be done!
419	You admitted fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too. Read what you wrote and you will realize that you have no argument in court. He did not write the ticket for not stopping for the stop sign. He wrote the ticket for "failing to yield to oncoming traffic at a stop sign." A big difference, if you were struck by cross traffic it becomes obvious that you did not yield to their right of way! Your best bet would be to plead "no contest," accepting the courts verdict without admitting guilt, it keeps you from looking foolish by trying to argue an open and closed case, and save face at the same time.
420	I try to teach my children to treat others as I would like them to treat me. As far as I'm concerned, two negatives only make a positive in math. Therefore, torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable. Those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured.
421	That is exactly what I want. A felon with a firearm. Do not break the law, and you will not lose your rights. I hope that nobody like you will not succeed in changing the law that our law-abiding forefathers fought for. I am a law-abiding citizen, and guess what? I have a license to carry a gun for protection. I was able to get the license because I am not a felon, and I earned the right.
422	Emergency Petitons for psychiatric evaluations are not an arrest.. nor are they available for review by an employer.. the American Disabilities Act prevents this.. and gives you ground for a law suit if it is used against you.. you do need to make your employer aware of your condition.. if he fires you... you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you didnt make them aware of your illness prior to employment.. after the ADA reviews this... you will be given a "right to sue" letter.. (whether the ADA find validity in your claim or not-- you still have to go through this) only after the proceedings with the ADA can you get a lawyer involved... he will argue that you didnt make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place.. many lawyers work probono and have a field day with employers like these.. bottom line... mental illnesses such as bipolar are a disabilty... furthermore... you may also be eligible for Social Security... so you dont have to put up with narrowminded employers.
423	Well, it would have been nice had you used spell check first... Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English... So my answer to this is, which marriage were you speaking of??? I am on marriage number 3 and at my age it would be foolish to act like a virgin this far into my life... I know others that are in their 5th marriage; you think they should wait too??? Just exactly how holier are you than the rest of us??? My previous 2 marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault... So we should study that aspect more, don't we?
424	I believe it is usually acceptable to break the law if it would cause bodily harm or death. Additionally, if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate against certain groups, I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court.
425	I would never let anyone know this publicly, hence the post, but I really enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The acting is pretty poor, but it is at least a decent Sci-Fi movie, with a good amount of action. I liked the thought of post-war America, has some shout outs to Fort Hood, Knox, and a couple other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, Travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it is on, I tend to watch it. Just to give a Primer, my five favorite movies of all time (in no particular order) Shawshank, Godfather, Inside Man, Animal House, Goodfellas.
426	First of all, here are definitions from the Oxford Dictionaries: Pornography: "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings." Explicit: "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion." I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating. Some don't even include real descriptions of sex at all. I cannot find a citation right now (on mobile), but I have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.
427	This may be more specific to Canada, but I really do not care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to. I feel that regardless if it's the Liberals, Conservatives, or NDP (read: the parties that could realistically win just about everything), some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and corruption will definitely occur. Additionally, every incumbent cancels out what their predecessors put in place to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle. This is me looking at the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favor of subways and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.
428	Instruments have such extreme limitations compared to normal composition programs that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you can't control the frequencies of the sounds you're making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just a drone, an atomaton playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
429	I have been debating this for months, and I cannot think of a good moral path. I have always thought that killing an animal for food, and not for fun, is morally correct because animals do not understand death, like humans do. They will have a wonderful life in the wild, regardless of whether or not I kill them. As for producing animals for food, I also think this is okay, as long as the animals are treated right and fairly. That's why I'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with unneeded cruelty, or atleast it seems like they do.
430	My reasoning is: -My expected degree is in the scientific field, and a bachelor's isn't very prestigious in that field, as most people get their PhD. -It is a normal event in life for people who are serious about a future, and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising. -I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing. -The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as rigorous as could be, and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.
431	After a marriage ends, unless a prenup was signed, one partner usually receives alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive it. If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid, I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job. CMV!
432	I have gone back and listened to a lot of other bands that are in the same league like Pearl Jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden..but no I dont buy the Spiel that Nirvana were 'just another band'.
433	I scroll through Reddit and there are sections of comments that I cannot understand. People talking about spaghetti and Transformers movies? Karma is flowing freely and no original thought has been had.
434	As an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with based on historical and present discrimination- but it seems like wherever it's used outside sociological theory it's mostly an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.
435	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are hunters more morally and ecologically irresponsible than poachers? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, like poachers, threaten animals for the sake of profit. Anti-poaching initiatives are hypocrisy in themselves. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.
436	The realism in games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield mirror that of the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people how to shoot others. Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media seems illogical to me. In WW2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting their guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure.
437	I know this sounds awful, but donating free rice to a third world country is not a good idea. Although it seems like a good idea at the start, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people, any form of farming or other food production in that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donation is made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries, which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
438	I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one: smarts. If you're smart, you can be wheelchair-bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. For example: Stephen Hawking. He has almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life.
439	I believe that no one should be allowed to be a permanent member and that the 5 countries with the largest influence on the world (defined by a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records). Countries who fall far enough in any of those will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats they would be filled as they currently are....as for veto power I believe that it is overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea...I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue I understand that this is 2 part, but they go together so I thought it should be ok to put them in 1 CMV
440	This isn't referring to depression caused by a terminal illness, but specifically about clinical depression prompting suicidal urges for years. Decades even. I don't view suicide as a choice. It's a fight or flight response. Some people cope, others don't. Also, my philosophy on the value of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated, but at a certain point it becomes so chronic that pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family they are literally tortured into accepting life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully.
441	I do not want to come across as if I'm speaking ill of the dead. I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why: She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?
442	I was raised by my patriotic parents to despise Margaret Thatcher. In the early 80's she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. But recently, to my disbelief, I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader. She is also referenced as "The Iron Lady". I cannot stand this woman and how anyone can respect her is beyond me.
443	I watched Drive in the theater when it came out several years ago. Almost all of my friends absolutely love the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: the artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting, etc. Now I do not hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. I thought Gosling's character was very bland, and I felt like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. The other actors were good, Cranston in particular, but nothing award winning. The soundtrack was really good, but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status. All in all, I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere. Viewers who loved it, can you CMV?
444	I am strongly against HFCS because, in short, it kills people. While I understand it is cheaper, it is by no means better. Here are some reasons why I do not like HFCS: 1.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical. Our bodies do not process them the same way. 2.) The corn industry is very corrupt and has caused local farmers to go out of business. 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical. 4.) The corn industry is causing local farmers to go out of business.
445	This happens all the time online and in real life. Someone says something and another person says "that's racist," which is their trump card that they feel immediately discredits the other person's entire argument.
446	They aren't really on the same level. Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga, but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different. FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam. Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to. The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42), and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.
447	Although eBay serves only as a marketplace connecting suppliers and consumers, it is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market... where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In otherwords, this is a self-targeting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency. Amazon, on the other hand, used to use consumer price-targeting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targeting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency.
448	Final Fantasy is better because compared to Kingdom Hearts, it has better graphics and a better story line. I admit Kingdom Hearts has some good features, but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodies called nobodys. And the biggest ruiner is that you do it all with a key. Plus some Final Fantasy games are turn based, which I find to be a little better. The Final Fantasy Trilogy has been out since the NES, and I have played the first one many times, so I can honestly say that not only has Final Fantasy been out longer and had a better run than most games, but you cannot beat the rating of 7 on any game. Also, in Kingdom Hearts 2, you can see tipha, sephiroth, and cloud, but with different names like roxas is the kid form of cloud. I rest my case.
449	Arguments about the existence of God are useless. There have been logical arguments presented, but they can be disproven using more logic. This can be reffered to David Hume's "Matter of Facts." This says that a matter of fact can be presented, but cannot be disproven. There are no concrete arguments that can be presented to prove or disprove his existence, thus making it useless to debate about his existence or not. It all comes down to faith.
450	Global warming is an issue that affects the whole world, hence the global bit. America seems to pride itself on being a country with no qualms about rushing into another country to'save' and 'liberate' it from evil forces (even if the rest of the world dosen't always agree). If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its wieght on the global warming problem. As one of the largest C02 producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the 'Last World Superpower' will cut down on its catastrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
451	The points against torture are numerous, but the most important one is IT DOESN'T WORK. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24." That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren't we supposed to be the good guys? How do we expect to keep our supposed moral superiority when we debase ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue that we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in the war on terror, shouldn't we have rounded up all the German-Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
452	Two reasons: - Let all babies be wanted. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be emotionally devastating to some. - Anyone who does not want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.
453	The poor need help! The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. Having poor people exploited is bad for society. No health care, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution. This does not mean taxing people 20%; rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
454	I have just watched the original debate in the Houses of Parliament on TV, about Tony Blair's legacy, and it made me wonder about this. I have to say that I think if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution, the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
455	Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. No longer is it the loud smoke chugging brute of an engine. Rather, it now has mileage that rivals hybrids and has more eco-friendly emissions than ever before. It is not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however until we get more efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point. (also, hydrogen as a combustive fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible as well)
456	I did not create this debate, and yes, I will be standing up for Rugby. Here are my reasons: 1) Rugby is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. And they run a lot. Like constantly, coupled with constant attack and defense, with no time-outs and no dead plays. 2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors. 3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Sport in the raw.
457	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits. Keep in mind that being a stimulant and tasting good are not medical benefits either. On the other hand, marijuana's active ingredient THC has been used for many health benefits, moreover the stalk, leaves, and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothing, and other materials as well. No Contest! Marijuana ranks high above coffee.
458	I disagree. You are, in effect, forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Instead, set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants, and I'd be interested. Provide tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who've contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.
459	College athletes do get paid. Going to college costs money, and if they are good enough and maintain a GPA, they receive scholarships which are debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1,000 and using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1,000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school, the answer is automatically no.
460	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer, and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
461	Just like any private school, religious schools earn money from their own pupils. This money goes directly to them, unlike public schools who have to use community fundraisers and events. The money given to private schools like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity... you do not know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.
462	I do not understand how cutting someone's hair, like a child, would straighten them out. For most kids, it wouldn't really teach them a "valuable" lesson. I can tell you based on personal experience. If you can properly discipline your child, then there is no reason to cut his/her hair as a punishment. If it does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did was wrong.
463	Criminal gangs are criminal gangs, regardless of who they are made up of. If the police are not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, ordinary citizens will take up arms to protect themselves. While it is understandable, this is not good for the rule of law. Therefore, 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and keeping the public safe.
464	I was very disappointed in this place. I have been going to a ramen place down the street for some time and always leave full and happy. I came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasn't happy. I would pick ramen over pho any day!
465	This place is pretty darn ghetto. They had to break up a fight around 11pm and there were only about 25 people here. I'm also looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at a table, and it doesn't seem like it's from alcohol if you ask me. Server was alright. They were out of three types of tacos as well as sour cream, which is pretty strange for a Friday night. Service was a little slow for a weekend night. We had a good time due to the company we were with, but we probably won't be coming back for the next girls night.
466	My family and I have always ordered from this location for over ten years. Our house number ends in 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell phone. Recently, the employees have shown poor customer service skills and have hung up on me when I attempt to call back. Two months ago, they messed up our order and whoever was the manager must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. This is about the fourth time the employees have shown poor customer service and have hung up on me. We decided to go with Papa John's for at least their employees are professionals and friendly. I hope they close this store because you never know if or what they would put in our pizza!!!!
467	Usually we have a good experience here, but this last visit was not so good. The food was fine, but the service was not very good. The server took our drink orders first, and then our dinner orders at the same time. That was the case here. Perhaps the staffing was not sufficient.
468	I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients are very fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata. My go to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or their Chicken Chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them! I always forget to go in and take advantage of that, but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. If you want to spend a dime for great food, this is your place.
469	The bartender was rude and immature. She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her for drinks. There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why! We asked for chips and salsa. She said they only had nachos. We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us. So...hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her. She told me I was being confrontational. I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes. We will never go there again.
470	We just went over for drinks. My friend had the Mac & Cheeze and said it was really good. She even got some wings to go because her man loves them. The outdoor seating was really chill, although that day they allowed some kids to come in and they were definitely obnoxious. Other than that, I think it's a really cool and chill place to hang and drink.
471	The last thing that a school ought to do is attempt to hinder the creative expression - the individuality - of their still-developing children.
472	It does not show children's expressions and uniforms do not show, is that correct?
473	I would like to bring attention to the issue of wearing school uniforms by high school students. It does not make any sense, in fact, it is the opposite. It simply creates trouble between students and teachers. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become a very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior? It must be done in childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
474	Uniforms are terrible. Wearing uniforms does not mean better learning at school. Students go to school to learn, not waste money on uniforms.
475	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across are on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix). And arguing for IE7 in favor of Firefox... Weakness. For every feature they added to IE 7 they removed one of the advantages earlier versions had. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs em!)
476	There is no reason for anyone to say IE is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
477	Of course not! Absolutely not! It's something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she will definitely learn from. She was brave enough to tell me about it, something not many people would do. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not told anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!
478	If my husband killed someone, I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite. I would help him hide any evidence, if any, I would move if we needed to, and I would never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there, or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.
479	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books have terrible arguments? Like that person who just said TV is awesome in all capitals and with exclamation marks. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it rots the brain.
480	First of all, India does not have the potential to "rule" the world. Have you seen the people? Good Indians with good minds are in foreign countries getting Nobel prizes while the others are just stuck ups who do nothing and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!
481	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
482	This argument could be argued, but I would have to agree that being fatherless is better, because in my opinion a bad father is one who is never there when you need him. And he never listens to what you have to say.
483	I think both being fatherless and having a bad father is depressing. But, for me, I would prefer to be fatherless. At least I know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if I had a bad father and he did not care about me. In this case, I have a father but he is not here in this country. I understand that he left back to his country for a good reason. But I still need him here to support me.
484	When Raffles came back after a period of time, he changed rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This shows that he cared for the people.
485	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas, and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence, it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
486	The definition of founder is not a person who "discovers" a place. For example, the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore. I know Farquhar was very involved in this help and sometimes even did all the work, but let me remind you that, as raffles' "assistant", he still had to consult raffles, and raffles had all authority over Singapore, therefore he was given credit.
487	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts tend to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women negatively. Also, people who are addicted to porn expect all women to look and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about. It tends to screw up their reality.
488	I become suicidal when I think about the one I love most having relations with other women.
489	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's an example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s, and when it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
490	If you believe in "The Big Bang," that's fine; but what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be; the point is that it cannot have just appeared.
491	What I meant was that in the situation, both moths were present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees to begin with... "Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution." Who selects this mutation to occur? Does it just happen by good fortune?
492	In the twenty-first century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution with more responsibility placed on mankind.
493	Could a higher power that cannot be proven have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when it is really only 1 hundred thousand years old?
494	Spam and adware seem to be more compatible with Internet Explorer.
495	I feel that Physical Education should be mandatory because people need their exercise. If they do not get physical activity, they will accumulate fat and become chubby. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical Education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I do not want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving!
496	Of course phys ed must be taught, but it mustn't be compulsory because some of us are not fit to do the extensive exercises performed.
497	This will help kids learn good qualities like leadership and discipline. It could also lead to help childhood obesity.
498	Definately all those obese kids need exercise, and it's a whole part of life. Of course, it should be mandatory.
499	I agree with everything she said because children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so fewer people in our country are less likely to be obese.
500	Yes! Our kids are mostly out of shape and eat too much junk food.
501	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar so I believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
502	I like to think both are true. First, God created the first things (I don't think Adam and Eve were really human, maybe single celled, but man had a hard time believing that, so we made the first creatures man). Second, those things God created evolved to fit their surroundings. (There is proof of this, you can not deny this. I do not know if we came from monkeys or not.)
503	There is no God. I only use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments.
504	Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old "watchmaker" argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," but equally well written.
505	I am annoyed by all the arguments about how pornography leads to addiction. I think that it is only a problem for weak people. I watch pornography once or twice a day when I am alone, but I have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if I'm lucky!) times a week. We use pornography to spice things up in the bedroom, but we know it is all fantasy. We're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
506	I am a woman who watches porn, and it does not bother me if my boyfriend watches it. I think it is natural for people to have sexual desires. If people are uncomfortable with the idea, just do not watch it. However, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want, and I see no wrong with that.
507	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do, I feel great knowing that I am helping the community. In a personal sense, when you do something for the good of others, you are helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves, where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
508	While striving to make advancements for the common good, you can change the world forever. Many people have succeeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr., and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good, and they were honored for it.
509	Simply written Seeking to advance the common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey or series of considerate acts one can have an easier time pursuing a personal goal or lifestyle. The word for this debate is "sacrifice." How much would a person really "sacrifice" for their neighbor without being blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? No matter where a person is in their life... Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
510	They teach people about the clothes they may have to wear later in life, and they make sure that no inappropriate clothing is worn.
511	I try to see things objectively, but sometimes I'd rather have a fatherless father than a good one, because growing up and being ready for life requires that you learn about life, and if you don't have a good or bad role model to look up to, life may become more difficult or less enjoyable.
512	It is better to have a bad father than none at all. Even if you have a bad father, you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better." Even if you have a bad father, he will love you no matter what.
513	I would not live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had a lousy father, even if he had no job or life and maybe even an alcohol problem. Having a father means so much, especially if you're a boy. Most fathers are friends, so you can talk to them about your problems and they will understand the situation, while if you only live with your mother, you can't because she's a woman and her views are different then a man. Whether your father is good or bad, he will always be there for you at some point in your life.
514	With our water bottle consumption on the planet earth, we could cover all of Mexico three times. That would be a lot of "rich" in their minds Mexicans.
515	Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks. That works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon. So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?
516	TV is better because you can explore the world while sitting on the couch.
517	I learned English by watching TV. Technically, I learned English by talking with native speakers, but TV helped me understand it much more than books.
518	It improves the academic skills of a child. Television has made children enthusiastic and confident. As a result, children improve their academics and increase their ideas and innovations.
519	Bottled water consumption has grown exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years. This growth has taken place globally, but particularly in Europe and North America. The bottled water industry has literally created its own water culture, which is good for American industries.
520	Nevertheless, bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume large amounts of water and energy in their production processes, which causes their ecological impact to be far more detrimental than that of bottled water.
521	I believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
522	To say India can't lead the world is to say a newborn child can never walk. I agree there are many problems that the rising India is facing today, but we are improving day by day.
523	Hi everyone, this is a new person joining the pro-Indian side of this argument. Those who are against it, please consider this: the wealth that the foreigners are enjoying now was looted from India. The other foreign countries are more developed than us because it is the Indian people who are using their brains and making the other countries develop.
524	Yes, India has the potential to lead the world. Therefore, many countries depend on scientists. In fact, most employees in every country are Indians.
525	Religious people always use the same argument: you can't prove he doesn't exist! You CANNOT disprove a negative! Meaning, you can't prove something isn't there, which is already not there.
526	God is not real, so stop believing in God.
527	I think spanking should be an option. However, I believe it should only be an option after other options have been exhausted.
528	I believe that spanking your child is good because it shows them that what they did was wrong, and if they don't want the feeling of a butt wobble, then they won't make the same mistake twice.
529	I have a personal relationship with Christ. I do believe.
530	Christianity, of course. I cannot imagine a life if I did not believe in God. In fact, I can. It would be hell.
531	This is wrong. We should not insult who we believe in. We do not need to know what you think.
532	This is the most idiotic debate I have ever seen. How can you tell me how we got so perfect, the earth, sun, and moon are in the correct spot, our bodies function perfectly, our hands are made distinctively? Because we were made after God's own image.
533	People should not hit their kids because the kids will think it is okay to hit someone else back. For example, at school, they will end up fighting and being abusive to others.
534	No, because children do not always need to be spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.
535	Is personhood absolute, or is it determined by position? If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say, a five gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so dramatically just because the child is inside the womb?
536	I choose life. Keeping the law against abortion is as murdering your own unborn human child.
537	No. Physical education has been around for over 200 years. Today, it is barely having an effect, mainly because kids are eating too much junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
538	I have had a personal experience with PE in public school. In my experience, physical education is mandatory every year and involves very little physical activity. I have seen DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
539	I had muscle cramps all over when I was doing intense exercises like a long run. People are all different, some may have longer stamina and are able to go for long distance runs and more intense exercises. On the other hand, people like me have less stamina and are only able to go for shorter distance runs and less intense exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
540	Physical education causes many problems. Also, we shouldn't need Physical Education to graduate from school.
541	In my opinion, a person should be free to do as he or she pleases. In my opinion, gay marriage is wrong, but it does not make a significant difference in society. If you choose to do it, do it. It is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and I do in a way, but that does not mean you should let that influence your thoughts. Life is what you want it to be.
542	I think it all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it.
543	Unfortunately, it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you will always be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes, in a good situation, going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better, but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful. We only live this life once, and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
544	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others, but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others, you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
545	I think that focusing on a personal pursuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there is a day when you will announce to the world that you are going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money. In the end, if you are ever in a position of power and have money, you could truly advance the common good.
546	No one enters into court justly, no one goes to court honestly; they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they think of mischief and bring about iniquity. Therefore justice is far from us. Judgment is turned away backwards, and righteousness stands afar off. Truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
547	CarCraze, you are wrong. What you have there is a legitimate court order for you to appear in court to answer a Motion to Collect a Debt. If it is on court paper and has a case number, call the court to confirm the docket number, and find out when the hearing date is. Yes, they do have that power. Yes, That is the equivalent of a subpoena. If you "just let it ride", as you say, don't be surprised when you open up your paycheck and you find a good chunk of it GONE! What you should do: Seek legal counsel (get a lawyer) and come up with a manageable payment plan that is both satisfactory to your creditor, and workable for you. Do not hesitate - you will regret it.
548	None of us have time, but it is your civic duty to participate now and again. There are specific criteria that will relieve you of jury duty, but you still need to show up and allow the judge to review your petition/request and dismiss you legally. As far as trying to act like a jerk in the courtroom and prejudice your responses, be careful-you can be held in contempt and perjury in a courtroom is very expensive!!
549	Ever since Bush got away with tax payer dollars funding Faith-based Initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear of being painted anti-church, there has been a movement in this country for more religious or power of the church. People don't realize how powerful the Catholic Church is. Do a little research and check out how wealthy they are. It will shock you. There is no way they are going to like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.
550	Australia has no basic human rights under the constitution. We have no Bill of Rights like in America. Any rights we do have are established by the courts. In relation to your issue, contact a women's legal service or a women's shelter for advice about what you should do. The question may be whether he has bashed the baby as well (or is likely to), but I am not a lawyer so I don't know for sure.
551	You will not be able to handle all of the charges in one trial. Theft is criminal, and malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil. The District Attorney will not touch them. If you do not have a lawyer to negotiate with the District Attorney, then your best bet is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself at the criminal trial. If the District Attorney wins, your case may be sunk; but if the District Attorney loses, you will be in a better position to sue the witness whom you believe lied. You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.
552	Bush assumes it will put the US at risk of losing the edge in industrial production. The agreement will put stricter restrictions on emissions from various industries in America. To adhere to the standards, America needs to upgrade a large number of industries.
553	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service (in this case, someone else's broadband connection) without permission, he has committed an offence. I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law has been around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted. Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.
554	nuitsen I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, but it was done in response to the suicide bombers. They certainly do not respect others beliefs and truths. What is the difference? s_s2 You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers when Islam, as we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs...they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq, but I do not see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
555	I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back together with him.
556	It depends on your state. Here in Nebraska the legal majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that require support through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants!
557	The US does not want to steal Iraq's oil. It needs to control the world trade in oil. Basically, require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars. This makes American paper money redeemable for oil. Compliant Arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States. If they're allowed to start selling oil in euros, they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously. That's why Bush went to war with all these countries. To maintain America's control over the oil trade.
558	I do not think that it should be a government choice. It should be the owner of the property choice. I have yet to be somewhere where smoke bothers me because most places are non-smoking. Bars here in Ohio aren't most anyway...and that doesn't bother me at all... maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair, but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinking. This is just a way of people controlling and getting money. One of the issues on the ballot, if you read closely, says money for the "clean air fund." If they ban smoking, why would you need a clean air fund? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund. But If this passes, I won't have a choice.
559	If you were with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being watched by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.
560	In the state of Georgia, a child of 17 years old can not move out of their parents home without permission, unless another guardian is appointed or you are adopted. Contact your local juvenile office if you are in doubt. The only reason the law enforcement does not enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to do so and most police officers are not up to date on juvenile laws. Another few months will not hurt if you are truly in love and you can finish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then just maybe Mom will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!!!! Already been there!!!!
561	The first responder should be correct. I do not know Louisiana law, but I've never heard of a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.
562	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments, whether you are white, black, purple, or green, they have the right to discontinue their services to you. It sounds as though they gave you at least a couple of breaks and you chose to not do what is right and that is pay your bills on time. I have the right to say this as I am Native American and proud of it. I do not feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time if not early!
563	The sheriff's department does not have sales. They are not in the business of being creditors, liquidators, repossesors, or salesmen. They are bluffing you. They are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sheriff's department can do is allow a party to collect cars, etc. (not sure about furniture), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
564	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited...justice should be served even if criminals flee. However, we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are equal in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
565	Because someone did not think they were stupid or senseless when they were passed. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed. For example a law forbidding the consumption of meat during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn people about the dangers of eating that meat. What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful. The one you mention (about singing in the bath) seems to have some moral background. It seems stupid to us now, and it probably was stupid by the time it was passed, too. But it responded to the moral standards of that time.
566	The Nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily. That's what the Nazis did to various people groups. Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair". You should watch the documentary below:
567	In my opinion, no. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the child is small, it may not be an issue, but when he or she enters school, other children may ridicule him or her and cause emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a mother and a father. Not two women, and not two men.
568	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. It is not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. The issue is the Establishment clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
569	I think it's a good idea, because everyone at school is on the same level, at least in terms of appearance. Those students who are less fortunate and don't have much money to buy clothes or have few clothes don't have to worry about what they are going to wear. I think it helps their self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
570	No. Any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system. With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be executed. Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice. Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
571	If you are speaking of having the government interfere with what we as parents and responsible adults do to teach our children, then no. With regard to the FCC, and what is transmitted over the airwaves and is available for public display, yes. However, the government should also set absolute specifics for such media outlets. But when it comes to moral standards, parents should simply get off their lazy asses, and teach their children right from wrong, talk with them, and keep an open line of communication.
572	Here's my thought: I'm Irish and don't complain that Notre Dame's nickname is the "Fighting Irish." I don't go around saying my heritage is being mocked or that I'm offended because "people think I like fighting." It's ridiculous. If any Native Americans are really concerned about this issue, why not look at poverty on the reservations, poor schooling, etc? There's so much more to worry about than school mascot names.
573	Answer is no. However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information. There are many holdovers from the Clinton era. Newspapers are in the business of criticizing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind the freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
574	I disagree with American law, you do not need a piece of paper from anyone to prove to yourself that you are married. If you want a lifetime commitment from the person you love the most, just tell her that she is your wife and hold a ceremony in a place that you both find attractive, share your thoughts on the future and express your love for one another. And do not forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life, because that is what it is all about.
575	Your client? Give me a break, man. You're a crackpot conspiracy theorist. First, there is no consistent question within your rant of improperly formed English (incomplete) sentences. Second, the racism charges in your "question" make it highly suspect. Honestly, I am glad that your "client" is not allowed in the United States, because if he "hired" you, he should not be here.
576	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action. The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings. It generally would not apply to a civil proceeding. However, the defense of temporary insanity is extremely rare. Some states do not allow it at all. Others, just like the "permanent" insanity defense, restrict it considerably. Mental anguish is a tort. I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim. The fact that it's a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO.
577	It's boring and kind of scary. I'm not going to complain about the regular sex, but shower time could get out of hand. There are many good looking people in the hospital who need a smoke. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke. There are many good looking people in the hospital who aren't crazy, so it is worth going for it. So each has its pros and cons, but I would recommend psychiatric ward over jail. And jail over my last marriage.
578	There are tens of thousands of water companies in the U.S. and they are generally regulated by various federal and state agencies. If they meet those regulations, there is no basis for a suit, class action or otherwise. In order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence. If you don't like tap water, drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water. But, you will not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove they are negligent.
579	Yes and no; in the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but in the long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice. The same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
580	The adversarial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In that sense, it is ethical as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case for his client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the other side. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appelate courts. This is as good as it gets, folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.
581	Firstly, does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Second, unions are legal and allowed to sign up members. However, this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man, is he really an illegal allien? Then INS could come in and send him back. You know, unionism only grows when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group. Unions are not all demons, nor is management always the enemy, however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labor peace.
582	Certainly, you can be very clever and have terrible grades, but at the same time it is not smart to do poorly in school, thus limiting your opportunity. I almost get angry when I hear someone say this. Granted this is a blanket statement, and doesn't include outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or a disease, but I feel that 90% of the time laziness is to blame. I've heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge. Please change my view!
583	I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic), and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material. Why should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? Why should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter, it seems far simpler with less baggage. CMV, please.
584	The government should pay for all of these things, and the rich should pay more and the poor less.
585	I used to watch that show with my family, but now I find it to be mostly sexual jokes and I am embarrassed to watch it with them anymore.
586	I am not a'masculinist,' but I think it is unfair that males have higher rates of car accidents than females. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]
587	I have deleted the BBC, HuffPost, and CNN apps from my phone. I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?
588	After viewing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a bad move this is.
589	I really see no benefits in government recognition of marriage. First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality. Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency. Now to address some anticipated counter points: The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers. As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions? Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage. CMV.
590	People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich. I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! Additional taxes and discrimination on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior (or encouraging it to happen elsewhere where Americans don't benefit from spillover effects), and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.
591	Every time I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS." I see the number of casualties on both sides and things just don't add up. I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for the number of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians, resulting in genocide. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation." Despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
592	The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the U.S. into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
593	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more.
594	I know this is a touchy subject, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy and they will think it's okay to do again and again. Honesty: if some sicko did this to your child and caught them, what would you do? I'm only 23 and this subject angers me greatly. I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 (or younger) is too big. I feel like this should only be done for sexual crimes. I could be wrong though. I believe castration would be a suitable punnishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor with out a penis.
595	Being horny is a sin. Waking is a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin. Raping is a sin. If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what wrong and right actually are?
596	I've been researching this economic doctrine for some time, and I just don't understand how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being either ethical or particularly effective. I understand that this was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 1960s ended. However, I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, create serious economic inequality, erode social good, and continue to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I'm genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind of policy? Or does it simply concentrate wealth?
597	I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush would go down as the worst president in history. Let's review all of his failures: 1. Asleep at the wheel/ignoring all the warnings for 9/11. 2. Completely false/made up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region (as we are seeing now). 3. After starting two wars in the middle east, engaged in doomed attempt at nation building/bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies. 4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the Great Depression. 5. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services.
598	The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings. When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That is what the school system and laws in place do.
599	In the island of Ireland there is football; where you kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world, for example in the FIFA World Cup, but there is also Gaelic football. In America, there is soccer and football leagues. I believe the reason that American football is called football is that it is the national sport of that country, while soccer is the foreign sport.
600	I am in a long-distance relationship where there is pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. We both have inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am past 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I do not speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it at an elementary level). CMV. What beliefs do you hold that can make me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away everything in my home country? What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?
601	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations around the U.S. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them. PMA will be installed everywhere for the 50% of smartphone users in the U.S. who own an iPhone and Qi will die. CMV To be clear, I do not want this to happen. I support Qi and I do not like the data transmission (pushed ads) that PMA can do. So I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
602	I think that offsides in soccer should be eliminated. If both teams were forced to spread across the entire field, there would be more space for passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. This would allow for games to be much higher scoring, which would make them much more exciting and pleasing for the fans. Almost no games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be over, or at least greatly reduced.
603	Let me start by saying I was really into the whole UFO topic for several years. After extensively following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find, I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling like it's very likely that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. So many of the most credible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, so many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise. I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and it's all a big coverup, but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited.
604	In my opinion, all it serves to do is remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible, and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike". It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are'supposed' to have. Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
605	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a perpetual flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment, specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God, is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has ever done can ever come close to the scale of this.
606	I'll admit it. I like Daisy. Her voice is terrible, but that's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Furthermore, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. It allows Peach to be a playable character, it justifies her continued presence in spinoffs, and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive. Please, change my mind, because it's never going to happen and I don't want to die sad.
607	All my life I've been fascinated by economics and money. I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold/dollars/euros/etc. In particular, I see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use. As a consequence of this, I believe market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency. I have done a lot of FMA (failure mode analysis) on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I have invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Do you change your mind?
608	I believe that Bill Nye is a much more prominent figure among the younger generation and has all the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series. I am not saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job, but I simply believe that it would have been more fitting and symbolic to have Bill Nye, who has been fighting so long for knowledge, as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series, which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.
609	I am not trying to brag, but I am studying at university and getting good grades. This semester I have achieved mostly First Class grades, while my friends get 2:1s and 2:2s. It has become an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers. I am not trying to be arrogant, but I can't talk about this with any one of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more planning and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that now, and I feel it puts pressure on me to just keep at the top.
610	I have just completed a marathon of the series, and for my money, the first three were more enjoyable. The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV. There were some amazing set pieces, too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett. Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear and a little dumb. I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) were more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.
611	Metal is evil for several reasons. First, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as evil even by a fifth grader! If this dark genre is continued to prosper, our youth will be affected negatively! Second, the lifestyles of its artists. Most of them live very sinful and evil lifestyles. Is it because of the genre? I believe so.
612	Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush committed, becuase of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush is one that should be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush.
613	I have no idea why he wants to do this. Something with the debt. But the UN membership fee won't cause a big debt.
614	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way. Atheists say "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." And we are back to square one.
615	I agree. What practical benefit is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than curiosity, what could we hope to gain when the world is suffering from war, starvation, and job loss? I am not saying that I am not curious; I am fascinated when I get to watch a good program about space. However, we need to focus our resources on fixing what is wrong here on Earth before we go chasing the curiosities of the universe.
616	No, the world will not end. NASA will continue to look for asteroids, and I think it will be 3,000 years before we see them. The funny thing is, I made a bet with my friend that if the world does not end in 2012, I get $5. If it does, he gets $5. He said, "If we see the asteroids, I have to pay up." I cannot wait to receive those $5.
617	Yes, I do believe so. Within reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of disciplining has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.
618	My friend is moving to Texas, a place where she will be an outsider, and the town is mostly gang-ridden, and not far from the Mexico border. She is leaving everything behind, including family and friends. What do you think?
619	TJ was smarter than Sheldon because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from grade 4 to grade 10, he had no trouble doing the work and also taught the grade 10 class. He got into arguments with teachers, and he was always right. TJ was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk, and he was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart, maybe as smart as Sheldon.
620	As tempting as the "week debate" pun is (and it is), I don't think it's such a bad idea to start the year in the middle of winter. Why would we want to split up our weekend in such a short time? A work week is five days, then two days of play. I prefer calendars that start with Sunday because it's more appealing (symmetry), but, aside from window dressing, the week starts on Monday.
621	From the moment I walked in, there was already something wrong with my experience. No one greeted us, so my group of 5 decided to find a seat on our own. Once I sat down, the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not busy, so I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates. Horrible experience and would never go again.
622	I cannot believe I did not write a review for this place. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood and it is open 24 hours. Great place to go when you have the munchies while your watching a movie. My recommendations are: Full Montagu- Beef and turkey sandwich. Holiday Turkey- Very good if you like turkey. Original- Beef sandwich and it was nothing special. All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!! They also have salads and soups. Line moves pretty quickly so do not let the long line scare you away.
623	This place's idea about individual portions is pretty awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!
624	Raising Cane's is a good choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. Additionally, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw with your meal. Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
625	I can't sing New Way's praises enough. I live a short walk from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is very friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The Tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome as well as the hot Italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
626	We have gone twice already and won't be returning. The first time, the food was acceptable but the steaks were overcooked. We decided we'd give them another chance and order our steaks rare. The second time, we were seated and another 15 minutes later our food arrived. The steaks were overcooked again, even though we had ordered them rare. The vegetables were soggy and the lobster was rubbery. My son, who normally eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay. The woman asks how our experience was and we tell her it was awful. She said, "sorry, $34.24". We should have just walked out. I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
627	The pizza was alright and cost $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and whether or not you want to leave a tip. You have to hit "no" for the tip and sign. I would think that for take out orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menus, you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes, and ended up being 28 minutes. This is a new place, and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
628	Students should be allowed to express themselves. The uniform is boring.
629	I think they're bad because I think you should be free without anybody telling you what to do.
630	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's three children are in, are using school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the "in thing to wear." While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
631	Students have the right way to feel and express themselves, but it's wrong. It's the learning that makes us smart.
632	When you're out of college, or high school, or whatever, like in an office, you have to choose your own clothing.
633	I find that whatever works for one person is good for another. For example, Firefox has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer for me. The configuration isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config will understand what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definitely superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the 7 update.
634	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else uses "original"? I won't rebut your second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and isn't even an argument either.
635	I would not turn my wife in because I love her and we married for a reason. I would trust my wife to kill someone for a good reason, although murder is still murder. Gene Hackman killed the man her wife was cheating on.
636	I would definitely stand by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad, but I would say some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. That is a difficult question. If I truly loved this person, I would not turn them in. I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help through thick and thin till death do us part. There are divorces that happen all the time for various reasons, but I do not know this one very well.
637	Books are better than TV, because TV can make you blind. Your eyes can also hurt a lot if you watch it too much.
638	Books are better than TV because most of the TV shows kids watch add influences that are not good, and most parents don't care what their children watch. I thank books are better because you learn more from books.
639	I am a class 11 student. I have to take part in a debate, that's why I asked you. Please give me more information. I will be very grateful.
640	The increasing population means less land, and less land means a big crowd in every place. India is able to win gold medals in corrosion, terrorism, illeteracy, violence, etc.
641	I think if I had a father that did nothing for me, I wouldn't want him around. Chances are, you and him won't be speaking five years from now, so why try to make it work if you already know the outcome?
642	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a bad father because sometimes they get on your last nerve and they make you do things you don't want to do. But that's the way fathers are. You still have other people to look up to even though your dad is not around. I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there, so I really don't have a favorite side.
643	I think it's better if you're fatherless than a bad father, because your bad father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if you're a fatherless, it's going to be alright, but not great either, because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you're a bad father or a fatherless, they can encourage you to succeed in life and also help you correct your mistakes that you had made.
644	I would support the fact that being fatherless is better than having a bad father. Fathers are usually supposed to be the provider for the household and solve problems that come with them, but if you're not good at it, then why bother having kids. Kids look up to their father as an example of how to be a man and take responsibility for the actions they take. So why not be fatherless when having a bad father is the same thing?
645	As a young boy, you hope and pray that you have a father figure in your life who will be there when you need him. The last thing you need is someone who lives with you and does nothing to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man, it is important that you have someone in your life who supports you and pushes you to be successful in life.
646	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it would be orderly, elegant, rational, and modern, and he worked towards it. However, while he was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly, causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.
647	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles provided the planning, the strategizing, and was the one to select Singapore as another British base, giving early Singaporean support of the British. If William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder because he did the "grunt work", shouldn't the supervisor of a construction site get the most commission, instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he did not leave of free will.
648	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen. Also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's development, so he should be considered a founder.
649	Schooling Raffles established the Singapore Institution (now known as Raffles Institution), which completed its construction in the year 1837.
650	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools, and lands for government buildings.
651	Raffles found that Farquhar had done a bad job of raising the city of Singapore. He also introduced opium selling into Singapore in order to raise more money to build Singapore.
652	If you go live in that olden time, in just one month in those conditions, it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day. Hospitals were one thing Raffles built, and that would have saved so many people in those times because the living conditions were bad. Another reason he has helped in the development of hospitals.
653	Is it wrong? Yes, it is unhealthy? Yes, it is addictive. However, just because it is wrong, does not mean it should not exist.
654	If you are in a relationship then yes, porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is unrealistic and can split up relationships. If a man and a woman, or a man and a woman are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.
655	Okay, I believe that "God" created and then modified through evolution. We'll all find out within 100 years anyways.
656	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument. I'm very familiar with it. I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process. Both moth colors have always been there. It's just a matter of which is easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution. That's a diet plan.
657	Evolution is as unlikely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.
658	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues. First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 year old computer, it takes about 10 seconds or more to start it. Secondly, plug-ins I frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player do not perform well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
659	I am writing this using Firefox. Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support, which makes it unusable for at least the new Windows Virtual Earth.
660	Chorme is superior to all others because it is the fastest and safest, plus it is open source, like Firefox.
661	Even though Raffles did all the "so-called" planning, Farquhar made some plans of his own, too, since Raffles had to leave for Bencoolen. This meant that Farquhar had to plan on his own, too.
662	Farquhar was the one that played the role of a'mother' to Singapore. He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles, proving the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.
663	I am going to take the Obama approach to this. Abortion is never something a woman would take lightly. There will always be a lot of thinking, asking for help, and even praying involved in making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seem to understand that we also think abortion is a sad and awful thing, and we hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. Therefore, this decision should be left to the women, and not some man miles away in D.C. that has never faced it.
664	If a woman is raped and then left with the child of the man who raped her, then she should be allowed to decide whether or not to have the child. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one; the choice should be hers to make and she should be allowed to make it.
665	I am personally against abortion, but I believe in the right to choose. What matters to a pregnant woman is not what I or other people think about it. She must decide what to do with her child.
666	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. In other parts of the world, people will do whatever they want.
667	How can that be? How were you raised? Did you go to church? Sunday school? Pray before meals? Pray at school? Pray at night? I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully, my public school system stopped that practice). Please tell me where I have been brainwashed.
668	There is no concrete evidence that supports the existence of God. Religion and the Bible have so many contradictions and changes that I am becoming less and less convinced in his existence. Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive in different climates and situations.
669	I think the common good is a better endeavor because it's better to give than to receive. It's better to give other people your hand out in help than to hold your own.
670	Both endeavors are better to be part of, but I, as an individual, would like to advance the common good in this society by promoting non-petty competition, and encouraging people to do things the way they used to. Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some others will help the community to make it safe and better, and teach them what they are capable of, and encourage them to believe in themselves that they can do the things wealthy people do.
671	Advancing the common good is better for me because, If I were to pursue my own personal pursuits, they wouldn't be all that great because they would be selfish choices that would end up hurting someone else. I don't like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else's well-being before we thought about ourselves.
672	Student victimization is likely to be decreased, and fights and gang activity should be decreased, as there is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
673	Yes, school uniform is important. It is a logo for our school, and it reminds us that we are part of the school. If we don't wear our uniform, the teacher will give us a punishment, and from that, we can learn to be disciplined students. If we go out of school, the teacher will see that we have our school uniform on, and people will know that we are from that school.
674	It would be better to have a bad father than not have one at all. If you were to grow up without one, you would always have an empty void feeling. If your father is bad, it could cause you to strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because your father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is bad, but I'm still happy I know who he is. Just because I can' imagine wondering about it.
675	I think it's better to have a bad father than be fatherless. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong. But as long as you have a father, no matter how bad he is, at least you have somebody there to support your decisions and encourage you.
676	I think it's better to have a bad father than none at all, because a father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain way. A girl, for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girls who don't have fathers grow up with a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older, which shouldn't be the case.
677	Bottled water is not subject to the same regulations as tap water, so you do not know what you are drinking when you consume bottled water.
678	I agree that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in an emergency. Plastic bottles can release chemicals over time, and they end up in landfills. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself. Water is usually tap water, which is regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria.
679	Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to make the plastic bottles consumed in the US last year, and that does not include the petroleum used to transport them. That is enough oil to power 100,000 automobiles for a year.
680	In New York City alone, the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. In California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006, producing about 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.
681	If you do not save bottled water for an emergency, you are not thinking about later, you are thinking about the present. You are drinking bottled water when you do not even need to. Bottled water and tap water are the same thing. Tap water has less waste and is free.
682	Nowadays, no one can live without television. It is commonplace to watch television by everyone. Television is better than books. Everyone votes for television.
683	TV is important for communication, so that we can cross the character limit.
684	Because it is a source of entertainment and it helps people who can't read.
685	As long as people recycle the environment, the water bottles are thrown and polluted. It is not the water company's fault.
686	The marriage issue should be left to the church. Congress has no power to pass legislation forcing religious institutions to marry. Perhaps, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution. It does not break the separation between church and state ruled by the Supreme Court.
687	Homosexual people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living life right now without having to commit to anything. If it was like that for traditional marriage, life would be much better.
688	We have the potential. The only competition we have is China, who has done a much better job in the long run. But then again, the way India runs, it always makes order out of chaos.
689	Why do you think we cannot stand that question? Also, you forgot all the other choices: Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism and so on.
690	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc Atheism: rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense
691	I am pointing out that belief in God is called "faith" and we do not need proof to deal with this atheist. The idea of God being false is your own words, and I do not have to deal with this. Whatever you think is your faith, we will not stop you. Both sides contradict each other's belief and no one truly wins. This is probably a fight between two armies where both don't win until the end. Mostly, I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
692	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of Christians. I now see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
693	I am a Christian because I believe there is a just God who will judge all good and bad deeds done here on earth.
694	I'm not a Christian, but if you are, you really can't argue with them unless your argument is based on the same subject. It's similar to street fighting and UFC, though they are on different platforms.
695	If God does not exist, how come there are many predictions written thousands of years before Jesus that say exactly what happened to Jesus.
696	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirement, but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not doing well? Also, if you can separate boys from girls, give them some good games to do for physical education. The same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
697	In all honestly, who cares? If people want to be together, that is the end of it. We sell marriage on TV, in drive-thrus, etc. and that is fake love. If people really want to be together, then who are you to tell them no? If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. Also, what will you do when your kids are gay?
698	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups that are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that. Those three are #2,#3, and #5 on your list. #2 is a polling company that 'try' to write intelligently, but don't have research behind their writings. #1 has no real barring on the argument at hand.
699	The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." There's a loving God, eh?
700	There is an argument about whether gay marriage is acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong, however, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love, so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other sexuality, but a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman, and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!
701	I think that personal pursuit is better because I think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do, everything comes back to you, even if you are helping others. You don't want your life to be out of balance helping others.
702	I believe that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again, I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need, you do anything to help that family member. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you'll help the family member out, instead of the random person you don't know.
703	You do not say anything about your homelife. You have to have a very good reason for it. If you could get a job within walking distance, I think they consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home. I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If your homelife is the problem, get Social Services involved.
704	Since he knew about it, did not petition the court at that time, let a lot of time go by, the court will most likely view this as allowing it. However, he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. A lot better chance had he done it prior to her moving, or as soon as she moved.
705	The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways." People not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, but others have a right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. A liberal says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative is bash for "violating a person's freedom of speech." A conservative says something, a conservative objects, and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merits. So who is really against freedom of speech; the conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact you are offended by a statement?
706	Americans as a whole do not think this way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most states to have an abortion, but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law. Obviously, I am pro-women's rights.
707	Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it and you'll find that their crime rates are much lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it, of course. On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice. It's simply a matter of perspective. The typical Christian perspective goes against capital punishment and that's due to this Christian country. The simple truth is that it is effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, it is barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.
708	The dismissal in fact leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. "Without prejudice" means that the case was not adjudicated and no resolution has been made. However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies. You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Additionally, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this manner you protect your intersts - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
709	To answer your question and to refute the person who compared capital punishment to abortion: The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent. Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening. But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT A DOUBT concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row. And concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.
710	I believe that you need a fence around any pool in Ohio. Let me explain. If you do not put a fence around your pool, and a child sneaks in and drowns, you would be completely liable, and would likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit. To me, the risk isn't worth the reward, I would install it no matter what the law is (but yes, I think every pool in Ohio requires one). Also, if you don't have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.
711	This is a great question! I actually just learned about discrimination in the workplace and covered this topic. It's funny, because the law states that you cannot discriminate based on sex, color, or age. However, white men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. Basically, it is illegal to exclude them, but they are not protected! It seems kind of funny, but how often in America do they need protection?
712	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to force them to pay. My advice is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like. (This is the only reliable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal.) Then set up other payment arrangements with them. While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you. Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
713	We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card. Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number. However, our government has made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time. When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation. You can use a passport, or state issued ID & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc. The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have. Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundant worthless laws. And we keep re-electing them. So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies.
714	I haven't followed this case closely, but I believe that any law named after a person is questionable since those pushing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief, rather than reason. Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
715	Absolutely not. That is when we need those freedoms the most. We need to be able to say that "I do not like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prison. I may not agree with someone else's opinions, but I'll fight to the death to make sure they can state those opinions.
716	How do you think we got our freedom by standing back? In public, Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorist for the people of the world. We are not dictators. We are freedom fighters who fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE, AND LIBERTY. Unfortunately, people lost sight of that and voted wrong yesterday. And morally we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responible for their action and not blame it on science or society. Finally, for the budget there goes the state and national level budget, economy, and taxes. People want things to be in place for a better country and community. But who do you think we pay for it in the long run? We do with our taxes, not with the so called federal and state money people think we have.
717	The law is an obligation of society to which a person has to abide. Any law that violates your rights is morally wrong. However, your right should not hinder/hurt other people's rights or sentiments. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught. However, people tend to bend laws and break laws which have lesser penalties. For example, speeding, not wearing seatbelts, etc. Any law would be right if it does not invade the realms of human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change/modify. However, that is a very tiring and exhaustive process.
718	I completely agree with you on this subject. My animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. The first big display I know of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October! What happened to November 5th! If it was only for one night, it wouldn't be so bad. I can't sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. They are terrified! Even though the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. They are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. It should be illegal to sell them in shops. organizated displays should be set for the one night only, so animal lovers can help their pets with sedation. You are so right on this subject.
719	Thanks for bringing up this important issue. Most of the things you mentioned have beneficial uses. The danger is if they are misused. I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They are talking of retaining prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives, without charges or benefit of legal defense. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the process of government. I hope anyone who reads this is ready to defend liberty with their vote on the 7th.
720	If half the schools in the U.S. think that way, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I would have expected the civil war to be mentioned before sixth grade, the rest would follow. With this knowledge, one can understand why America is America and not some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. (Ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why half the youth is lost and confused)
721	In the realm of ethics, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child... However, legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he or she is older than 12. Additionally, I believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his or her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges.
722	I have never been a server or a waitress, but I feel that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should get minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. As for the tips, they have to earn them. Just think of a slow night and little or no tips...she walks away with what, $20 for working 8 hours on her feet. I think there should be a change in this, everyone should get nothing less than minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
723	I agree with you. If a person wishes to say the Pledge, they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing others to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain. It really annoys me when people try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country?? I would think that would trump anything else.
724	I disagree, in the first instance because this places a price on human life and dignity. Life can be given, it should not be sold. Second, because it is usually a short term decision that can be deeply regretted if you live long enough. You will, of course, sell only organs you can live without, a kidney or an eye... but what if, later in life, your remaining organ fails, and you do not have the money to replace it? You're in trouble, possibly dead if it was a kidney.
725	I'm sure he's not the first student to think of this. It's a given. You're taking a test to show what you have learned. Obviously he hasn't learned anything! That would be like getting surgery on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that". Tell him to use the energy he's scheming with to STUDY!
726	If the daughter was 19 and competent at the time, then all records are hers. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders. You need a lawyer involved.
727	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That is, of course, for the lucky ones, but the less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
728	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process. The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has his bias, etc.
729	When your time on earth is over, to the extent that people remember you fondly, and are changed for having known you, you have made a difference. I rest all of my hopes on the upbringing of my children. If I am a good father, and I believe I am, my children will be positively affected throughout their lives by the values I have taught and the examples I have provided. I also try to do so through various mentoring programs for those whose reality would be darker but for my involvement. I am satisfied that my involvement in all of these people's lives will have made a difference, and that they are better off having known me than they would have been otherwise.
730	It is biased, but what do you expect from a corporation that readily hands over personal Internet subject search records of Americans to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn? From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda. And it was dumb to pose that question. It is a crime to threaten the President, and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president. But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by, which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then they are fine with it. I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
731	Have you been standing out in the hot sun for too long? Hey, believe it or not, the rich people do pay lots of other people's taxes for them. But it's the middle class that gets the short end of the stick. The rest of your ramblings sound rather socialist. Are you insinuating liberals are emulating socialists? I never, in a million years, would have thought THAT.
732	To answer the previous post, the President can declare ANYONE, not just foreigners, a "person who might be aiding terrorists", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. This has completely negated habeas corpus. The President is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear', as happens in facist dictatorships.
733	I understand you mean "employee" and "unfair dismissal." In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at any time for any reason or no reason at all. However, there are restrictions. For example, employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states. SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case. Contact your local bar association for a reference.
734	I heard that in Australia and the U.S. (two countries that use ID cards, I think) there is a much higher rate of identity theft, because all someone would need to steal your identity is one card, instead of having to go through a lot of bills, etc. to get all your details. I think it's a stupid idea, and you'll probably end up having to have an ID card to prove who you are in order to get an ID card, or you'll need a passport, driving licence or some other such thing that not everybody has. Then again, if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of someone like the prime Minister and got all his money, then they would see how silly an idea it was.
735	I appreciate the way you started: "ALL RISE!" Also, there is no legal system that is perfect. Moreover, though, I do not trust "god," because he never talks to anyone except the leaders. This gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god! For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do that! Last but not least, was the Bush claim about America and her allies going to Iraq!
736	Fair trade capitalist. Extreme right. I hate any form of Marxism. I believe a man should be judged by who he is, not by his clothes. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the Bible. Public education is a waste of money due to the low literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day. I am not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change. We have always had storms and will always have wars. Because man is basically selfish.
737	I agree with you, unless perhaps the person can't due to a medical reason, etc., but other than that, yes. SHOW RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY! Our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for America and risk their lives, and some people here are too lazy to get off their ass to pledge allegiance to the flag. I think it is wrong. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
738	Last time I checked, he still has the right to a court appointment attorney...until then if you can't make bail or get a bondsmen, then I guess he will have to tough it till his court date...if he hates it that bad, then maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl. We all have our lessons to learn, some get the rough end for seemingly no reason sometimes...but this is life and you can't always come to their rescue.....even when sometimes you feel you need to...grown up problems come with grown up consequences that are sometimes hard to fix.
739	I do not think that there is a genetic component to being gay, but I do believe that people make up their minds about being gay and believe that they have been born with that orientation.
740	Although mergers of large companies are carefully analyzed before getting the "green light", the purchase of smaller companies by large companies is not considered problematic, even if the value of the small company is huge. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a large amount of personal information, which is Facebook's main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, I also feel some right of ours has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent and without giving me an option to opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my data does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
741	I live near a large navy base and everyone in my community respects the military. It is to the point that it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad is viewed down upon in my community. I do not believe that members of the Military are anything special and I think they should not be treated as such.
742	I own an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds. In my opinion, someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". IMO, handguns would be more dangerous because they are easily concealable. AK-47's and AR-15's are considered assault rifles even though they can't shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon (legally). Just because they look scary doesn't mean they are more dangerous. What say you?
743	Today a cat crossed the road and was partially injured, then killed by other cars passing over it. My sister cried emotionally watching this poor animal suffer, but I did not feel anything. Watching an animal die is unpleasant, but I do not think you should show emotion. I am arguing that it is fine to experience no emotion.
744	Once upon a time, paper checks were an easy way to transfer money from one checking account to another. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared. Direct deposit is paperless, which removes the need for employers to pay their employees with paper checks. Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.
745	The recession has hit men hardest, and they are not doing as well as they used to. Lots of men are still unemployed, and they aren't going to college at lower rates than ever. Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There are many secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field. Please CMV.
746	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How is that entertaining? I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
747	In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people. In both cases, an authority felt the need to land-grab, one secured their military base, the other wanted their holy land back also secured their military presence. Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths. Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing.
748	The actual leaders of bailed-out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figureheads or sacrificial lambs. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they've since quit. The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders get to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. That encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem. This would also help balance out inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down on the poor more than the rich. I don't like the death penalty in general because I don't think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes aren't foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably ARE. They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
749	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes this aggression is in response to violence initiated by individuals and this can be justified. For example, imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do not see the aggression by the state as problematic. For example, we say "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier" or "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs." These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations. One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence, and it will be as incomprehensible to them as the Spanish Inquisition is to us.
750	I believe that government is a good thing, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that it entails. What am I missing? Why is a good government a government that governs least, and thus needs less money? Who ever heard of a structure that does it's purpose best by doing it least? I don't understand it. Please help me understand it.
751	It is quite simple. Men who are wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They don't even need any game to get sex. It's too easy. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crap CMV. Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. It's more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. For this reason, I believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
752	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their (the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the Skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist. They abuse and mistreat those different from them. This makes them evil by today's morales and paints them (the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly, Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys. They have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just cartoon villains.
753	I believe the word they might be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture that is not just reserved for blacks. While the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have spawned from this culture that are bad for society. For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing). Another is the inherent disrespect that comes with the culture, and just overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos on Vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. It's despicable.
754	Ex: Christian A: denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other crazy stuff. Christian B: accepts that evolution is true, accepts that the whole concept of god as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good Christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person. Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I do not see how you can not take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take Christian fundies seriously.
755	I used to be part of the /r/NoFap community and felt pride when a day passed without masturbation. However, I never went longer than 2 weeks without masturbation. Each time I masturbated I felt dread and depression, knowing I would just masturbate again some time later. Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed. This basically confirms how I felt about masturbation in the beginning. It's bad for you. You could change my view with study or from experience yourself. Go ahead and try changing my view.
756	We are all capable of the horrendous acts that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us. I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities he engaged in. But there is historical perspective that could perhaps explain some of his attitudes. The entire concept of eugenics fed right into his Aryan superiority complex. And war is war. People can justify all kinds of horrible things when in that mode. Again, I am thoroughly disgusted by what he did, but I do not discount the possibility that I am capable of horrible things myself if I do not keep a focus on continually learning, growing, and evolving in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
757	Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner. I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.
758	One cannot decide whether or not one sex is greater in intelligence than the other. It will all depend upon the individual.
759	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still such attractive features to non-Americans that we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day. There is no doubt that we have our own societal ills, but the U.S. is still at the top of innovation, whereas China, India and even much of Europe can only replicate our inventions, follow in our research, and imitate our military strength.
760	Look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and have reptile-like behavior, our hair stands on its end when we are frightened, and we all have tail bones. I'm not an atheist, I believe in God. I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen, including that what was created would evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve. It's all part of the Master's plan. I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution, and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations.
761	Oil has long outlived its use. There is enough plastic in existence that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. All plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly ten years now that can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge. That exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. All production use oil damages the environment, causes numerous diseases, and is the primary cause of global warming. Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of animals per year, as they continue to affect the area of the spill decades after it occurred. Oil is the primary interest of the US in the Mid-east, and as such, it is the cause of numerous wars.
762	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support locking an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course, nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial number of people because, for the most part, animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. Fuck zoos.
763	I do not think such a thing should be enforced by law. In certain cases it is necessary to have privacy on the web. However, if you have nothing to hide, or are not reconnaissing, then there is no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people, for instance, post slander online attacking others but hide their identity? To me it is.
764	As of now, pride has much more talent than UFC. Pride has fighters from all over the world, where UFC is limited mostly to North America. It's not a USA vs. the world argument, just means there's a bigger talent pool to pick from for pride. Crocop & rampage have their reasons for coming over (who's to say Pride didn't send them over to promote pride in the U.S.), but still too many good fighters left in pride, i.e. Fedor.
765	I'm not interested in all the "they changed the way we make music" or "they were so deep" nonsense. I listen to rock and roll to have fun, not to think about life's deeper meanings.
766	Human beings are not able to live without the help of machines. This is seen in hospitals, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines, and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive and save them when they are on the brink of death. Furthermore, handphones, cars, mp3 players, and the infamous PSP that we see thousands of children, teens, and adults playing as well clearly show mankind's huge dependence on machines.
767	I would not want to earn my living this way, but, what right do I have to judge what someone else does with their life? I have enough trouble keeping track of myself. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it as you mature. I am only responsible for myself, and I will have to answer for whatever I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I'm right probably has a few more life experiences before them.
768	I would argue that people are basically good. That does not mean that all people are good all the time, or even that all people are basically good. We have all had bad eggs in our life, but that does not mean that we are essentially evil or selfish. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.
769	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. Okay, but keep in mind that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit. I let him slide on that too. What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances? Because of that I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances. He's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something else to do.
770	Yes it is... There are several times "no" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic. But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same? In both forms, the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them. The people choose those who agree with them. For an example: Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president. But still, the people choose, and that is where they combine and is the same: it is the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
771	Why do you go out of your way to take away someone's rights? We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. For some, getting married might be one of the milestones in their quest for happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if the gay community can get their rights taken away, then who is next?
772	Although it is not technically correct (Web 2.0 is not a new technical iteration of the WWW), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) A hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, mass marketers can use it, etc. etc. I know it's a flimsy argument and it will irritate a lot of people, including me, if it happens. But it's a name that works better than Semantic Web - SW is not the kind of name you see on cereal boxes.
773	I play guitar and don't feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE GUITAR HERO! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed.
774	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be very sexy, because there is no male in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Via versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
775	Victor Frankl was a psychiatrist and during World War II, he was a prisoner in a concentration camp. He said that in such a terrible condition, he felt free because he could choose to go insane or maintain the calm. Not only did he feel free, but he was free because freedom is choice. People can say that freedom is the capacity to do whatever you want. However, every choice has a consequence. For example, if tomorrow I steal a bank, I am going to jail. If I choose that path, I should accept the consequence.
776	I actually think GRAW on the 360 is the best military multi player game on the system. The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic (being based in a much more realistic future with less technological assumptions made). The gameplay is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field to novices alongside more experienced players. The interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.
777	I would not recommend this place, especially compared to other burrito places like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard burrito. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito, which had a lot of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help, and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other, costing me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! Would definitely not recommend.
778	My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos. They are not as good as before. I hope the other locations use better chips.
779	My husband, who is from the U.S.A., has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami, corned beef), so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since, in my opinion, their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!).
780	I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain. I looked for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place. It was very warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done. The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh, so that was good. I got a mango fruit tea and it was just too sweet and there was no ice in it, so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls. The kid who helped me didn't seem to be excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me. I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops. This was good but not great.
781	The burgers were good but the price was too high.
782	K O'Donnells is the place to be when it comes to food. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have an award-winning doggy patio where you can bring your dog to socialize with other dogs. If you're looking for a great happy hour, come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers. You can't go wrong with the daily specials and those specialty martini's!
783	Frequent customer at this Chipotle! It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the Happy Valley roundabout which can get busy when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also busy so the line gets lunch, especially at lunch time, but is typically pretty fast. Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us and asks us about our day. I switch between a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price. Love having a healthy quick option to go eat lunch or dinner. Would definitely recommend this to others. Oh and one thing I don't like... it's always super cold in here. Haha, so bring a jacket.
784	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy, so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself was very nice and clean, but the food was average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas, we will try another place.
785	Because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want, it's coolio hoolio.
786	Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and puts it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.
787	I use Linux and thank God there is not an IE version for Linux. Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will judge you about it. Oh yeah, and it's safe, cute, has add-ons, easy install, patches are released in less time, etc.
788	Who said anything about Firefox/Mozilla having anything to do with Steve Jobs/Apple? They are separate entities, not in the least bit attached! By the way, IE blows when making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to World Wide Web Consortiums standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
789	If my wife confided in me, I would not betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her, and I would. I would be extremely angry, and possibly even divorce her, depending on the type of murder.
790	India will not lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too wide, and they still heavily believe in the caste system.
791	This is completely illogical. No country should lead the world. We all started together, and that is the way it should end. Everyone has their own way. This is completely illogical.
792	I hope you will consider my views and reply me soon.
793	I would rather be without a father than have a bad father. I would want a good example to look up to and to talk to, not someone who is never there.
794	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
795	To be able to have a successful trading port, you must have good contacts with many people, and Raffles had those contacts. Without him, we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to point out that Raffles had all the important qualities of a founder, and he was in a good position to do so. He invested a lot, and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform, because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money, time, and effort in such a project.
796	Some would say that raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquhar incharge, therefore he neglected us. Imagine SST, Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us. Are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care of THEIR OWN SCHOOLS? Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
797	Porn is wrong unless it has very attractive lesbians in it. In fact, I am downloading pornography as I write this.
798	Pornography is wrong. If people watch it, they will want to have free sex. Free sex will bring disease, especially HIV. In morality, it is wrong.
799	It depends on your beliefs. Because I'm Christian, I believe it is, but to someone else who isn't Christian, it may be completely okay.
800	It should not be about how we got here, but why are we here.
801	If evolution is real, find me someone or something that is halfway.
802	Hey Nobrob, wasn't Internet Explorer invented before Firefox?
803	Personally, I believe Google Chrome is terrible, but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
804	Most of the government sites in India are designed only for Internet Explorer, so it is important to have IE on your computer.
805	Physical education teaches kids that it doesn't matter if you're a nerd or a jock, because they're all in the same class doing the same thing. And from my personal experience, sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside.
806	The answer is so obvious. Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their muscles and become thinner and more flexible, instead of fatter and more lazy, so they won't get bullied as much.
807	Physical education should be mandatory because 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far, and it is due to a lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese.
808	I think that PE classes should be obligatory in school to help with the problem of obesity.
809	Today, many students are playing computer games when school is over. This can lead to poor health, including serious diseases like cancer, due to electromagnetic waves.
810	Because real PE lessons provide opportunities for people to realize what they are capable of doing, which will strengthen their self-esteem, leading to them being productive in their society.
811	Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of'being too close to the local population.'I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
812	The right to abortion should not be abused, however, I do believe that the choice should be provided. NOBODY should make decisions about what an individual should do with her body.
813	It is the woman's choice. You cannot control her. (Anyway, how do you know she wouldn't kill herself in an attempt to kill her baby as well?)
814	If a woman cannot support a child emotionally, physically, or financially, she should have the right to choose to give up that child.
815	It depends on the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it is not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that is her fault for not being prepared.
816	Ironic, isn't it? Women are people, too, and it should be their choice what they bring into the world.
817	It is simple. How would we be able to adapt to different environments? Over time, we adapted to what suited us best. Otherwise, why are we not all the same skin color? Why are there so many different types of animals?
818	I enjoy pornography, masturbation is always enjoyable.
819	Yes, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already been done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that's already happened, so let's just go for it!
820	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
821	I am somewhat indecisive, as I always think that helping people is a good thing and a way to receive your blessings. However, sometimes you need to help yourself be successful and ensure that you can survive and provide. To a certain extent, it is good to help others, but then it is all about you.
822	Personally, I think that personal pursuit is better. There is no reason really, but I feel that I can help the people I care about most if I look out for myself instead of the world. If I focus on my goals, then one day I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about, and in return, I will help myself even more.
823	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do, school districts have to turn to such a thing. The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and changing into different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.
824	That's a great idea. I remember every morning thinking what to wear. It was a real problem. I spent a lot of time thinking about it. I asked my parents to buy me new clothes. I know that not everyone thinks the same way, but it's much better if the school has its own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First of all, it looks very nice and smart. Secondly, there is no envy that somebody has a really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about other things!!
825	I support this view. When I was studying at school, it wasn't a problem for me what to wear. At university, I spend too much time choosing clothes. First of all, it is wasting time. Second of all, when all students wear one uniform, there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.
826	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status. Some may be rich, some may not be that rich. Uniforms provide an equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them. If there is no uniform, then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford. Some insensitive children may also mock other students who wear old clothes. So I believe that uniform is essential, especially in developing countries.
827	If you don't want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't come yelling at me that your kids are underachieving, easily distracted, derelicts who can't focus their attention for five minutes in class. I may be exaggerating, but my message is clear: uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
828	I believe that the wearing of school uniforms should be encouraged because it reminds each child that they are equal, at least in school. It also shows unity, and children feel included, and it helps them to work as a team.
829	It is better to have a bad father than be fatherless, because you will have someone there to learn from and give you motivation to do better. You will never have that question in your mind of what it would have been like to have a father.
830	I'd rather have a bad father than no father at all. Having a bad father means you have a father who cares about you and loves you. You can fix it. If he's bad, you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mother about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
831	I would rather have a lousy father than be fatherless, because every dad is lousy in their own way. I don't always agree with my father, we don't always get along, and sometimes when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watches TV, and waits for my mother to make him food. That's pretty lousy to me, but at the end of the day, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yes, he'll get on my last nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than I, which makes him wiser in many ways.
832	The fish are drowning. Don't worry, potato. You are not alone.
833	Books are bad because it is harder to spell.
834	TV is superior to books because you learn more easily by watching, not reading.
835	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spread their garbage.
836	I have already had my say in the debate and Indians have at least managed to learn these mongrel's language and we are pretty good at it. But the rest of you English gimmicks stumble in your own tongue. I am quoting some sush102 "Hey its better dnt teach me wats the difference between chating and debating..... If I start my debate then na den u bloody will b 4ced to leave this site nd run away..." What crap? "dnt", "ma" "dis" what kind of crap that is.
837	The Indian economy is growing at an incredible rate and might even reach double-digit growth by 2013, as is the case with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time to come.
838	India certainly has the potential to lead the world. In our real world, power and weapons don't work anymore. Maybe the USA, UK, or other countries are more powerful, but India is economically more strong. It is the hub for many other companies.
839	India is on my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
840	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of God, there would be no valid proof that that God is Christian or not.
841	Spanking is your decision. Kids can be bad, but only use it as a last resort.
842	I agree, but it should only be used as a last resort and not used constantly, and it should not be too difficult.
843	I would answer in the affirmative, because children are becoming increasingly violent, and they need to be disciplined if they choose to behave unpredictably.
844	Yes, because if they are afraid of getting spanked, then they won't do it again. The parent should only spank them, and not go overboard and keep hitting them.
845	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not nearly as much resentment towards spanking, and today's kids are the most rebellious there are... There is a trend... I admit it is not purely spanking that is the cause, but it is a small part of the bigger picture
846	I am Christian, so I have to support my religion. I also get to go to church.
847	I am neither Christian nor Atheist, but I believe Christianity is superior to atheism. If there is no place for God in your life, it cannot even be called a life.
848	I would be glad to report my spouse for murder. Killing someone is the most horrible crime in this world. I do not want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I would not feel safe if we had children in the house or slept next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months.
849	I would agree, because my wife would be a murderer. Being a murderer is not the best life you can have, knowing that every day you will be under constant fear of when the police will break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your life is in danger.
850	I would have to agree. She committed murder, which can land you in serious trouble, even if you're an accomplice. It doesn't matter what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever. She killed someone. I will call the police as soon as she tells me, in case she decides to go on another killing spree or decides to kill me.
851	The one who bestows life is the one who bestows death.
852	I am pro-life in the way that abortion is being used today. It is like a last minute form of birth control. If you are not smart enough to use protection, take the pill, give up the baby. There are thousands of people who cannot have children who would love to have one.
853	A growing embryo is considered human, with the heartbeats initiating as early as the 21st day of conception. So, even if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead? If you are raped, does that give you the right to go out and kill someone?
854	I am speaking on behalf of the child, who deserves the same right to life as his mother.
855	There are many students who do not like Physical Education, so it should be an elective subject.
856	This is not a commonly known fact. Can you point me to a reference? Or are you suggesting that homosexuality is contributing to the spread of AIDS? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
857	I have many gay friends and I am for it. People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel when people are looking at them. Some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
858	I believe that everyone deserves to be happy. I have two good friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I do not have a problem being around them, either alone or with their partners. I believe that gay people have the same right to get married as I did when I married my husband. Everyone should be able to love who they want to love and even if they are gay, they should be able to get married just like heterosexual people.
859	In my opinion, personal pursuits are better for the individual. If you are not improving, you will not be able to serve the greater good.
860	I don't think many countries consider men having relations with men acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society/main religions. I doubt, however, people will ever really accept the union as a union under God. However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they're doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed up. It's their business what happens under the sheets.
861	Yes, they do have more power than they advertise. Since September 11, 2001, the government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "Terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law-abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution. The Patriot Act also allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on law-abiding citizens, as well as the ability to search cars, homes, and businesses without a warrant. This is also contrary to the writing of the constitution.
862	Should they be arrested? No, but they should definitely be fined a large amount. I am a firefighter/paramedic and I drive Code 3 all the time. The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic. You'd be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away. The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone. Hands free phones don't help that much either. You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with the traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver. The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all.
863	I do not particularly believe in psychics myself, but in a time of desperate need, most people, including myself, would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine had a sister who was missing for almost two years. Her family finally decided to use a psychic. Between the police and the psychic, her sister's body was found.
864	Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried, go back to the chat room and ask what they can do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedophile, though, because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
865	The difficulty in answering "yes" or "no" questions is not so much the specific question and the honest answer, but the ramifications of that answer.
866	Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, when the fetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo'. If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a fetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it. Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.
867	I think it all starts earlier than one suspects. For instance, when I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist, I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which could be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment. I encountered bafflement. "Any particular disability?" I was asked. I have a son who is disabled since the age of twelve. He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting. He has seen too much of people's attitudes. In many ways, we still live in the jungle.
868	They can now and here in Florida it is legal for a person to shoot if they feel that they are in danger for their life. And you know what? If someone bashed my door down, I'd shoot first and ask questions later. I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in God's name were they thinking? Some right wingers may think this is okay, but heaven help the cops.
869	I assume you are referring to the entire criminal justice system as the professional group. As in the series Law and Order, it involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. Part of the system is the law makers as well. Public policy is not always easy to define. Power and influence in an ideal democraacy would come from the people. However, we know that isn't really true. Young money will sway public opinion and buy almost any election and swing almost any vote whether it is public or in legistature. I am not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles." The direct enforcers offer direct power. The police and the judges. But those who actually make the laws provide the true power, and that comes back to the people with money to buy the influence to change laws. It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
870	You could file a defamation of character lawsuit. I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties. It's better off letting it slide, taking the high road and living your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions. Light always shines through the darkness, and I'm sure the people who know you are aware of your character.
871	I would prefer the death penalty for violent rape and child molestation, though I would accept a life sentence if necessary. Right now, we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been released from prison. What is the point of this? We make the lists because they are still dangerous, but if they are dangerous, why have they been released from prison in the first place? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
872	Lawyers are tricky. They typically only ask questions that they already know the answers to. They employ various tactics to get you to say what they want you to say, unless, of course, the lawyer is defending or representing you. Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by keeping a cool head, remain calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.
873	That is simply liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat...It's just "feel good" legislation. Makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant). Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. (And crime rates drop). And for the record, the Second Amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control. And hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
874	This is a difficult case to prove. First, you would need a lawyer to win. That constitutional right about bringing your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the person's actions caused you "Increased anxiety." As the testimony of a therapist. Then it would depend on your state laws. This is a hard case to prove, you might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you. Get ahold of either Legal aid, or the Attorney General's office to see if they have information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
875	It matters to those of us who went to school where all this was important, have parents or had parents who cared, and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of these applying to you, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant, and who can blame you?
876	You know, there is a thing called freedom. Maybe your grandfather died for it. People are free to speak and write how they want. If you don't like it, you don't have to talk to them or do business at a place that caters to Spanish speaking people. I mean, in China towns across the nation, Chinese and other Asian languages are spoken and advertised. The government has a lot it needs to do before it needs to worry about what language people are speaking. And, as people of your caliber often say, if you don't like how America is doing it, maybe you should leave.
877	Unfortunately, oil is the mainstay of all politics. However, can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Then use this energy to split water into its basic components. Release oxygen into the atmosphere. Use this Hydrogen in our cars, which would have water as a by-product. You could almost make this work in your backyard! We would only need lubricating oils then, which could probably be created from vegetable sources!
878	From an ethical standpoint, I think you should pay her back. She made it clear that it was a loan, and you agreed to it. I believe, however, that ethically she should forgive some portion of the debt because she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you.
879	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there.
880	You will not receive a warrant, I'm sure one has been issued, but they are not required to notify you that a warrant has been issued. Call the court and make payment arrangements. You will have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest, and whatever else the local laws allow them to tack on. Or you can simply ignore it, and the next time you get stopped for a simple traffic violation, you can get arrested for an outstanding warrant.
881	Don't bash Clinton! He eliminated the deficit, and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. What's it up to? Eight TRILLION plus? Who's paying for the Iraq war? Who's paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going?
882	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal. The primary determinant for a person to be such, is being brought up in a not-so-wholesome family/environment. With proper nurture, a person can grow and mature well. So, with the help of those psychologists and or psychiatrists, bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied.
883	We have a bunch of Good Ole' Boys up there scratching each other's backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. Get those 80-year old geysers out of there. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits. Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works; the Good Ole' Boy System. The Good Ole' Boys are just biding their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves. All incumbents -- OUT!
884	I am having a hard time believing you actually got fined for throwing a cigarette out of your window. Unless your area has a risk of forest fires, then I could understand. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation. Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off to the side of the road behind some foliage? Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you think you can win the case, then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system great. The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
885	If they are in your car and you are driving, then yes. I do not know about Illinois, but in California you are responsible for the passengers in your car, whether they are minors or adults. If one of your passengers isn't wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one, even if they are an adult. When they are not in your car (or even just if you are not driving it), you are not responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something saying you are.
886	You have to be careful on how you play your game here because if he can prove that anything you say about him is untrue, he may have grounds for his deformation suit. If he has wronged you, there are a couple of things you can do: 1. Sue him for the wrong he did to you. 2. Contact the Better Business Bureau in your area. 3. Report what he did to the government group that regulates car dealers in your area. 4. Contact the TV station in your area that does customer complaint reporting.
887	You should seek legal advice. You may lose your job and possibly your home due to a lack of money. You have nothing to lose! Your kids could starve and you could lose everything you own. Do something before that happens! The company will be heartbroken, I'm sure! Most of them couldn't care less about there people, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. I've seen it too many times. Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. The lawyer will tell you if you even have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
888	It is sad to say, but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good that prison is no longer a deterrent to crime.
889	I do not understand how he took the kids away from their mother. That is something that is extremely difficult to do in court. However, if your sister wants her family back, you should encourage her to be careful and to try and save some money on the side for herself just in case. Perhaps he still loves her and wants to return to his happy life. Just try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund. I wish your sister the best.
890	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to listen to private telephone conversations or read private e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — *without* the scrutiny and oversight of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy (however fake of a democracy it is anyway) and creates a state within the statue — usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships, in which secret services, torturers, etc. are also neither answerable to the law nor to the people.
891	Why am I a gay man who can be fired from any job in the country for being gay, can't have a civil union with my partner of nine years, no domestic partner rights, etc.? If it were up to some, I would be better off on some deserted island with like-minded people. Still grateful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights I do have.
892	Well, at the end of the day, a woman's body tells her when she is ready, she starts a period. However, whether she is mature enough is another matter.
893	Yes, you can be emancipated if you are not pregnant, but it certainly provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it. It took about 30 minutes of filling out forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of a judge. Fairly easy, really. And certainly, I do recommend it if you are going to need to be the one who signs for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.
894	I do not think it is fair when people get the death penalty. All they "suffer" is a little injection by a lethal shot. When they die, they have no worries and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars. The person/family they committed the crime against usually is tortured and suffers for the rest of their lives! It should be "eye for eye, tooth for tooth."
895	What does that mean? Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.
896	I believe our lives are our own and no one has the right to take it, except ourselves. If the pain, suffering and lack of hope is so unbearable, one should have the right to end his or her own life, be it by himself or herself or by asking someone else to do it. For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons. And if the person isn't able to do it on his own, asking someone else to do it, either by ending his life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating. Please keep in mind I'm talking about voluntary euthanasia, not non-voluntary euthanasia or involuntary euthanasia.
897	From a physical and chemical perspective, neurons are fired when we see, smell, hear, touch, and taste things. Those neurons interact with other neurons via chemical processes that are well understood. Eventually, those neurons interact with more neurons, and so on, and so forth... Eventually, motor neurons are triggered which cause us to respond to the sensory input. In no part of this process can I see a way to affect the chain reaction of neurons in any way. Sure, each of our brains is put together differently, and that means that each of us will respond differently to similar stimuli. But given the EXACT same situation, our brains will react exactly the same way to the exact same stimuli every time. So essentially, you never had a choice.
898	My reasoning is simple: - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre-cleaned". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities? - dishwashers rarely remove ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually. - dishwashers don't properly dry "deep" items like Tupperware and pots. If you aren't careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless.
899	"white privilege" is the idea that white people have better lives than minorities.
900	The invasion of Gaza is unjustified as well as impractical. It is the same as Iraq, you don't stop terrorism by coming in and ruining people's lives. Palestinians already hate Israel, and terrorizing Gaza only radicalizes people and turns them into Hamas militants. Aside from that, Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives, 50 israelis have died vs. 1500 palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfire. This is not about Hamas vs. Israel, it is about the people born in Gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare Gaza into subservience.
901	I have plenty more, but I'll wait until a debate commences.
902	Governments use propaganda that a soda tax will reduce obesity, but the reality is its just them being greedy trying to make even more money off the poor and middle class.
903	I saw the movie and felt like I wasted a chunk of my life. The only two scenes that were interesting at all were the ouija board scene and the ending. The rest was just people sleeping with the occasional noise. I can appreciate a slow build, but Paranormal Activity was just boring to me. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but it is beyond me how anyone could think that movie was entertaining or artistically noteworthy. Also, please do not use the sequels to defend the quality of the first film. I want to understand why the first film was so acclaimed even before any sequels were released.
904	I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it does not hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously laws similar to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public and so forth. Psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the user's quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.
905	In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people.
906	School's are a government run institution, designed for the betterment of it's students. As such, it is only fair that schools should provide a free, quality lunch for its pupils. For three primary reasons: 1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for upwards of seven hours feed them. 2. If you want to curb obesity, 3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.
907	Prostitution is between two consenting adults. Say the prostitute is in need of money, it is her/his choice how she earns the money and uses her body. To address people who claim prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients: this makes government regulation even more necessary. For people who associate prostitution with violence and crime (drugs), wouldn't it be much safer if it were legal, regulated, and taxed? It would reduce the crime associated with prostitution, increase tax revenue, and provide safe regulations.
908	I understand there is a lot of dislike towards people who post a question or an image that has been posted before, however I personally think it's a good thing that people do that. It's true that the person posting the question could easily do a search of previous posts and get their questions answered, but that deprives all the viewers of seeing an answer if they never thought of that question in the first place. For example, I'm a huge fan of /r/askhistorians, but I've never asked a question there. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions I wouldn't have thought about and then reading the answers to them. It works much the same with many other subs. As there's no easy way to view historic posts unless they are "top", unless things are reposted, then there's no way for others who didn't see it the first time to see it again.
909	Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on their behalf is tantamount to theft and should be illegal. I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their premises, but only if the police are involved, and the towing company is only allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or premises. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
910	I have read some scientific racism writing and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Shouldn't the differences between races be studied? People of different origins have different bodies, skeletons, skin color, etc. Why wouldn't they have a different brain? I don't think any race is superior to the other, just different. Just like the differences between genders don't make one superior to another. On the other hand, I don't want such research to be done because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
911	Please leave the footnote below, but remember to delete this sentence when replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you! _____ While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum. CMV.
912	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens possibly use to gain better insight about mankind? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation about almost all of human history. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together.
913	I think we should be putting millions into research of doing cool animal combinations. For example: a half gorilla, half octopus. The face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and it's also furry. I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not worried about God smiting us for creating abominations. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house. Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
914	I am a professional software engineer working for some of the big boys in the software field. Software should never be able to be patented (just copyrighted). This includes software algorithms. * Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (e.g., shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards). * Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards, etc.) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding, etc.) the only thing that should be protectable is the final product. * It doesn't give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. * Most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright, not patent.
915	I am not the one who created this topic by the way. But people free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound in theory, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.
916	I think black people have a bad name because they are in more jails than white people. I don't mean that white people aren't bad, just that they aren't as bad as black people. I think all monkeys and kreckers should be created equaly, but separately.
917	This whole smoking prohibition in public places is overrated; why can't it be a matter of decency? If a smoker is among non-smokers, then he should not smoke; if he must, he can smoke a cigarette in the toilet or something similar. I believe that if we involve manners in this issue, we won't have a problem at all.
918	Eight years ago I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I have to admit that there is little chance of the facts being available to them via regional news vendors. Do what you are told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and TV tells you which burger tastes best, so I guess they know which President is best too.
919	I do not think it is pointless, but our world has bigger problems like world poverty, population, pollution, and the biggest threat...global warming, which will kill 6.5 billion people, maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could focus on our world problems first and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that, and near the end we find out it is impossible to do, and everyone will die because of scientists caring too much about other things when their lives also could be in stake.
920	I disagree with filtering, but standardized. There should be domain extensions that are specific to "unsavory" industries, such as porn sites. This way, parents can block all incoming connections from a.xxx site.
921	This is easy, classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was performed centuries ago. They put down so-called "neo-classical" Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends-yet remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, R&B, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still jazz. Oh yeah, sire they are purists, but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played. Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the U.S. of A. New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown. Jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. Jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export.
922	The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of this right, and while the ruling did make headlines, most people do not understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for all. This ruling is a referendum on the wanton disregard of Bush and his administration to do something they all promised to do - protect the constitution.
923	Yes, it isn't that difficult, my grandma was married for about 50 years, and it only ended because she died. I have been married for seven years, Johnny Cash was married to June Carter for over 40 years, George Takei has been with the same man for almost 30 years, people do it all the time.
924	Test cricket is dying out, let's whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it.
925	Each religion is in the process of spreading their numbers, they do not care if they believe from the heart. Perhaps that is the reason why most terrorists are converts. Perhaps that is the reason why most people who are converted to Christianity are poor people, and they are shown the bait of money. So, is it the spread of belief or the head count? I think it is the latter.
926	Terminator because he is made of full metal and in the movie he said that he can live for millions of years. Plus, he can see everything when it is dark. All so, he is way smarter than Rob Cop. Rob Cop is just a half human and half metal, so if he gets shouted in the mouth, he would die. And every time he gets hit really bad, he will die quicker. That is why Terminator is so much better. Like if he gets shouted at, he won't die at all. He loses his own arm, but he can still walk really fast.
927	The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas or Iran or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion" and equates diplomacy to "the false comfort of appeasement" of the Nazi's.
928	How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask for their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car." Will certainly give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of taxpayers. Cops already do tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause. Guess what? If you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
929	I apologize for that. What do you think? The media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessmen with cigars. They no longer inform. Is anyone reminded of the 1976 movie "The Network"? I heard about that, and it can be used as evidence that today's news isn't really news. It's all about the ratings, and to get those, they need to use ridiculous tactics.
930	I think doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. It helped me retain information better when we were given assignments involving drawing and comics. I should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle stuff.
931	I'm going to say the machines, simply because they aren't easy to kill. Zombies, for example, require only one shot to the head or removal of the head, and once that happens, the machines can control other machines. Cars, supercomputers, cell phones, a whole city's power supply, and military weapons like jets and tanks. Once these machines get ahold of guns, we will have a huge war on our hands.
932	Indeed, why? It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of what we are.
933	It had a good plot, it was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that until the end. It had a good twist, and it had a moral. If you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie, then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.
934	We ate here last Friday and the food was delicious! Something that really stood out to me was the F'n Loaded Sliders. Filet Minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottomless basket of garlic fries! It was so good and the prices are not what you'd expect for such a delicious meal. You are getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!
935	I haven't been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was very good. The salad and soup bar, plus ice cream, was only $6.49. Two bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked average. They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken Rice Gone Wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons), and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you could possibly need, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or, in my case, both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak Spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.
936	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends. I love that you can order half size of the appetizers. Perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually bring our dog, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split half an order of the Cheesy-Crab Dip and half order of the Chicken Nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are! I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice),and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. This is a great choice, and on a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!
937	The room was clean and modern. The front desk staff was very rude. I will only stay here again if I have no other choice.
938	Unless you want security to treat your fiancé badly, do not go here. I do not care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing here. It is a joke. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and sore for a few days. Way to have a 300lb security guard push, shove, and grab a 120lb woman in heels, hope your ego is soaring. And by the way, we hadn't had a drink yet.
939	The ribeye steak I had was not seasoned at all and was over cooked when we requested medium well. The service was also not very good. It took a long time to get our food and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the setting was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!
940	We have been to Carpe Diem before, and we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner. It was a big mistake. The food was over-seasoned and overdone. The steak was overcooked; the quail was in a bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was overpriced. Salad was uninteresting and dressing was boring. Appetizer meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice, but the food didn't live up to it. They had our table decorated (for our anniversary), but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, or a dessert for our special occasion. Expensive and a night where we considered going home and having a glass of wine.
941	The service was great, but the food was expensive and not very good. The sliders I got were not cooked all the way through and the buns were greasy. I would order the fries again, but would not order the sliders again.
942	Only in private schools, and even then, I would only agree with it if it was a voluntary association. You see, I think school uniforms suppress free speech and take away from a youth's individuality.
943	I'm too lazy to explain why, so just take my word for it. I had to wear one for four years at school.
944	It's not comfortable to sit for hours in a classroom.
945	I am currently using Firefox, and it makes searching the internet relatively easier than using Internet Explorer.
946	The fact that the only reasonable argument IE users have is that they are cooler or get laid more is even more proof that Firefox is better.
947	At least Firefox is not a copycat like Internet Explorer 7, which copied Firefox's tabs.
948	No way, that's even better than a prenup! Her: "I'm leaving you and taking half of your money." Me: "Hope you like prison!"
949	As human beings, we are selfish and have been programmed with a survival mechanism that tells us to do whatever we can to protect the ones we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.
950	If my wife committed murder and told me about it, I would not turn her in because if you really love her, then you will have her back through anything, good or bad.
951	I don't believe I would turn them in for love, but I certainly would not stay with her; I would move away from her as far as I could. For the simple reason I wouldn't want to be involved in the crime, because I knew about it.
952	India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, they cannot even lead themselves.
953	No, last time I checked, rags were for scrubbing toilets, not wearing headgear. Whoop! USA.
954	Nah, they can't even organize their streets! They bathe in the same river where they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They're extremely poor, they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet! I'm going to get down-voted and insulted, but everything I have written is the truth.
955	I would rather be father less. It may sound bad, but I do not want to think of my father as a bad one. I would love my dad, but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father who just brought you problems. You don't have to have a father, you can talk to someone else. Maybe it's just because I'm a girl, and it would be easier for me to talk to my mom.
956	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge, but it allows them to be tough and dependent on themselves. Being fatherless is difficult, but in the end, it is better to be fatherless than have a bad father.
957	Farquhar has a boss! (Raffles)... he has to follow the raffles and not go about doing anything else. If then why can't Farquhar help Singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, and effort are all invested. You must know people who would help you.
958	Raffles was the one who stopped Singapore from being taken by the Dutch, as the Dutch were upset that Singapore would be taken by the British.
959	Is porn good for your health? No, it isn't. Opponents say that porn doesn't have a serious effect on health, however, studies have shown that it can damage your health slowly, especially your immune system. Eventually, those who engage in porn in their relationships will definitely not have good health as others. Here is a key question: smoking is bad for you, and so is porn. In fact, both of them are extremely bad for you.
960	Firefox is bloated now and uses far more memory than necessary. Once everyone buys a new PC and gets IE7, they'll have no excuse to switch to Firefox. Firefox better get their act together. They are becoming more and more like Mozillia who got gutted from a bloated Netscape. Firefox needs to get gutted. It shouldn't take all my system's memory to use a web browser.
961	If you hover over IE7's tabs, the tooltip will have the page title and address. Firefox 2.0 only has the title.
962	IE is much easier to use, and it's more visually appealing. It's also much more secure.
963	Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class than just running around the field for an hour.
964	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes.
965	You are absolutely correct. I'm in PE and they make us wear these ridiculous outfits. I think they make us wear those so the gay coaches can see our private parts. PE is just stupid.
966	William Farquhar was dismissed. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit them to Raffles.
967	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a larger ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which demonstrated how much the people loved him.
968	The people recognized William Farquhar as the founder because he was there to deal with the country's problems when Raffles failed to be there for them. He even took money out of his own pocket to resolve certain issues. When he was forced to leave, the people sent him off with sorrow in their hearts.
969	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way, I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. That decision should be made by the parents of the unborn child.
970	Unfortunately, most of what sabrejimmy says is garbage. This is what makes these debates pointless. You have some idiot creationists who don't understand anything about science. sabrejimmy hasn't attempted to learn anything from this debate. He continues to ask ridiculous questions. Personally, I think I will have to ignore his future posts. Intelligent debate is satisfying, but this isn't.
971	I call the "God of the Gaps." Early man's understanding of the universe was extremely limited. People did not know that earthquakes were caused by tectonic plates shifting. Therefore the idea of earthquakes being the work of an angry deity seemed logical. However, man's understanding of the universe has grown significantly. We now know that current species came to be from billions of years of evolution. Supporting creationism is holding humanity back. We need to accept the facts and let religion fade away.
972	Evolution does occur and has been documented and studied. I invite you to read this: http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html and give you your thoughts.
973	Porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
974	All humans have sexual desires. Sometimes, one just isn't in the mood for sex, and would like a simple release. Pornography allows for this.
975	The issue is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're okay with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
976	Porn is not always bad taste, but when it is giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there is nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.
977	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day, our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. The whole point of doing community service is to serve the common good. We have to help others in order to help ourselves.
978	According to educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they are with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.
979	I think that school uniforms are a good idea. First of all, they make students look nice and tidy. Second, we can know who is studying at which school or who is in the same school as us. And lastly, it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much time choosing clothes for school.
980	I think it would be better to have a bad father than no father. At least you have a father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kind of get an idea of what you are going to be when you grow up. If he is a bad father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you become a better father. Because you do not want to be like your father. You want to be better than your father.
981	I would rather have a father than none. Fathers play a huge role in children's lives. My father isn't very good, but he supports me and helps out sometimes. I would rather have a father than none.
982	Yes, I have a bottle of water next to me. It is not a big deal.
983	Using bottled water is only for emergencies, whether natural or human-caused. This will help people in need, while not polluting the environment or harming habitats by dumping them in the ocean or in landfills. Plastic does not decompose, so in that case, do not use it for emergencies.
984	TV is better because you can get information from different sources in a shorter amount of time, whereas books require more reading to get the same amount of information.
985	They can be recycled to make other things, like more water bottles. It also makes the water company rich. They're not expensive, it's about $3 for one of those big packs at Shaw's. That will keep you hydrated for a couple weeks for pocket change.
986	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottles everyday.
987	God created water bottles for a reason, because they're good.
988	Plastic water bottles all day, every day guys. Without those, we could comfortably walk around the block with a safe supply of water in our hands.
989	I like this website, but I don't find it very clear. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
990	Here is a reason why gay marriage could be wrong. If gay marriage is okay, then sister and brother marriage is okay, too? What is the difference? Oh, wait, the sex is the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BROTHER and SISTER is okay, right?
991	India surely has the potential to lead the world. Dr. Manmohan Singh is considered to be the most qualified prime minister in the world. India has proven its potential in various fields and aspects.
992	I'd like to point out how few disputes there are on the Christian side. That's because free-minded people don't need to convince others. We know that there isn't a god, and that it is up to us to make our lives.
993	For reasons that should be quite obvious, and which I assume have been thoroughly discussed by others involved.
994	Yes, because getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up, and two, it makes you listen. It's not abuse, it's getting spanked.
995	It should not be used constantly, but it should be used to get the point across to the child.
996	Well, as an active Pastafarian, I am disappointed in the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?
997	A parent should not use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized, and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self-esteem. Also, spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full of anger, and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
998	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals. I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
999	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't have been a pleasure/malicious kill, so the sentencing wouldn't have been so harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison, except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1000	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and then one night that you least expect it, they will try to kill you because it is on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cannot get out, and they need to get rid of all types of clues, even of those they love, just in case they try to talk to someone.
1001	I'm not trying to be facetious, but you seem to be suggesting that we should look to the government for guidance in our beliefs. Have you ever read T. Hobbes?
1002	I believe abortion is only permissible if the mother is unable to give birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her.
1003	I do not see the difference between killing an embroyo and a 40 year old person. Murder is murder.
1004	My question is this: why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
1005	Well, "The Champ." It isn't the woman's body we are talking about; it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible, don't let a new life die for it!
1006	Besides, only a few people incorporate physical exercise into their lives!
1007	A PE teacher's job must be really easy, they don't need to learn anything. All they have to do is yell at kids for an hour.
1008	Gym class is a waste of time for students. There should be a test to see if students can't run a mile without stopping every few feet. There is also the fact that students can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
1009	Gay marriage is not harmful to anyone. Gay marriage is not going to end the world. Gay marriage is not in any way affecting anyone but the two people getting married.
1010	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a choice.
1011	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be. I know I want to be a "winner", which by this happening means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
1012	I believe it is more important to have a personal pursuit because if you want to begin to help others you have to help yourself first. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself, you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. However, I do think that you can have a balance of both.
1013	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must be happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for yourself, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
1014	Obviously, everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world, or save the city. However, only a small percentage of people actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind, save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good, all of the economical cars and factories would not just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
1015	I believe that personal pursuit is better because it is more about you, then it is about other people. If you can't focus on yourself, how can you focus on or help others around you? I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that it is better to focus on yourself.
1016	Honestly, I believe that both are good. There is no better argument, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit: because you improve yourself for others and the environment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect, and we don't live in a perfect world, and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are not different, nor are they the same, but they are significant.
1017	There are many reasons why girls are out looking for a good time with guys in the wrong places, like the bar or disco or late night parties because guys are easily influenced by alcohol or drugs. Also, the media portrays "a good time" for young people as having sex, and it's uncool to go without it. Also, if parents try to warn them, they react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for because the "safety antenna" of girls aren't as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim. Thus, date rape is a consequence of all these factors. So girls need to take care, be aware of their own safety, don't give "strange" guys the upperhand if they don't want to be raped.
1018	The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I do not know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are addicted to drama. They do everything they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.
1019	No, they can't force you to do it. However, it may impair your credibility, so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not "believe in god" either. I also will not swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead I make only a documented affirmation. It works and is completely legal. (Save on notary fees to boot).
1020	The executor of the estate is supposed to divide up the remains equally, i think; and that means for everything that is sold, you get an equal share. If they sold it, it doesn't matter if they already spent their portion of what they got, they still owe you your share. You can sue them. It's a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parent dies.
1021	Purpose of punishment is to reform criminals but in some cases the criminal is beyond the process of reformation and enjoys his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopaths, and in some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that the conscience of an ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts capital punishment is needed. Furthermore, even the Law Commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban it, especially in the Indian system. Moreover, such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of society in mind and in the least cruel manner, i.e. by hanging. So, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
1022	While driving, it is always best to have two hands on the steering wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving. Although it may not be a law in your state, it is always best to set an example. I have had my fair share of drivers who were not paying attention cause they were on their cell phone.
1023	First of all, the ACLU would have nothing to do with this case. They generally only take cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties. Second of all, where's your source for this case? You have a few specific details, so surely you must have some news story or a link of some kind to more information? I have a hard time believing your statement. Third of all, the answer to your question is "no."
1024	Is it not the NY Times? At least they happen to be the paper that the Bush administration is targeting. The government has a web site, and a magazine dedicated to this very issue! Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story! What a scam! Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements, since 9/11, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding! Just another disgusting Bush administration tactic to distort and distract!
1025	No. Whoever made the first "response" is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is. I don't ever remember hearing of a valid case that had anything to do with the use of marijuana and someone being violent, much less some killing spree. Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances, especially when those substances are less harmful than the ones that are legal! Wake up! Also, to those who whine about it being a gateway drug: If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. It's made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
1026	You seem to be afraid of him having rights to your child should you die. If you do not want him to have rights to your child, you will need to get him to sign a legal document signing his rights away. Of course if he does sign his rights away, he will not be liable for child support. Check with your local social services office to see if they can still collect back child support if he signs away his rights to this child.
1027	Even when the sentence was ridiculous to begin with? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in prison for that long.
1028	I would try and get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today in most states employers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you. The other main way is with your taxes. When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husband's name and/or your name.
1029	I do not know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. It COSTS the state tons of money. My sister does this for a living and their departements are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation is not going to improve. It's really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them. There's just not enough hours in a day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
1030	I'm not sure I understand your point. In general, however, I would argue that morality and legality can be viewed as a Venn diagram. An act can be either or neither. We probably wouldn't want it any other way, actually. Hence the saying that "you can't legislate morality."
1031	I'm not sure, but I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing. Perhaps the defense lawyer is more of a general practice attorney who works on many different kinds of cases. Or, perhaps he (or your husband) is an idiot. Worst case scenario, he's trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
1032	I'm not an American, I'm Canadian and proud of that fact. There are things about the U.S. that I admire and envy, but there are also things about the U.S. that I don't like or respect. This war in Iraq is one of those things. I think it was a huge mistake to go in and do what they did. The civilian casualties are such a shame!
1033	If you live in Michigan they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking.
1034	I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path. As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face. I believe that you have the right to say what you want UNLESS it endangers someone else---for example no yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater and no soliciting murder. Laws about what passes your lips can't achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.
1035	It depends on what you want and what impression you want to make. If you want to show that you are a good citizen who should be let off the hook, then I would choose none of the above and choose something more traditional. If you do not care about the impression you are making, then go with the Birks.
1036	Civil rights- we are innocent until proven guilty, and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance- like, "you are a criminal waiting to step out of line." Terrible! It could even have the opposite effect, like, "they think I'm a criminal already, so why not do crime?". We still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that would be a huge violation of personal rights. Still, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, who will monitor the people who monitor the database?
1037	I think people sent to prison for drug abuse should be sent to rehab centers.
1038	It is not legal because it cannot be regulated by the government, because it is generally regarded as a gateway drug, leading to other, more dangerous drug use. Additionally, since it hasn't always been legal, such as in some European countries, legalizing it would lead to a massive initial interest in it, which would lead to increased health care costs, as well as decreased labor quality. Additionally, all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legitimate job, so it would also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sale, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics. It is a bad idea.
1039	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? If it involves a beautiful woman and a male minor, then it's okay. If it involves a guy and a girl minor, then it's bad. If it involves two minors together, then the laws should be less harsh than they are now. A good example would be when a good teacher gets in jail for doing it with a male student. For what? Making him one of the luckiest guys alive?
1040	If you and your mother are in agreement, then I see no reason why you should not go on your own. Check the local laws and statutes in your town. Usually 18 is the age of adulthood, but there are exceptions to that rule in some areas. If you go live with a relative and you are "underage", then a guardianship contract would have to be amended by both parties, your parents and your live-in relatives or adult-head of house. But I really do not think they will make a big deal out of just being one year away from adulthood for you, or anyone else, anywhere! I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny, my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, okay?
1041	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade-off... I favor harvesting of stem cells from donated cord blood and see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
1042	I think that making murder punishable by murder is a joke. What is the difference between the criminal and the law if both are commiting murder? Also, if I were facing life in prison, I would much prefer the death penalty. I'm sure many people on death row see it that way. Unfortunately, in my country we have abolished the death penalty long ago. Now killers have to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives rather than getting an easy way out. We are supposed to be promoting modern liberal Western values to the rest of the world, but it is not very good when the West's leading nation itself cannot follow these ideals.
1043	Is this a question or a criticism of the United States? I don't know. I often ask myself that same question. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probably not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have an atomic bomb. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yes, that would be great. I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controlling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the only country crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one... Yes, that would be great.
1044	You will do fine if you have the education and the training. However, be aware that the people who you will deal with are living in a different reality than you and I. The strong survive and power means everything. I happened to be a tall, strong law enforcement officer and I rarely have a suspect fight me. If you are small in nature, you may have to fight more. Also, keep in mind, most of the time you will have one or more backup officers with you. Citizens who see us three or more deep arresting someone don't realize that we bring a lot of officers out to avoid fights. We know the nature of these people. With that said, all of the smaller officers I know are fully capable of doing this job. Just be aware of what you might be getting into.
1045	I know it's a cliché, but it isn't insulting. India isn't poor, it's rich in history and everything. If you think India is poor, it stays poor. If you can write better English, more people get jobs, and lo and behold, India becomes rich!
1046	If you listen, they say "you have the right to remain silent." It is their right to not have to say anything. Also, when you are being questioned, you aren't always a criminal. Remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent. At the time when they are questioning them they are suspects. Also, I'm sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to do so, they would make up a lot of junk and waste the polic officer's time anyways.
1047	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it, then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted. However, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think HUNGER is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.
1048	No, you are using the equipment provided for you as an employee, and the school has the right to ensure that it is not being used for any illegal purpose. If you do not like the terms of the contract you sign to use school computers for e-mail, then you should just stop using them. They will also monitor the web sites you, or any of the pupils, visit.
1049	We are not taught from a young age to respect alcohol. If we treated it more like Europeans, it would not be considered taboo. That is why so many teenagers have to drink until they are sick and act like twits. Also, those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You ain't sexy when you get drunk. Backwards is alcohol thinking in America.
1050	I would say 18 years old. Yes, it is still young, but by that time, you should have finished your High School and have lived under your parents law for a long time. Just like you said, you can go fight wars and vote. That is a big responsibility. If you are old enough to die and old enough to vote, then I think the legal age should be 18. As far as drinking is concerned, let's be realistic, if someone under age wants to drink they can get a license. It is not that hard.
1051	No, he's already way over his head in California. Besides, we have a president right now who is not really up to the challenges of presidency, and I don't want to repeat that. Plus, I think that a president of his country should be born here. Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status, but not the presidency.
1052	I certainly do not fear "the competition." Besides the fact that my husband is very good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are far from "very hot chick." Most of them are drug-addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own sex. Personally, I believe that it should be legalized, as this removes much of the mystery and sordidness from the whole situation. Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.
1053	I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits. * The state's hands are kept clean. * An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, and during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents. * The convict's freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important. * If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out". * The method of suicide should be left up to the convict. * No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.
1054	We are born, we live, we die. These are constants in our lives. We know that these things are going to happen. So, what is the point in being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transition phase of my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something. CMV.
1055	"Be yourself" is an attitude that hurts people who have it, and everybody around them as well. It's an excuse for doing all sorts of stupid shit and not improving yourself. We, as a civilization, have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection and doing everything to make lives of their descendants as good as possible. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction) under parole of "that is who I am and you have no right to judge me"
1056	I am looking for proof that progress is being made recently, or how aggressiveness pays off.
1057	You have no control over what city or country you are from, like you have no control over what color your skin is. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from, and not how they play.
1058	It has become increasingly clear that the country does not work for the betterment of its citizenry and I do not see it moving in the direction of ever reaching some sort of equilibrium in which it does. The culture there just continues to go in the wrong direction of idolization and total submission, and people become more and more programmed to accept that over generations. People are working and are barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be united and the South Korean system should be accepted. This is difficult to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going. How this is to happen is not really a concern of the topic posted.
1059	Surely the whole #bringbackourgirls is self-defeating. This isn't to say I don't support the sentiment, and I do think it's a truly heinous situation, but it doesn't make sense. I feel it paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror, and to a degree supports/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything. There are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, I do think that a lot of people will feel this particular campaign has a lot of merit, but I just don't think it works this time for the reason above.
1060	I think we should put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun. Perhaps we could do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldn't burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1061	I know that with science most people are now able to have children, but I feel that it is selfish. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend over $3000 on a surrogate agency doesn't make sense to me. Also, the most successful surrogate agencies happen in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies. Child birth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking, so knowing that a woman went through that just to give birth to a child she will never see again doesn't seem right.
1062	Polyamory has been discussed a lot in the media recently, and I tend to read the comments on these articles. The comments are not always positive, with people tending to write "Nope" or "Ick." I am in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I have a stake in this fight. We live together, they are not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable, and long-term. What is objectively wrong with my relationships? And yes, I know it is not for everyone; that is not an argument in itself.
1063	All of my grandparents were born somewhere from the late 1920's to the end of the 1930's and according to most of what I've heard marriage was just "something they did". Society, for whatever reason, just expected them to get married young and have lots of children.
1064	I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now, I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it. Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.
1065	This is partly inspired by the "new look" Ronald McDonald that was revealed on Twitter recently. I feel that companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link in developing minds that these products are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent -- and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia.
1066	I am an Aussie sports fanatic, but I cannot understand the massive following for baseball and American Football. I have tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports. I feel like I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and that if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects then I would enjoy them a lot more. Are these sports really that exciting? Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought? Please change my view, as I would love to get involved.
1067	I never tip, because I think it reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a substandard wage to people based on their chosen occupation. I think tipping should be banned, and in its place, employers should be legally obligated to pay a realistic and survivable wage, then if people decide to tip, then it should go directly to the server. I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay $2 an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X% on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage when it should be their employers.
1068	Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They are leaders in technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I have lived in this region my entire life, and even though we took a beating economically, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. Too many stick in the mud, you know. Tourism is an economic driver, but it shouldn't be the only one. For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015. That may be my opportunity to move to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.
1069	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have appeared in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday scenario. I am not talking about robots taking jobs or military AI systems gunning people down. I mean Bostrom's paper clip machine scenarios. That is, you have AI system that you give some objective, and it takes over everything, improving itself, rearranging your atoms to its will, all to fulfill what seemed like a mundane objective function of making paperclips. Anyway, I do not think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research. To me it seems the focus (with deep learning etc.) is on imitating the cortex's memory system and building really powerful classifiers. I'm not saying we shouldn't theorize potential disaster, but I think the current fear is overblown CMV.
1070	I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but it has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If I smoke marijuana, I am infinitely more prone to danger from police than from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.
1071	Sure, some brand styling choices could be understood, but in almost 40 years, we have figured out what a general purpose all-around video game controller should be. Two thumbsticks, four thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons, and two triggers. So why the different placement of the directional pad and left stick for Microsoft and Sony when the controllers are functionally identical in every other way? I think there is a superior layout, (which one I think it is, is irrelevant) and one of the companies simply can't budge because of stubbornness.
1072	I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
1073	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest. That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).
1074	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat, pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed.
1075	* Nobody should take a drug they do not understand the effects of, and removing drug stigma is the first step to increasing people's education on the subject. * Nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all. * Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. * Everybody should be able to buy govt approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking. * Everyone knows the war on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you don't think people should be able to do drugs but you can't say your solution is prohibition, but I know a guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth. Squares would not believe how easy it actually is to buy hard drugs.
1076	This is in relation to the recent Indian election in which the Hindu Nationalist Narendra Modi won with a landslide. I can see nothing good in Narendra Modi for the long term. Although it may be true that he has a good economic record in Gujarat, he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity). Aside from this specific instance, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt than effective and intolerant in the abstract?
1077	I think that could be a contributing factor. Additionally, our media does not show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. There are thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc. Having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It is easy to grow complacent when it isn't your children being blown to pieces, your town left in ruins or your legs being blown off. That is why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier who died believing he was protecting his family and country.
1078	I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana. There are several benefits to legalizing it, such as: 1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the workforce. 2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system. 3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. As a result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market. I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs), but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
1079	Yes. It is safer than alcohol, it is nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal, it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed), and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (as they do with weed houses), that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.
1080	There's really no debate here, but no one checks the forums and I want this to get some attention. This website has become stagnant and there is almost no intellectual stimulation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothered by the lack of general participation. It's been weeks since I learned something or read something worthwhile here and that really needs to change. I'm going to make an effort to have a plethora of debates (about 5 a week) and they'll start with W.U.C (Wake Up Convinceme). They'll cover a range of political, social, and moral issues that I feel are stimulating and not discussed enough to maybe bring this website back.
1081	This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good. It's legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy. We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them. This should be a no-brainer for anyone who claims to value freedom.
1082	Hitler invaded Poland in 1932 and the world rose against Germany. In fact, there have been dozens of cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations and the world has been outraged and rose against it. Yet, some stupid Texan does it and gets away with it. Try him for war crimes, along with Tony Blair, and have them both executed or imprisoned.
1083	Truth be told, truth is different for each and every one of us. For example, my truth is that when I flush the toilet, the water flows counter-clockwise. However, for someone from Brazil, their truth is that it flows clockwise. So, in a sense, we are both right. Or, I could give the typical Christian answer and say Jesus is the truth: the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
1084	In the NFL, it is safe to say that not every position is created equal. Kickers aren't paid as much as running backs, and running backs aren't paid as much as quarterbacks. Quarterbacks are paid more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions they make. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a team's success rides more on their ability than any other position on the team.
1085	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill is concerned, and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
1086	Let me start by defining what wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two unarmed persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. Are we seeing this on television? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats, etc as weapons which means that they are harmed! The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, I can remember clearly the'UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!...
1087	We all know that guys want to get some sex to impress their friends and show off that they have some. Soon after, the guy will leave the girl after he bangs her and goes off to someone else. Well, we all know that when it comes down to it, guys pressure their girls to have sex when they aren't ready and if the guy wants it really bad, he'll break up with the girl and go out with someone else that will give him some so he can feel sastified. That doesn't make any girl feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a low selfish asshole.
1088	We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education, there are consequences such as many children's futures will disintegrate. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and success; what right does anyone have to refuse to educate someone simply because they are unable to provide the funds required?
1089	Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless I'm missing something Heaven, and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
1090	In the long run this is a good thing for the economy. China has kept its currency really low so that it can continue to provide really cheap goods to the US. If the dollar gets low enough in comparison, Chinese goods will become more expensive, hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers.
1091	I went here for dinner on my last night in Montreal. It seemed to be popular, and was busy on this particular night. We got a table and started ordering. The pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get don't show up, but there is a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see it individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one table ordered went to another table and vice versa. The sushi was good, though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered.
1092	The new space is phenomenal, and the food was even better than we expected. We had the rib taco and the brisket taco and both were outstanding. We also had the slaw and the black beans which were very fresh and tasty. They know how to cook. I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation because it gets busy.
1093	We really enjoyed the food and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be going back to Zeta's again.
1094	I am not sure why this place has such poor reviews. The food, drinks, and atmosphere were great. I found the service to be a bit slow, but that was fine with me. The nachos were delicious and my fish tacos were full of flavor and authentic tasting. The Caesar was one of the best I've ever had! I think the restaurant started off a bit slow and rough when they opened, which is probably why they have such poor reviews, but trust me when I say this, give it a go! The prices are on point, the menu has great options, and the atmosphere is perfect for a summer's night out!
1095	If there is no star at all, I'll go with that one. Went there on 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of 6. We ordered hummus as an appetiser and the main entrees were potato pizza, lobster gnocchi, roasted chicken and burgers. Three of us ended up having diarrhea in the middle of the night. Some came with the feeling of puking. One of us had acid reflex and lots of gas disturbing the whole night. Other 2 had some gas problem. Don't know what was going on with the food that evening but will definitely not go back again.
1096	There is not much in Mesa for wine bars, and D'Vine is a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town. It is right around the corner for me, and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale. The food has always been tasty and the staff has been friendly each time we've come in. Nice ambiance and the live music has been great so far. Only wish is they'd stay open a little later on the weekends. 11pm would be perfect.
1097	I am very fond of this place. Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. It's not flashy, but the food is always great. Chicken, beef, and vegetables are all excellent. My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake, which didn't taste like I expected it to. Perhaps I am used to an over-sugared American version of it.
1098	I wish that I would have gone to McDonalds and had the same experience, if not better. Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad. Thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Boo!!! It's amazing how this place is still getting a very high rating.
1099	I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses that IE has, yet you continue to use it?! The main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked, IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order to search two websites at the same time. It's pointless. :/ Oh, and Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
1100	FireFox is the best! I know because I have it! The only reason more people use Internet Explorer is because it is the default browser on most computers. I bet 90% of the people who support Internet Explorer only know that single browser.
1101	If my husband committed a murder, I would most likely not turn him in. He is my husband, and I will be there for him, for better or for worse. I know he made a big mistake, but I do not think I would have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be there for each other, no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.
1102	I do not think I could turn in my spouse, or my family and friends if they committed a murder. Those people are too close to me, and I cannot picture my life without them. Why would anyone send away someone they love? That is wrong, especially if you live with the person.
1103	I would say books are better because they require imagination, the more you read, the more your imagination improves, and it helps with reading, grammar, and writing skills. Also, I hate commercials. I hate Spongebob. I would say PBS Kids, History Channel, and other channels that help kids or adults get smarter.
1104	Books even reduce our electricity bills, which use a large amount of our spending money.
1105	Books make you smarter, they can also tell you what other people are thinking.
1106	It is absolutely idiotic to say the people who cannot read would always run away from them. Even then, B is for books and B is for best. Books are the best. I can't sleep if I don't read a chapter from a novel each day. Actually, sometimes I feel reading books all day becomes boring, so I only watch TV and those two news channels. By reading books, I can pass my time, and even improve my speaking skills.
1107	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation could lead the world. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literate, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. India doesn't have yet the potential and ability to sustain the needs of its people.
1108	I am unsure of the answer to this question, but I would have to say "fatherless." I would rather have no man in my life than have someone who isn't concerned about your life at all. To me, that is similar to being fatherless. I can always find another father figure, or perhaps a male role model.
1109	A father is someone who is always there for you. He is the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and attends all of your baseball games. A father is someone who protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone who does not care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you? A lousy father is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, than a father who I cannot even trust my life with.
1110	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. I was taught that a true man should be respectable, honest, and hard-working. If he is not that kind of man, then he does not deserve to be a father. Besides, just because you do not have a father, that does not mean you can't have a father figure in your life.
1111	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather be fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that isn't good? A father should set a good example for his children. If the dad isn't good, then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a bad father, I would tell him to step up and be the dad he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1112	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate to him. It was therefore only natural that Raffles gave Farquhar the responsibility of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to manage.
1113	I think the people who watch porn are fine, it's normal. The people who are in the porn are not normal, I read in an abnormal psychology book that they have a disorder.
1114	This not only degrades morality, but it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. This at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.
1115	I think it's wrong, it goes against women's rights, and those girls are underage and abused. It's also sick in a sick way. What freak would film people having sex?! I don't understand it. I don't see what's so good about it. If you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
1116	I think that watching people have sex is wrong, and I don't think that everyone feels the same way, but if you want to watch people have sex, you should get a mirror and have sex yourself. Kids are watching it and doing the wrong things!
1117	Jarman: Porn is wrong because it should be in 4-D, with surround sound and special effects. It would make it much more pleasurable, by the way, I'm a girl.
1118	According to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived. Therefore, I am not really sure how that argument holds up.
1119	If evolution is true, then how come people aren't still evolving?
1120	Actually, you must know nothing about debate because what I am doing is called "Cross Examining" and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. Also, calling names never won a debate. You just cannot answer my questions, and I'm sure that is frustrating for you.
1121	1. Why is creation not science? 2. Why is this classified under the religion category? 3. Do you deluded people think you look like monkeys?
1122	Hey, IE has the best virus interface in the world, so why shouldn't you welcome those little cute viruses by sticking with M$ IE?
1123	They say FF loads faster than IE, but nine times out of ten, someone who has just installed FF will experience slower program load times than when loading IE.
1124	It's an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid 2500% more than the average Firefox user. Sorry Firefox losers... game set match go cry about IE somewhere else 8*(
1125	If physical education was not required, then you would be a couch potato! How would you like that?
1126	There were many pests at that time, and people suffered from them. Raffles was not around, so William had to think of a solution himself.
1127	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore could prosper, Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
1128	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
1129	Farquhar was the one to put the ideas into action, whereas Raffles was only a thinker who could see what would or wouldn't work.
1130	Farquhar was unfairly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
1131	I do not think a mother should have the choice of killing her child, but I think she does have the choice of whether or not to consider a fetus human. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have equal rights to a cow.
1132	People can make the choice for themselves. It is not up to us or the government to decide to add more unwanted children into this world.
1133	Here's a story from a few years ago. A young girl, living in poverty in South America, was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant with twins. Her family knew she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout Catholics. She and her twin children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
1134	Abortion is okay because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria: You must be human (homo sapiens) and you must be able to contribute to society. By this criteria, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.
1135	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe that life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
1136	I have to say on this issue is that there is actual evidence to support evolution!
1137	Is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then, not in 2000? Why would God have to change anything? He created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself, "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." All of this makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
1138	How come people aren't still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are not evolving? And don't say, because we would notice if we were. Solid, verifiable evidence is your key to proving your point.
1139	My wife and I have an exciting and passionate love life. We love the porn. We pop it on and use it to set the room on fire. For us, it is a way to share and expand the love we enjoy together in the bedroom. As long as it is legal and everyone is of legal age, then there should be no problem.
1140	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out, it's more likely that everything will turn out great. You get to become a role model by helping someone who needs your help. Yes, personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college, but then you have to think about leaving a legacy behind by teaching others what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. Therefore, you let others take it to the next level.
1141	In my opinion, advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by the person or people you help, but it makes you feel better as well. That does not mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I will do my best to accomplish that.
1142	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want to hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if you're too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, you're merely taking up space.
1143	Advancing the common good is always preferable to personal pursuit. However, most people choose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
1144	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not selfish. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people, then there would be no need for a common good. You are the only person who knows what you feel, think, and believe. If you want change, you would make change to yourself.
1145	I believe advancing the common good is preferable, because it will eventually come back to you. If you improve the world in any way, it will help you in some way. Whether it be money, fame, or simply karma.
1146	Good idea to separate student from other people for at least increase garment job. Why do we use soldier uniform? For separation from civil. Why do terrorists not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
1147	school uniform does no harm to students' lives emotions. Now, as for the point of expressing oneself, imagine one bully wearing shirt, tie, pants all neatly ironed and well polished shoes. Wouldn't he look good? Remember, dressing sense also is a part of your interview.
1148	I think it would be better to have a bad father, because at least you have someone there. Maybe you could knock some sense into him, and he would become a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a bad father is better than no father.
1149	I believe it is better to have a bad father than none at all. It is important to have a role model to look up to, and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A bad father isn't all that bad, because what exactly makes a bad father is always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him, or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
1150	It's better to have a bad father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you make on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think you need it. He wouldn't care enough to throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall, making a hole in it, because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion, because that kind of father is still bad, because he will tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
1151	I do not ever want to be here. Like punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare. If it falls apart, I would surely wake it. Bright lights would cleanse me. This is worse than it seems.
1152	I think TV is better when you are watching an informational channel, and it is better than books, because you can switch between different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects, and when you are finished learning and ready to relax, you can switch to a funny show or whatever else you want to watch.
1153	If you're fluent in one language but you speak another, then when you move to another country, the books will not be in your language but TV is in many different languages, so you can hear how the words are said in other languages.
1154	Gay marriage can cause a lot of trouble for people. In extreme cases, it puts people's lives at risk.
1155	I remember the only country by whose fear Alexander's army was afraid was India. After just sixty years of independence, India is seen as the country to become the sixth member of the United Nations Security Council, and it is also a country with a great development rate. I know that none of us are unaware of the great contribution of India in the discovery of God Partical. Then, from where the matter comes from that India is not having the potential.
1156	Of course India has the potential to lead the world, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower, and the resources to lead the world.
1157	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. Think about this : If the flood of Noah had happened, we would have expected to find the remains of long dead animals and people all over the world. We do not find this at all.
1158	Honestly, I think it's better to try a different option besides spanking, which can affect a child's way of thinking and may make them depressed.
1159	Honestly, I believe that spanking should not be accepted as a method of disciplining a child. There are many options that parents can employ. That is why we have a mouth to speak and say what is right from wrong.
1160	There are some parents that spank their children for every little thing, and that is not right. They will always be scared of them.
1161	Parents should not resort to spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion, it should always be the last resort.
1162	Yes, I would. No one should get away with murder. But, I would never marry somebody that would murder someone.
1163	If my spouse committed murder, I would have to turn them in. I don't think I could live with knowing that they killed someone. The relationship would change. You view them as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse anymore, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.
1164	If my husband murders someone, I will turn him in. It is a crime, and for every act, I have learned that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
1165	I would definitely turn her in. No matter what, murder is murder, and nobody should commit murder. She might be insane and kill me or kill someone else. I would have to live in fear in my own house because of her killing. If I do not turn her in, someone will eventually find out about it, and I could be arrested as well for not telling. It would be sad because she is your spouse and you love her, but I would rather her never tell anyone, that makes my life easier.
1166	Don't be fooled, the majority of abortions in this country are done for convenience. If I were allowed to kill someone whenever it was inconvenient for me, I would leave a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
1167	OK, no, and yes. I think physical education should be education, which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle, not forcing an overweight child to run 10 laps around a track. Instead, it should be showing them that eating right and exercising can be fun. Additionally, students should not feel bad if they cannot run a 5k or do 20 push-ups.
1168	I do not care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have equal rights to a married couple. Civil union, marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation of the constitution, and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is.
1169	There is an argument about whether gay marriage is acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most people in Britain would say it is wrong, however, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love, so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other sexuality, but a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman, and a woman as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!
1170	First of all, gays have the fundamental right to equal happiness. Second of all, they are still part of society. Third of all, the government would have a better image if we allowed the third gender to have equal rights to marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism, and hatred do not exist.
1171	Religion, lifestyle, etc. is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay marriage does not in any way affect your marriage to the opposite gender. They simply get married and go on with their lives.
1172	I believe that personal pursuits are better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others, you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals. Whenever he is already successful and has money, he decides to help others.
1173	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I am more of a selfish person. I would rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I have my giving moments, so it depends on how I am feeling. Right now, I am going to choose the personal pursuit.
1174	I do not believe that he killed his ex-wife and her friend, but this book (which is in extremely poor taste and very offensive) is his pitiful attempt to convince an overwhelming majority that he is innocent. I think he has lost his mind, and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
1175	1) It is protected by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' -Speech also implies expression 2) Desecration of the U.S. flag is currently legal, although recently (2005) the House passed a law making it illegal to desecrate the American flag. It is still awaiting further approval through our legal system.
1176	No, it is not better to always wear one. On the radio today, they said that in the US, 30,000 people die each year for not wearing their seatbelt, and about 10,000 die each year because they had it on. It is, in my opinion, a violation of my rights, but I can't afford the fine either. They are getting tough on the fines lately.
1177	There are Scientology schools where most kids who were raised by Scientologists go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school. There are many front groups that do various things for the community, like Narconon and the like. These groups do not advertise that they are really Scientologists, so it is very possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in a certain school, it is definitely run by Scientologists.
1178	I work with several police departments and I trust all of them. In terms of the city I live in, I do very much. There are some great officers there who are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and backs his officers. We don't have many complaints from there.
1179	The officer and the business owner have both CLEARLY violated your right to free speech! I would IMMEDIATELY file a complaint with the U.S. Attorney General's office, The F.B.I. and your local police chief. I would also contact every media outlet I could get my hands on with the detailed story. If you have the extra money lying around I would also file a civil suit against both the officer and the business owner. You have clearly been wronged, and don't even think about stepping down. FIGHT BACK. I've won 3 lawsuits against the police in my lifetime already, and I'm only 21 years old. We the people cannot stand for this outright ILLEGAL behavior by law enforcement. If you follow the proper measures, and take this thing to the "top of the hill" that officer will never work behind a badge again, and the business owner will be liable for so many damages to you he'll be put out of business.
1180	I say, sentence them to life in prison, and put them in our worst supermax prison, and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. It may not deter anyone, but what will?
1181	It happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. Such as Israel, who was caught breaking the law, occupying another people's land, yet was protected by the US (through Veto Power) and not militarily kicked out like any other normal country would have been.
1182	If someone in my family had to be killed, I would want the person responsible to pay. And if it meant going to the gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. It may not bring that loved one back, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing that he could never do it to anyone else. Thank you for the two points.
1183	I understand the different sexual orientations, but it is impossible for them to be the same person. I may never reach level 4 by answering these types of questions, but it is starting to get less boring.
1184	Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely theGP will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property. Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, exceptions for responding to calls from home and domestic violence. In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet. Good luck and hang in there.
1185	No, we wouldn't have to factor in the unwanted people if legs were kept closed. There are plenty of people who want but can't have it. If self control had been practiced, we would have a lot less trouble with this topic. There are the few that get raped and whatever the other excuses are, but there is adoption for that. As for health, my child has a right to live more than I do...abortion isn't really great for a woman's health either, ya know?
1186	If the minor is under twelve, I would say "no." However, at twelve, I think you are fairly aware of the things you are doing and the effects of them. Additionally, there have been a few murders in the U.S. that were very thought out, planned, and committed by twelve and thirteen year olds. I think they should not only be tried as an adult, but punished as one as well.
1187	The liberal demacrates have made it okay to do all these things. If, in some way, drugs or alcohol became a band, they would immediately demand that the law is "unconstitutional". I heard that they took out the picture of George Washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional". He is our founding father! And they just took his picture out because they thought it was suggesting Christian values in the school. But they teach the kids about Hinduism and Judaism, but when it comes to Christianity, IT'S ILLEGAL to teach the kids about that. And instead of trying to keep kids out of sex, THEY ARE HANDING OUT CONDOMS, and trying to "encourage" the mto be safe. I agree, it's twisted.
1188	First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer, and I used to work for a firm that did liquor license litigation. It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol. It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors. If the decoy just says to the clerk, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime, and it's not entrapment.
1189	There is a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, do not possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case. More life experience and maturity is required when making decisions that will affect someone's entire life.
1190	If that is the entire story, then that outcome is completely bogus. There is nothing wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place, which CLEARLY was not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street. What should have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was not CONVICTED (i.e. innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
1191	The chances of getting marijuana legalized are slim, at least the way things are going now. Banning smoking here and there, how things are cooked, what you can and can't say...we are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
1192	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start then that would be his baseline. I measure changes not overalls. The would have to be extreme for him to fail. Even if his English was not perfect it shouldn't have any effect. Do what you think is right. Have him volunteer for another polygraph from another reader.
1193	As contradictory as this statement may sound, I feel that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination and is necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field is not as leveled as some people may think. Sure, black Americans (as well as other minorities) have come a long way from the old Jim Crow days, but there is a great amount of discrimination that still exists. Believe me, I wish that the policies didn't exist, but then again, that would only occur/work in a perfect, non-discriminatory world...
1194	You need to find a job. Your ex has children to support. How do you expect them to do it and why should they carry your responsibility for it as well? GET A JOB! Said as the ex who is owed a lot of money and know how hard it is when a jerk doesn't pay what he owes. Are you my ex? If you are, they are looking for you..... Best Wishes, Sue
1195	What difference would there be? Violent career criminals will continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders like deadbeat dads, etc. Whoever builds them, prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
1196	First, drugs are illegal, so a punishment should go there. Under the use of drugs an act of crime occurs, which may not have occurred if the accused had been clean. Consider priors he/she may have. Then put together a jail term and a drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence with less time for good behavior. Yes, you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
1197	What is their choice really? Either they do what China tells them, or they offer nothing to the people of China. There is no way for them to improve conditions for the people of China if the government blocks and removes them? Better to sacrifice and be seen, than not sacrifice and be eliminated. People think there is censorship and a lack of privacy here; have no idea what freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
1198	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with a child's cognitive development. It is usually during those years children go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until children are older. Some kids on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time knowing what will happen, or the consequence of what they do. Sixteen year olds are cognitively far ahead of a child who is thirteen in every respect.
1199	I know people who boycott Wal-Mart because of how they treat their employees. They are not like Costco at all. Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its people poorly? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their bennies, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY). Why would they want the related stress that comes with the anger and worthless feelings of being in such an environment so many hours a week? Why would they want them around at all?
1200	First off, you get what you pay for. Secondly, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. I would bump up to COMP and COLLISION as well. I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, and read it very carefully. If you are comfortable, then go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people's lives ruined by not having enough or the RIGHT TYPE of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.
1201	It is certainly not going away anytime soon, is it? In our society, you can give sex away for free, but you cannot sell it. There are arguments about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it currently is. Basically, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want society's approval on it. Would anyone want their daughter to consider it "just a job" or an easy way to get some quick cash? Or would they want their husbands to be able to find no-hassle sex whenever they had some extra cash? How about the thought of your father casually going to a brothel after work? Some might not have a problem with these ideas, but most people would feel otherwise.
1202	The emotional part of me supports capital punishment because if someone killed a family member, I would want them to face the ultimate punishment. However, the rational and prevailing part of me opposes capital punishment because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not...not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown number of innocents sentenced to death.
1203	That depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. Very sad.. Drug use in general is a psychological thing.. There are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness.. For example... many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders.. This is a good example of peer pressure.. Society says, "hell no...lets go out and drink." The problem with drug use is... you are covering one problem with another. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compuslion to use drugs... so yes. I believe in treatment.. I believe you should help yourself... however... one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help.. For repeat offenders... I offer no sympathy.
1204	Yes. If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you want to get off the street, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired. Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
1205	I'm not sure public corporal punishment is a good idea, but there is a lot of crime in this country and it used to be. What's sad is that corporal punishment might work, but it would be a media circus and would then be useless. There has to be a better answer!
1206	Not really cause you did not fill out an accident report and your work will argue that you did it at home and you do not have proof that you did it on the job. Did you tell anyone that your back was hurting before you left work? If you did, they have to sign an affidavit that you did hurt yourself on the job and put your job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too. If you do hire a lawyer, you better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten you lose. So it is best to go to the chiropractor, keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting blackballed from gettin another cause when you fill out an app I don't care what anybody says your ex employer can blackball you and tell them what happened and you won't get the job.
1207	I am not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling is a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit. But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competing companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.
1208	It seems like it, but NO. No one is above the law. If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations. If he has the police and law enforcement in his pocket (that is shameful!) there is not too much you can do. I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible. A BETTER IDEA: contact your local news agency. Expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like this. It's good for their ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully) or at least lose his business licence, etc.
1209	You are probably safe. Not 100% sure, but about 87% safe.
1210	Regardless of race, people should not have to feel like they are just like everyone else because of their race. No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more "diverse". Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin color. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
1211	Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win. You'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding. But if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.
1212	I believe there is a stigma in society toward marijuana despite the fact that usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana. This societal "norm" is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal. Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with.
1213	We've all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online is more credible. I disagree. I'm a neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.
1214	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said, I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1215	I know this isn't true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam (as they are the ones I know most about). I believe that morals should be like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I think that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. For example, Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribed them by their religion.
1216	I would like to hear your ideas on what humanity's ultimate goal should be.
1217	I know that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them? Because of this, I feel like I am actually closing my mind to a lot of good, right-wing ideas. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like.
1218	I would like to start by saying I am a generally positive person. However, sometimes I feel that the world is just one step away from a global disaster. I know this is a very loaded question with many possible directions. But I wish I had a little more hope about the future of the world and mankind. Please help me change my view.
1219	To keep this discussion focused, I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town", considering this factor makes the topic too broad.
1220	If there is high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would there need to be an influx of more cheap labor?
1221	If the government seeks to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. To me, that means that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun. Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder. If someone is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I think the government is partially to blame for allowing that situation to happen.
1222	The usual counter-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge, and knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.
1223	I think the killing of the palestinians in Israel is taking the shape of genocide. By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the palestinian side has many more casualties than the Israeli side. They do not seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas. If Hamas is using their own people as human shields as they say, it does not justify just wrecklessly killing them.
1224	At every job I have worked at, part time to full time, one is not allowed to have any piercings or visible tattoos. Ear piercings are permitted, however, any other piercing is to be removed which I believe is rubbish and prolongs the negative judgment behind piercings that are not on the ears. I understand if the context on either the tattoo or the jewelry have an offensive image on them, but if there is not, then there should be no problem to show them at the workplace. I believe the rejection of showing them only prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, wrongly rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
1225	There should be no "freedom of religion" because religion is a false concept- it's like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference. Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic.
1226	I keep hearing about this as a 'hot button' issue in the media. I believe that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are of legal voting age is a fair requirement. Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for (car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting. Then there are even some that call it discriminatory. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities (IE someone who registers to vote, but doesn't feel the need to get actual Identification.) Please change my view. Thank you.
1227	If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a twelve hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. I do not see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there is no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person. From what I can gather, the only reason we still use twelve hour clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
1228	I honestly think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and its people if it is done correctly by a great leader such as FDR. Obviously it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini, but what about Hideki Tojo? In my opinion he was a pretty good leader with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the Atomic Bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a competent and great leader in control? In my opinion, it would become prosperous.
1229	We see naked animals all the time, and that sex is how most animals reproduce is common scientific knowledge. Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with little to no issues. People are basically high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches, nudist colonies, and swingers clubs is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participanting parties in any way. Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there.
1230	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than that? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intelligence in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?" **Employer** "No." **Employee** "That's your answer then." **Edit: There is no chance for promotion or raise in bar work, waiting or store retail, these are the minimum wage jobs I speak of.**
1231	When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when you begin to judge them. This is because, while seemingly pragmatic, it only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively. Do you agree or disagree, and why?
1232	I would have to vote for The Incredible Hulk, also known as Thoughtprocess' Momma. The Hulk is incredibly strong and gets stronger the more angry she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near-insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) Anyway, back to the subject at hand. Thoughtprocess' Momma (the Hulk) is very difficult to defeat. While Optimus Prime has many weapons and is very powerful, he simply could not defeat the Hulk. Snapilicious!
1233	Excuse me, I am very agressive. I am 17 years old, very athletic, and recently joined the army reserves. I'm a straight A student who might occasionally receive a B+. I'm not retarded, which I think accusing people of being is a very rude thing to say because retardation is an unfortunate thing to happen to any person and there are actual retards out there. I'm entering my senior year of high school, meaning I haven't dropped out. And since I'm active and very athletic, I'm not a lazy fat ass. Thank you very much.
1234	Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One's strength is in its subtleties. It's more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli's realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.
1235	I think we should. Consider this. There are innocent people in Darfur who are being killed without mercy, and we are letting it happen. Consider this: if there was a terrorist group in our homeland, then wouldn't you want help? It's the same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put America in a good light.
1236	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished his term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I'm not a fan of Obama at all, but I can reassure you, we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1237	If you were wealthy, you could live the lifestyle you chose, go on vacation, pursue your interests and hobbies, and live the life you desired. If that was not enough, you could give a large sum of money to the poor, and people would still like you. If you still felt insecure about things, you could hire a coach and other resources to help you overcome your fears, and your friends would encourage you to do good things with your money.
1238	I think the consequences are adequate. People have to register as sex offenders, serve jail time, pay fines, etc. These rules were created for actual pedophiles. If teenagers and younger people who are said to "don't deserve it" are being subjected to this as well, then they do deserve it, for the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
1239	As a Catholic, I must say that it should be illegal. Because in my religion, when an egg is fertilized, it is considered a baby. I think killing a baby and not having a choice should be illegal, and you should go to jail. It might not be against your religion, but it is against mine. If you know you cannot support your baby, you should put it up for adoption. I also think that the government should be putting more money into adoption agencies and less into seniors. I know that seniors have been alive and are important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future. If someone was raped or it was incest, they should still have the baby.?? Just my opinion.
1240	As a brief introduction to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. For those of us who do not know much about philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who do, there will also be a debate within the debate. I will be arguing that we should kill the one person. My first regular argument is that even if you do not intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person), you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.
1241	There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
1242	Could we have someone to take the place of IE? Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition.
1243	"In conclusion, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious "war" in history." The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same number of people killed in a modern war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1244	Love is a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens cannot fall in love? At least for a period of time. Look at adults. Some of them fall in love, get married, and then divorce. It is the same thing with teens, only slightly different. Love comes a while after they are together. I can agree with an argue that says teens are only interested in each other for a while, and then the attraction decreases. The few that stay together after that initial reaction fades. Who is to say that it isn't love? Who is to say that teens are too young to feel that way?
1245	I'm not sure what happened here, and I'm not sure how the slap happened, or what part of the body it was on. There's a lot of information I don't know. But I do believe that turning one's back on a hostile situation like that and noting that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us of a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance. If it were me, I'd like to think I would have intervened. Who can say unless you're in the situation, though.
1246	We have to accept that for a 20 year span starting in about 1985, steroids were common in Major League Baseball. Will some baseball records be altered because of this? Probably. But so what? The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history of baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous. It is crazy to let one person into the Hall because we 'don't think' they took steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
1247	This debate has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women, and here we are, looking at women having to raise children. Children choose in court or in an out of court statement who they would like to live with. If the mother is in a mental state, then who is she to raise children to be somebody one day? Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in, and personally, I think they MUST step in.
1248	I still love the food, but I stopped going here because of the service.
1249	This place is bad. We walked in and no one acknowledged us for over 5 minutes. However, employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally, they told us it would be a 10 minute wait. We waited a few minutes and then they said it would be a 15 minute wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady manager.
1250	This place is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is very good as well and there are a lot of sides. The steamed egg is very good when cooled down. I would like this place to have gyoza or other appetizers. All in all, I will keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream afterward.
1251	After a year, I have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review, I have tried many different dishes and always find them to be my favorite compared to anywhere else. Every time I go here I am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven, and I am begging him to open a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often. Some of the dishes I would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice, and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though. If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat, I highly recommend The Zen.
1252	I was pleasantly surprised by both the food and the atmosphere.
1253	It was a great experience. We had the dinner special which included the Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert, and a side of Mac n cheese. The Beef Wellington was very tender and the presentation was very appealing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington.
1254	I'll start off by saying that this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and had heard good things. We went for breakfast before our train back to the States. I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big. Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid. They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds. Because of that we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
1255	I think it is bad to wear school uniforms because they make you look unattractive and you cannot express yourself enough. Is the band school uniform okay?
1256	I don't think there is a match. FF is more suitable for my needs in every way.
1257	It depends. For example, if she killed someone who deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with them. So, I am not sure.
1258	No, I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse that way. I know if I were to do something like that, she would be beside me, not saying a word. Additionally, if she were to kill someone, it would be for a legitimate reason.
1259	Books are better than TV because they are cheaper to buy, and you do not need a TV license. Books can help you learn a lot, and stuff on TV is violent or not appropriate for children.
1260	Books will always be great, no matter what new technological developments occur. Books have a permanent place in every human heart.
1261	I strongly believe that India cannot lead. You people talk about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd rank of India in area defense and arable land, respectively, but here we are talking about the supreme power. We cannot rely on 2nd or 3rd. Additionally, the people are lazy. They do not have the time to think about the country's development. They are happy at their home.
1262	Well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far...but still, if we compare...
1263	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest population in the world, and the third largest army. Indians are proud to be Indian, and they will lead the world and be the king of the world in every way.
1264	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence and not knowing what he was like. A bad father could come in, gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence, because either way he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
1265	I think it would be better fatherless. The reason why is that I have never had a father. I think that if you have a bad father, you will be taught to be bad just like him. Parents are supposed to set examples for their kids, not just be lazy. What's the point of having a bad father your whole life? You are not going to learn anything from him, so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same way a father can, at least my mother did.
1266	Right now, in my opinion, being fatherless is not a bad thing. Trust me, I went through it. Sometimes I wish I had a bad father, but not having one is better. It's been eighteen years since I saw my father, but if he doesn't care, then why should I? If he wanted to be in my life, he could have been in my life. But being fatherless isn't bad, because I have my mother, and to me, that is my father.
1267	No, when you research Farquhar, he didn't do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away. Instead, he just made a big mess and allowed things like vice, crimes, and gambling dens to continue.
1268	In the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. Now there are child pornographers, sexual predators online. Porn has opened the doors to new crimes.
1269	Even though humans have sexual desires, it does not mean people you do not even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires for the one you love.
1270	I meant to say the creationist version of evolution. My apologies.
1271	I can show you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history.
1272	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving, and the monkeys aren't? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? If it happened billions of years ago, why is it not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1273	You are my classmate and you're 14 years old!
1274	People sit at their desks all day playing video games when they need to exercise. Fat people should go outside and play football or something, and people that are not fat should stop playing video games and go get their energy back. In my opinion, "peace out, assholes."
1275	I think we should have gymnastics because kids get fat and chubby. It's not okay for kids to get fat and chubby!
1276	Faquhar solved problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, he rewarded the people with coins for every pest they caught. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.
1277	There were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people, and the rats also destroyed the food supply. Tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved it by giving rewards.
1278	Farquhar ordered his men to go to Malacca and bring back some food. The traders in Singapore also brought some of the necessities.
1279	It is not yours, nor anyone else's, but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1280	Hitler's mother wanted him aborted, and it is sad that they should have let her.
1281	There is no need to argue. The entire scientific community agrees that evolution happened and is still happening.
1282	Everyone has their own desires, and while pornography degrades women, it is their choice to pursue that career path. If they want to be in that business, it is their choice.
1283	According to a law professor at Northwestern University, easy access to pornography may be the reason there has been an 85% decline in rapes over the last 25 years.
1284	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected in society, then no argument could be made that porn is degrading. Likewise, if we were to berate movie actors, then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
1285	Some people say God is against porn, but we won't know that because the Bible doesn't mention porn, because it didn't exist during biblical times. So how do we know it's a sin?
1286	I believe that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason is that it is better to help others than just think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community, there would be no dangerous places.
1287	Advancing the common good is better, as the Bible states, "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport, where all players have to believe in each other, and not just in themselves. For example, last night in the Super Bowl, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, and the quarterback believing in the lineman. Basically, we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1288	I feel that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do a lot of good in the long run. I believe in the "what goes around comes around" thing, so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them, but something good will also come back to you, helping you better yourself.
1289	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want, some children will be teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms. 2. Okay, look school is for learning, not how you look and dress. Maybe in some levels it matters. Most people that go to school that don't have uniforms take about an hour to find their pants or shirt. I mean, really? When you have a uniform, it takes less than ten minutes to take it out and put it on.
1290	It is a good idea that children should be equal and do not compare clothes between each other. If they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it even if it is not necessary.
1291	It means you do not have to worry about what you have to wear. It's less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear a mufti...
1292	Uniforms will reduce conflict because everyone will be wearing the same thing. This makes it look nicer, and you do not have to spend hours trying to figure out what to wear.
1293	I believe that it is better to have a loving father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood. Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also, growing up without a loving father would mean you can't prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
1294	I like television because you can watch all the pornography you want with your family.
1295	TV can be better than books because TV can show the characters' faces, and action can be displayed that is difficult to decipher from a book.
1296	I'm not saying this because I love the tube, but you get more information than you think on the tube. For example: news, baseball, Spongebob, and so on.
1297	TV is more effective than books because you can watch it in one sitting, while a book takes all day to read.
1298	I hope TV wins because it's great to watch anything.
1299	The American water companies are Aquafina (Pepsi), Dasani (Coke), and Perrier (Nestle), which employ Americans.
1300	Banning plastic bottled water would be a huge mistake at this very moment. More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day, which is helping the economy. Maybe not in a large way, but every bit of help counts. Plastic water bottles are also the most recycled container in curb side programs by weight and by number.
1301	Why are you arguing about a US decision while you're in Canada?
1302	Yes, that is true if they continue to manage the positive and effective economic agenda. The first thing they need to do is to promote their economic policy to every investor and their tourism. Regards, Jerwin "consultant of poster printing san francisco"
1303	India International Institute like Nalanda where students of many countries came for studies..........discovery of decimal and 0
1304	Indian culture, and languages were established 2000 years ago, where other countries are finding their own languages.
1305	Indians have always been powerful, why are you forgetting about their ancient glory and history?
1306	I think there is no doubt in my mind that India has the power to lead the world.
1307	I am sad to see the way this turned out. There was not enough respect and too much spamming. I choose atheism over Christianity because there is not enough evidence to satisfy my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
1308	Notmymuse, give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. I have yet to see one shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. Once you have discredited all evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). Once you have done this, disprove all logical arguments against Christianity. Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. Until such a time as you have done all of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.
1309	There is no god, science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simpler times didn't have to think too hard on those big questions.
1310	No one has ever fought a war in the name of atheism.
1311	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
1312	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
1313	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds, and to be honest, I think it did more good than harm. It's like touching fire, to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job, it may not, but abuse is never good.
1314	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there? Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For an ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1315	I do not believe in Christianity or atheism. I am a Muslim, which is the best religion.
1316	All this debate proves is that the internet is full of conceded, stuck up, narcissistic, atheists who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other people's beliefs and can't leave people alone to worship or not worship as they choose. Atheists are biggots, plain and simple.
1317	Science attests to the existence of God, the question is just which one.
1318	Christianity, because I always root for the underdog. The atheists here are much larger. Just look at the congregations for both.
1319	Christianity does offer hope in the world and encourages others to help the poor.
1320	God helps those who help themselves. So I will go and help myself to the school laptops, then God will help me?
1321	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the last option. I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
1322	Because if the child is young, they do not know what is wrong and what is right. The parent needs to teach the child about what is wrong and what is right.
1323	I believe it should not be done simply to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child so that they will stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because it causes emotional and physical harm to a child. Kids will not learn the value of respect for their parents because they will only learn how to be scared. They will not do the wrong action again next time, not because they have learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them.
1324	No child should be hit. There are different punishments you can give your child.
1325	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she killed someone, I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person you fell in love with. And I would not fall in love with a murderer.
1326	I'm all for the no snitching saying, but when it comes to murder, that's when the line is drawn. Yes, at first, I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there are a few reasons why someone would be driven to kill, but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that, I would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
1327	Having some choices is good, but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in chaos. I have always been pro-life, and I believe abortion should be illegal.
1328	No one has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid yourself of moves away at the first sign of pain without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, because it feels outside your own.
1329	Gays are human beings just like we are, and they should have equal rights to marriage.
1330	I think there would be less control over the masses if there were no weapons. There would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There would be little communes, and then gang rivaled cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
1331	I do not think it is at all charitable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to get financial compensation, i.e. a tax write-off in return. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? Also, why don't you sell the clothing to some homeless people? They have money from begging and can probably skip a meal or two to buy some clothes. (Just a thought)
1332	A good proposal for an amendment for the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. You would still have to be 35 years old and a resident of the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part. Instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a United States citizen for 40 years. This way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here. I think this would be a great topic to talk about in your paper and could easily be elaborated on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1333	They are treated differently because attempted murder and an officer involved shooting are completely different things. If a citizen, as you put it, "commits attempted murder", he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that. If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life, even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent unitl proven guilty.
1334	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account. If this is a court-assigned inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor. Aside from the investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about. You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.
1335	If you are serious, maybe think about donating some to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make ends meet and going to work every day. An elderly person living on social security and can't afford their electric bill. Donate to a children's hospital, animal protective society, or senior center in your area. Lots of things you can do with it. I hope you find what you're looking for.
1336	If he does not have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately. These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize. For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduced or little eligibility for federal student aid in college. Although it is against the law to give anyone a drug that is not prescribed for him, there is always grounds to review this with the prosecuting authority. I urge you to contact a skilled criminal defense attorney in your area. Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer. For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.
1337	Is this a traffic ticket? If it says on the ticket that you need to appear in court, then you need to go. I would not listen to the cop. Unless it says on the ticket that you need to appear, just pay the fine or whatever it says on the ticket. It is important that you follow the printed instructions. Ask your husband. He probably knows the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing.
1338	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized. Let local governments decide if they want it or not, and they can regulate it through ordinances or zoning laws. The same thing goes for drugs. Decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades. There is no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
1339	He is doing exactly as he should. These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue and he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision. He cannot do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved. What more are you expecting him to tell you? He will either agree to represent you or decline based upon the others opinion weighed against his risk factors. And even if he declines to represent you, it does not necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general. It just means that it isn't worth it to him. If he feels you have no case, he will tell you that also.
1340	If that someone was under oath and was "giving himself in" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person. Seeing as how you said that there was a court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served. It would be a time-consuming process, of course, as are any arrests, but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder), then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork. Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow. Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
1341	All these years I have been paying... No, we are absolutely required to pay income taxes! We actually OVER-pay each year, and then in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. However, many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year.
1342	Even if there aren't any minors, the language you use should attract people and not distract them. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who think that they can't be caught. They don't even care to see your reaction. They don't wait for one. They know well that thier answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Moreover it takes some brains to answer a question which they don't have. Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in thier approach. Come on...'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. The ethics, values, etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one can't find them and starts using fowl language. Therefore I advise you not to be afraid of such animals and keep on sharing your knowledge with us. Hope to hear from you soon.
1343	Is it legal to force your religion on others that do not believe in it? If it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child there? Not only is it moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Children are in school to learn, not pray, or learn about God. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to the seminary for an education.
1344	Well, strike the third answer down, my friend. False imprisonment is something that happens more often than you might think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. In my opinion, those states do not have those laws for the simple reason that they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent and "falsely imprison" them. The southern states are really good at that. As long as there is no discovery, the prosecution can hide facts that clearly prove the charged person is innocent. And yes, they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help further their careers down the road. The part that kills me is that not only are these criminals still able to sleep, but the law lets them get away with it and when it is discovered years later, usually, it is too late for the innocent person to do anything to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
1345	Your odds are not good of getting beyond his limits. Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc.. If he does not own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably will not bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage, but he would have to determine if you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
1346	It depends. Both are given due to obvious and extreme criminal offenses. Then, I would really agree with you that the death penalty should be abolished. I'm not talking from the legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another's life. If crime is committed the punishment should be ''corrective'' and something where the criminal should go through repentance. An entire life in jail, made to rot in jail, or made to work, is better than putting someone to death.
1347	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons?
1348	The U.S. cannot afford not to be friendly to China, a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, a horrifying human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. So we can afford to play the bully, assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power, and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-US cheap-sugar-and-smoke satellite that it was for decades.
1349	You have all missed the point. Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information are not covered by the freedom of the press. When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another. When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American people (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole. Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want. It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences. Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He should have been hung.
1350	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely negated in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop legally. Bush is just trying to cover his backside, as well as other members of our government are doing likewise. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government. I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back, too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!
1351	Scott Peterson was the "white" counterpart to OJ. He wasn't famous, he was an "everyman." Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. He and Laci were nice looking, so the TV images were good. We watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was fucking you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?
1352	I disagree. First, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision. Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society that tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created. Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is "more expensive" than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
1353	Be careful. If you continue making sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail.
1354	The concept that people have this right is an ethical question and I support the position that all have this right. However, whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights, including that of information. (1) Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
1355	I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just because of their race. And on top of that they get money for being there. So congradulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
1356	Blame the sanitation workers who fought for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their propaganda. Americans are doing themselves out of jobs. Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers. Where else can uneducated people who do not fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation, and paid sick days?
1357	Marriage is a business, and the license makes it legal. It is there to protect women's interests as far as property is concerned, and for raising children. It is a protection. If you do not plan on staying with someone, or having children, or making property community, there is no need for it. People shouldn't enter into it lightly, and I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated. People couldn't marry for money, or insurance, etc...
1358	No. Any society that values the value of human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system. With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed. Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice. Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
1359	The Church tends to exonerate itself whenever it can, on whatever matter it may be. I don't see where this would be no different. The idea that the Church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it shows flaws, misjudgment, mismanagement, etc., can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfection? To answer the question, yes, I feel it does exonerate itself.
1360	It certainly can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harrassment and the company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it. The USA has laws in place that prohibits anyone from having to work in a hostile work environment. The first step you need to take is to contact the human resource (or personnel) department of your workplace and tell them your story. You need to write down what was said, the date it was said, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it. If the human resource department does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office. If this option is not available to you, consult with an attorney. Be sure to have with you a copy of the complaint, if one was given to you, to take to the attorney.
1361	Saying it with an "a" and saying ith with an "er" is no difference. Think about it, most black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while white people do not. So the actual pronunciation does not take away from the degradation of the word. I have been black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it. (Sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself). I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny". When I was in college, I suggested Not my "ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
1362	Annie Red, I am unsure about religion, and I am a woman. I have yet to hear a logical reason why abortion should be allowed at any time for any reason other than saving the mother's life. Partial birth abortion is murder, by torture. Stop stereotyping members of the pro-life movement. By the way, why do liberals assume that conservatives have been brainwashed into their beliefs? Has it never occured to you that the asker has already looked at all sides of the issue?
1363	Money is not the root of all evil, the love for money is the root of all evil. What this means is that people put money above the Great Spirit (God, Buddha, whatever you call your higher power), before family, friends, all they care about is getting more money, greed. Love is the greatest thing in the world, the problem is people love money.
1364	It depends on the crime. For the most part, I believe if you are grown enough to commit an adult crime, then you should be sentenced as an adult. If we continue to allow youth to get away with serious crimes, then older criminals will continue to target our youth. We must raise our children correctly so they want to end up in prison, but there are certain things that are morally wrong no matter if you are 15 or 35, and those are the crimes our young "adult" should be charged for.
1365	If you have a lawyer, notify him or her right away. If you do not have a lawyer, get one. You should contact the court to determine if a hearing is actually set for Friday. Even though you might not have been served with papers, it would not be a good idea to ignore this situation as others have suggested. For you all, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served. You might have to request a continuance and properly prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you do not show up, the court might make and adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.
1366	Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game. If Youtube were to take over Twitch, they would help with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though. Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel. Youtube could also be then catering to a wider audience. In the past, I've been against some of the things that've happened to Youtube, such as the Google+ integration. But I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Twitch. Just to note, I do understand that Google own Youtube. I'm an avid Youtube user, watching several videos throughout the day, and uploading my own content. If there are any downsides, I want to know about them and put things in place to try and stop them happening to me.
1367	The government is correct to say that teenagers should not be drinking alcohol, but in my opinion, nobody who has passed his or her teenage years should be denied. Obviously, it should not be 18.
1368	In the UK every few years the government's 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position? The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me.
1369	I am not saying all poor Americans are, there are many with mental or physical health problems or an extremely bad start in life. However, the majority of poor Americans are content and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society.
1370	My school has a policy that if there is a bomb threat, the entire school must pile into our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad arrive. However, a smart terrorist could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on their website) and plant a bomb in said stadium, killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. It's worth saving my life 100% of the time. My school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day, so I would know if it's a legitimate threat.
1371	"Public officials" might really be elected, though the process is hardly transparent and verifiable by most voters, but they rarely face penalties for making their bad ideas into laws that others have sworn to enforce. This also applies to the enforcers. If they do experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election. In extremely rare cases they might spend some months in the fanciest prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences. "Public officials" take advantage of ample opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which favor the special interests. The officials then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, in addition to numerous other kickbacks; namely, lucrative "consulting" gigs and the like. Why are most people okay with this? Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?
1372	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. I don't understand why anybody cares. The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there are a handful of titans competing, not a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga, but tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other. People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport. True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team. Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
1373	I've never had an issue with this issue with a significant other, but once in an office building and once staying with a female friend. The argument is that it's considerate, but the counterpart of putting the seat up after use is never put on the table. And even if it were, then it just cancels the whole thing out. And in a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate, in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. Lastly, why the heck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women?
1374	I always hear people talking about how the death penalty should be enforced more often. I am undecided about my opinion on the death penalty, but in my mind, the death penalty is used primarily as a form of societal retaliation. If this is true, should we as a society not want as many people as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to the public about what execution in the United States is actually like. This may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty.
1375	Basically, I think that the public has a right to know about stabbings, robbery, etc. but should not be able to disclose the name(s) of the perpetrators unless it is a matter of security (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned).
1376	It seems the more we learn about climate change, the scarier the picture becomes and the more it seems that we've only just begun to scratch the surface of how the Earth's systems work and interact.
1377	One morning I was in a rush. I had to take a bowel movement, so I decided to multi-task by brushing my teeth while I urinated sitting down. A few days later, I was hungover as hell, and just decided to sit while I urinated. Over time, I began to do it more often. I haven't told anyone because it would be considered "gay" and all that jazz. I also do it when I have morning wood and have to urinate so I can tuck my penis under the toilet seat. As you know, trying to urinate with morning wood can be very annoying. Just because chicks have to do it doesn't mean that it's feminine for men to do it. It has nothing to do with being gay because it does not involve sexuality at all.
1378	I am a young male, 19 years old, but I am seriously considering having rhinoplasty, chin, jaw, and cheek augmentation. I would never say that I am ugly, but I am pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done, I will become dramatically more attractive/handsome. More girls will look at me, and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face (and a strong body, which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
1379	Get over here...the most over-rated saying coming from that desert-dwelling sand wanderer. I'd much rather be too cold versus too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smack them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?
1380	I honestly have a problem with the whole "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever before, but we are able to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth at any given moment.
1381	I am 30, and it seems like for nearly my entire life we have been "at war" with al Qaeda/terrorism through military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors, at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens. It seems to me that the Military Industrial Complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism", so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000 years...). It also seems like a political tool of the right wing, to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people, so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office, to spend even more on Military adventurism. To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
1382	I am a casual smoker. I usually buy a pack approximately five times a year, during times of stress. This time, it was a bad breakup. Am I fooling myself when I rationalize that American Spirits are not as bad as other brands because they do not contain additives? To me, it is just tobacco, so the harm of smoking is still present, but there are no FSC or arsenic, so it is a decent option when I need to unwind, no?
1383	I have been to four methods of schooling. The problem with all of them is that they base their teaching on memorization instead of understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading. I think the education should be improved so that students can pick their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be. For them, schools should take those classes out of the schedule (depending on the class), and replace them with something they plan on having a career in. Also, Economics should be in the prime schedule. Many house foreclosures come from people who know little in the world of economics and rely on other people to manage their money.
1384	If you clearly did or did not commit a crime, your punishment (or lack thereof) will be consistent with what is fair in most cases. Having been through the Illinois Court System, I now know that getting what you want legally is based much more on who you know. It's very much about connections. Connections between prosecutors and defense, prosecutor and judge, defense and judge, etc... Such is life though. The best way to be successful is to have an advantage over the other guy IMHO. Something that distinguishes you from them.
1385	Europe is not a continent, rather it is a cultural realm. There is no major division between Europe and Asia. Some might argue for the Ural Mountains as a barrier if you look at it from a satellite view, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain. Continents are divided by vast oceans and seas. Powerful Europeans just didn't want to be associated with Asia and wanted to be considered their own physical continent.
1386	The impeachment of a president at this time in our nation's history would be disastrous and catastrophic. All of those who believe President Obama is such an awful president must not realize he is not the one who originally put us into such a sorry economic state; if he continues improving the economy, it is possible we can set ourselves back on the correct track.
1387	You cannot (at least in America) legally tell other people what they can and cannot read, write, or listen to, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if you are reading, writing, or listening to a direct order to kill someone innocent, and intend to follow that order, it's illegal. You certainly have no right to tell people what they view in their own homes, away from you and impressionable minds in society. Viewing porn in private is and should be legal.
1388	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how intelligent it is until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient life forms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower it would still be inferior to us. However this would only be the case if we, as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
1389	I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered for the following reasons. 1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over. 2. The so-called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. 3. His credit card was reported being used after his death. 4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon.
1390	I believe that "that's what she said" is better because "yo mama" is just "yo mama" and "that's what she said" has not been around as long as "yo mama", but it is just as clever. "That's what she said" goes with everything and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while, and it is a joke, whereas "yo mama" is more of an insult to people's actual mothers. Of course, there has been a television show on MTV named "Yo Mama" which is nothing but a bunch of retarded people making up stupid jokes about each other's mothers, and they are all different. But "that's what she said" can be said to everything and anything, and it is more entertaining. And that's all I have to say about that.
1391	The United States has no way of dealing with North Korea when China stands behind them. Any action you take, they can counteract. You just have to hope the Chinese can reason with them. After all, there isn't a more westernized communist nation on earth than China. Besides, sanctions only harm the innocent citizens; they don't do much to stop the leaders. Perhaps supplying Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer? Who knows.
1392	Everybody has the right to have their own opinions, to be open about them, and to speak out loud about their thoughts. Logical or not, you also have the right to listen to that person or not, to come back with your own ideas and opinions, or to simply neglect him like he doesn't exist (of course if his ideas aren't logical or acceptable)... It is a form of oppression to tell people the way they should think and express themselves.
1393	Pascal's wager is not the best argument for the Christian faith. In fact, I would not call it an argument at all. It is logically coherent, but does not provide any good reasons to believe. However, it has persuaded some people to believe.
1394	Euthanasia should be available to those who would like it. Euthanasia is a painless way to allow the patient to leave this earth on a happy note, for both the person and their families. Euthanasia can be a way that people in huge amounts of pain could go to and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each and every morning hoping that tomorrow they won't. Euthanasia provides everyone with a safe and simple solution to end human suffering.
1395	Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. While he was back in the States starting his private practice (Trapper John, MD), BJ was with Hawkeye until the end. As the war dragged on, and Hawkeye was starting to lose his mind, did Trapper call to see how they were? No, but BJ was delighting his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and taking over surgery while Hawkeye was seeing chickens on buses.
1396	This is what I have learned from the "convinceme" pro choice debates. Living cells in a mother's womb, though possessing Human DNA that is distinct from the mother, is not human life. The fact that the unborn have a heartbeat and a distinct DNA inside the womb does not mean it is human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does have a distinct DNA, the DNA is human and the cells are all replicating and living...does not equal human life recognizable human hands, feet, eyes, facial features, reproductive organs and formed human organs in the unborn are not human life. I wonder... If none of those things are human life...what makes anyone reading this human? (take a pass on sentient being and souls and self awareness and all the other quasi mystic nonesense that science and the law don't concern themselves with) We have reasoned ourselves away while rationalizing the atrocity known as abortion.
1397	I would rather be deaf because they can practically cure deafness with a pretty awesome device. I'm not sure what the device or procedure is called, but you wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain, and through a series of neurons, impulses, and electrical things "scientific term", you can hear. It's not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries. They are working on something similiar for eyes, but it is much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.
1398	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creationism, while there is massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
1399	The Cold War is over, there is no more USSR, the Berlin Wall no longer exists, we trade with China and other socialist, communist, or dictatorship countries. There are many US bases, farmers, and companies wanting to trade with Cuba which will help open Cuban society as US business take hold on the island along with increased tourism making contact with Cubans. It is obvious that the current political stance is a failure, there are 48 years of non-change to prove it, a new policy should be established, why continue with the same old, same old with no change? Jon Jax 71.
1400	I agree that it is excessive and a form of indoctrination. Additionally, I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accommodate all religious beliefs. The only way to do that is to have a secular Pledge of Allegiance (I do not support any athiestic references either btw :P). Additionally, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
1401	I think the worst problem can be when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things...such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion...don't we? I could argue about the member who posted the debate about being illiterate and how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could posters be illiterate, if they read and write... The person who created the debate obviously doesn't understand that... even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic... but what's the point?
1402	Jon Stewart has a much more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews, and the special reporters he has are great too. He also gets bonus points for being there first. Stephen relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating, and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
1403	I agree, you should state that you get your news from "fox news" and no where else, they make false statements such as labeling a congressional republican sexual predator as a democrat, then never make a correction. You now believe that the sexual predator was a democrat congressman, your reality has been altered.
1404	This is the first time I've ever given a full review, but it's well-earned here. I've visited this location four times since it opened, and the staff has always been courteous and cheerful, the chicken has been fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits have been perfect, and the dirty rice has been great. I've even tried the Cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the box in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick. Make sure you get the "mild" ones for the kiddos. I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and pondering picking up a big box o'bird to share with the teachers...
1405	I was on a business trip in Phoenix and decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning. The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead. The chips were greasy, margaritas were straight sugar with very little liquor and the enchiladas were bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom. You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant.
1406	This place has terrible food and terrible service. I had to wait over 40 minutes for my food and the gate was closed to go to Burger King.
1407	My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had impeccable service and our food was great also. I had the Steak Diane and Salmon Combo, while my husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken Alfredo. I chose to write this review because we witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress literally read her the majority of the menu until she found something she wanted. She was patient and attentive.
1408	We had the Margherita and the Diavola pizza and both were outstanding. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!
1409	This place is not 5 stars, but with a few tweaks, it could be. I am giving it 5 stars because the ranking on yelp will not go any lower. I hope management is reading these reviews, as most people are spot on. Needs: better customer service training for your staff, better lighting for night time sports, additional seating. These things are easy, but will be the demise if not corrected.
1410	Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant, like Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entree of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time. What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.
1411	They are homosexual! This is just my experience... I am not homosexual, but all the kids that are at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
1412	Another argument against school uniforms is that they deprive children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
1413	Kids do not want to wear the same clothes every day. I know I would hate that.
1414	In my personal opinion, school uniforms are not a good idea. Adults are always telling us to be ourselves and express who we really are, but we can't do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!!
1415	I do not think it is a good idea to keep restrictions because that will make students, especially teenagers, more hungry for fashion. It is better to feed them than keep them hungry. And once they are away from these restrictions, we will see the other side of them, which is worse with no morals. Allow people to be free with their personalities instead of stopping them.
1416	Firefox has nothing to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say you are a fanatical zealot.
1417	Mozilla Firefox is more efficient than Internet Explorer because it informs you that it has blocked pop-ups, and automatically updates the older version to the latest version, as well as the Google Toolbar, and it downloads very quickly.
1418	I've noticed that Internet Explorer uses a lot of memory when running multiple tabs, more than Firefox. And probably more; it could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use those as a blind.
1419	All I'd like to say to the wives of people who are on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them you killed somebody; they'll turn you in!" And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!"
1420	While there are benefits to TV, I think books are better overall for learning, as they require more focus.
1421	Television is almost the same as books, the only difference is that you actually have to move your eyes when reading books.
1422	When the U.S. fought the British for their independence, the British wore red uniforms and every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." If India ever tried to takeover the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming."
1423	I think it's better to be fatherless, because even if I had someone to look up to, I'd rather have no father than have an uncaring and bad father. I wouldn't look up to him, and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
1424	I would rather be "fatherless" than have a "bad father", because a "father" is supposed to be the "man of the house" and set a good example so that his children will look up to him. If I look up to a bad father, I might then be a bad person, but if I had no father, then I would set the standards for myself and step up and be the "man of the house", especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
1425	I think in any case, it's better to have no father than a bad father. Either way, you still lose. When you have a father, you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a bad father, then what's the point of having a father at all? If he's just going to be lousy and he won't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life than to have a lousy father figure.
1426	It was Raffles who signed the treaty with Sultan Hussein, not Farquhar, who was just a subordinate of his.
1427	The Singapore Treaty was signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event.
1428	Now tell me these evolution believers how it is true evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving. Also, how is it (for those of you who have religion), that Adam and Eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? In Arabic, makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of Adam.
1429	From a casual internet user, I prefer Internet Explorer because it has a more elegant design and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I am using Firefox though because I do not want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1430	Kids are overweight these days, physical education helps! One, one, one! It will help them realize that health is important for their future.
1431	I think it should be mandatory. When you look on the streets at kids playing, they are most likely overweight because they eat too much and do not get enough physical exercise.
1432	Farquhar did the groundwork to improve Singapore, while Raffles only dreamt about what to do.
1433	Without William Farquhar, Singapore would have perished. It was only because William was there to govern the country that Singapore continued to exist. Raffles left to govern another country.
1434	You do not know these girls' stories, so you have no idea what they can or cannot do. Until you've walked a mile in their shoes, then you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.
1435	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit flies are quite useful for this experiment since they breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations, and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. i.e. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different environment. If you look, you can see evolution.
1436	We were created in a few days or was it a result of billions of years of evolution?
1437	The weak die, the strong continue to breed. This strengthens the species. Argument over. However, creationism and evolution are not exclusive. I do not believe in a god simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a god (or gods) existing.
1438	I don't care if you think porn is a good way of life, I bet you can make a fortune on the fact that all the people who agree with you about how bad porn is are virgins.
1439	No, pornography is not wrong. Maybe some people think it is, but it isn't. If there was no pornography and sex, how would we have children?
1440	Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example, there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit is only for selfish people who only care about themselves.
1441	I think that advancing the common good is better because it helps out the community. However, my personal pursuit will be better because I know that if I do not go to college after high school then I will not go at all, so I would choose my personal pursuit.
1442	I believe it's best to advance towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Most people are greedy, selfish, and only care about what they want. They don't care about what others would want. I believe everyone has a small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
1443	I think it's good within certain limits. I went to school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler, preventing people from showing off material wealth. However, it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed colored socks, which was ridiculous.
1444	It is good to follow the proper school code and the right to express emotions is right, but not necessary as we have come to school for learning.
1445	I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation, you do not have to constantly worry about what you are going to wear every morning. And for that time, you will be doing something important which will help you in lessons. Yes, it may be a bit boring wearing the same set of clothes, but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.
1446	I think that such a policy is a good idea, because uniforms make students equal on an economic level. This can prevent envy and jealousy.
1447	Having a bad father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a bad father, you can learn from his mistakes and avoid them. Also, being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your dad there to lend you a hand.
1448	I believe it is better to have a bad father than be fatherless. I know what it is like to not have a father, so to me, it would be better to have a bad father than no father at all. For some people, having a bad father is like having no father. But in reality, you do not really know how good your father is or how well you have yours until he is gone and never coming back.
1449	It is costly, wasteful, and distracts from the most important aspect of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.
1450	Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution. Also some people sell water bottles that have bacteria in them depending on where they get the water from. Water bottles also cost more than tap water. Water systems are aging and there are hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
1451	Can people please explain why TV shows are more interesting than books? Because at our school we are doing a debate. Can you please help us?
1452	Why would we ban a product that over a million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession?
1453	When the world's most interesting man is not drinking Dos Equis, he is drinking bottled water.
1454	I'm not sure about you guys, but water bottles are so convenient for me. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summer's day and I'm getting dehydrated, and my only option for water is the ocean, which I wouldn't drink from. I have two options: pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick/in the hospital, or drink out of a water bottle.
1455	I apologize if the last comment was placed on the wrong side.
1456	Of course it is wrong. Why do you think that Aids exists?
1457	Is marriage really all about love? I think not. It's about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, commitment, tax breaks, parental roles. If it were all about love, then I could marry my dog, and two kids at the local middle school could get married as well.
1458	Or do you mean that homosexuality is helping to spread AIDS? In which case, gay marriage may help reduce the problem. What is 'gay sex'? I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that UNPROTECTED ANAL sex can increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
1459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. A law requiring separate schools and public accommodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." However, a law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
1460	India has the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states and 28 ways, culture, geography, and language, it certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur, while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically, India isn't that low. For example: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on the Moon. What do you say about that? And the father of astronomy, Aryabhatta was from India.
1461	I am a Christian and very religious, but if this argument is the qualifying factor, I am going to choose atheism. God is not a Christian.
1462	If God loves everyone, then why does he hate homosexuals? The Bible is just a book. Have you ever wondered if the cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good?
1463	After a spanking, I made sure I never did it again to avoid punishment, because the second time is always worse because you were told not to do it before.
1464	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but there is a limit to everything, so they shouldn't use it every time their children do something wrong.
1465	Well, though I behave as an atheist, I certainly do not forget the principles and norms of Christianity. As this argument has heated up, it is better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained that much ground, and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
1466	You'd rather die believing in God, than not believing and finding out he exists!
1467	Because spanking is mostly out of anger, and can be for more than what your kid did. For example, if someone else made them mad, they let it all out on them.
1468	I think parents should not spank their children because there are other methods of disciplining them.
1469	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
1470	You steal a candy bar from school, then your parents steal your favorite toy. The same thing applies here. You hit somebody, then you get told not to hit somebody, then told not to hit, then hit by the same person.
1471	I would report them. That is insane. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime. I do not care who you are or what you mean to me. I would definitely report them. If you help that person, you may also go to jail for the crime as well. And I do not want to go to jail.
1472	Yes, I would turn them in if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone. Murder is premedicated and intentional, so you never know if they will turn on you later.
1473	I would turn in my wife because it is wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong. The police are going to find out who killed that person. I don't want my wife to leave me for a long period of time, so I would tell them. But then again, I wouldn't.
1474	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, the individual that is always involved with the murderer is always caught. I don't want to be the one caught. Additionally, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me, so I would break up with her.
1475	I would say that I would most likely turn my husband in, because a murderer is not who I would want to marry. Additionally, if my husband killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder, and that's not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
1476	Sport should not be compulsory. Many children get bullied in PE because they are overweight or unfit. Bullies pick their victims each day in PE, so all you guys on the affirmative team are wrong.
1477	I am in school and P.E. makes kids unhappy. A lot of people get sad because they are chosen last and can't play. For example, I hate P.E. class. I hate that I'm always the last to be chosen for the teams. It's not cool, and not just obese kids; there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't help anything.
1478	P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
1479	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. This is to cut down on the number of stupid jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1480	It is simply too tiring. That is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory.The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the number of stupid jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1481	Some children simply cannot take PE. For example, some are already in athletics, and they are already training like crazy.
1482	I am not pleased with the idea of increasing the P.E. requirement. First, I think that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. I believe that students have the responsibility to choose whether or not to work out. Also, I say that there should not be any P.E. requirement in college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brains, not our bodies. I add that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as I do. I go hiking and play basketball in my neighborhood.
1483	It is easier to help yourself than it is to help others. Additionally, not all people want to be helped. A person's needs are more important than others' needs; you need to pursue your personal goals first. In this world, you have to fight for what you want.
1484	In my opinion, if you are not helping yourself, you cannot help anyone else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, you will just slow yourself down. Don't get me wrong, helping people is always right. In the long run, if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power, you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
1485	I believe in personal pursuits. It is human nature to pursue things for oneself, not for others.
1486	The person who discarded the cup is out immediately. The person who helped roll the cup rim down should not have a leg to stand on, unless there was an agreement made by the finder of the cup. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and a lottery ticket, do you deserve half the winnings? No. So I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
1487	You need to try and get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospitals billing department. All you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you can't pay the bill and most hospitals will clear the account. That is most hospitals, not all will. But it is worth it. If you have no means to pay for it, then you don't. My father just passed away and he had not a toilet to even use. And I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me..well they didn't, cause most states (if you look into it more) will grant you so much to lay them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his. They have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons. So call Legal Aide in your state and see what they tell you.
1488	Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer due to the poor decisions of others. If you do plan to sue, sue for only the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if you are only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.
1489	You have the right to ask for sole custody. This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order as far as visitation is concerned. If he does not follow the visitation times, the judge will assume that he is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody. This may take some time. As far as child support is concerned, you will be subject to back child support from the day your daughter is born unless he can prove that he is paying. You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents. Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them. The more information you have about your daughters father the better i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
1490	Yes! The effects of "weed" are far less than the effects of alcohol. If it were legal, it would free up a lot of space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime, and I believe it would cause a lot less people to use harder drugs! And people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go through all the garbage they need to now for relief!!!
1491	I am not sure I understand your question. Petitions are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. However, a petition is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that does not mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.
1492	No, God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman. So no, it's not against God's law, but it isn't a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
1493	Ethically, if your father's insurance goes up, you should pay it. It will probably get reviewed within six months. However, the good news is this is just life's lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. She got a ticket because she was half to blame at least. Let's assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father's policy had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. He let you use the car. Now if there is a big claim, he is not insured because he did not list you as a separate driver, and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem, not yours. I do not see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
1494	I can imagine how you feel holding back someone you love. But, I don't think you are. If he wasn't worried, I wouldn't either. His boss needs to get with the times and realize that gays, interracial couples, lesbians, and most relationships are commonplace. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend, he will make a decision to find another firm rather than lose you. Good luck.
1495	I just attended a lecture yesterday that talked about these very statistics. Our crime rate is actually going down, but our rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70's and early 80's. It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution. To really properly analyze these numbers, you also have to look at the crime rates of all these nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point). The statistics for African-Americans are even worse - something like 6000+ African-American inmates per 100,000.
1496	There is no requirement to videotape your FST's. Since most departments do not have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done, and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. Then again, people don't usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
1497	You want to teach this person a lesson, but those are not good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency. So, if you really want to pursue this you'll have to do it out of pocket, which will be obscenely expensive. If your reputation was not in fact harmed then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.
1498	Dear Francesois, I would advise you not to let them do this. A person listed as "payable on death" has no interest in your account while you are still alive. They will only receive any assets left WHEN you die, they are not on the hook for any liabilities -- certainly not while you're alive. Let them know you will get a lawyer if they do not change their tune -- and that it will cost them a lot more than $800. A bank stealing money from innocent children? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
1499	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad, but since she is in jail she can not be doing anything harmful. (In the courts point of view) Fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer. The first consultation is usually free. (and custody battles can be expensive)
1500	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
1501	If you purchased the dog in Florida and you have lived here together or apart for over a year, then the courts in Florida would have jurisdiction over this case. You can retain an attorney to file your claim here in Florida and have her served with papers out in California. If the dog is registered in your name, I do not foresee a problem with you getting the dog back. Good Luck and Take Care.
1502	I am also for lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher. I would definitely vote it back in.
1503	I am not sure if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to specific groups. I know that many people that were born south of the USA may speak the same way because, after all, Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a similar accent. However, let me tell you something: not all "Latinos" are the same. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different from the rest of Latinamerica. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong; when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
1504	The only problem with this form of punishment is it does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Perhaps a combination of frontal lobotomy and castration will do the trick, but I can't see any State passing this into law. I'm more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
1505	Is this your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself? This is what I can think of: Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social "harmony" or "balance." Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance. Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion. The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socially cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is. In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.
1506	The sad thing about this, really there are still a lot of innocent people that are displaced, looking for jobs (which our state doesn't have because of the economy and crime), and have no permanent place to call home. I have a family that lives down the street that lost everything because they lived in St. Bernard parish, and can't find the same paying job in their parish....so they are still living in a pop-up camper. It was disgusting that these people were doing all these things with the FEMA card (some even bought wide screen TVs while they were in the Cajun Dome for a shelter!) Because of this abuse, there are still hard working people out there that don't deserve to live the way they have to.
1507	As far as an actual statistic, I am not sure. However, I think that people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest... I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth... it just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swore to, then it's illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it's probably not going to bother them if they do something ELSE that's illegal.
1508	Yes, fight for your rights, and do not have any sex (charge him, I just had to say that at the moment). The most important thing is the welfare of the children, and documentation. Documentation, documentation. I hope you have paperwork on everything that has happened in your life, and witnesses. He has to pay child support no matter what, he is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). Also, do not question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you deserve it. Good Luck, and I hope things work out for you and your children.
1509	I believe when you get to a point where you can't move to get something or do something yourself, or have a very hard time doing it, you are too fat. My father weighs 600 lbs and he can't even walk anymore, but it isn't a criminal act, although it is one of the seven deadly sins of the bible known as glutiny. No one else can be held responsible for someone eating themselves to death. Cause even if someone else is giving them the food, they pretty much have to feed them til they are full, or it won't let them rest at all. p.s. I am a big guy too, but I am perfectly capable of everything anyone else does with a lot of ease. I work a factory job and work 12 and 16 hours a day and can't lose weight for the life of me, I don't consume that much food. Some people are naturally heavy, and those are the most misunderstood.
1510	Put it this way, if I walk into my house and my only child is lying dead on the floor, and I discover that my beautiful wife has just been raped, and as I walk into the room, he drops his knife and tells me that he is giving up because I have a gun in my hand, you're right, he is going straight to hell that night. Why should it be any different if he gets caught several months later?
1511	This is not an easy question to answer, since in most states, the answer is not simple. In general, a parent may use "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child, but what is "reasonable" from one situation to another may not be the same.
1512	Why don't we legalize murder, fraud, robbery, and rape? Legalizing marijuana is illegal, and just because millions do it doesn't make it right. Millions of people around the world supported the 911 attacks, does that make them right?
1513	I may not know everything, but from what I can see, people these days are too busy to see what Bushy (please do not sue me for using "Bushy" instead of "President Bushy" because I like the name that way) is doing. Also, people are sometimes too poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper (or they're just too lazy too). Here is my opinion. You may not like what I just wrote, but DEAL WITH IT!
1514	Pro. Once a murderer is executed, he will never escape or harm anyone else. It is very painful for the families of the victims that their loved one will never get another holiday, another birthday, or even just one more day, with their murderer still alive. It brings a measure of relief to families. There is just something inherently fair about executing a murderer.
1515	This type of question only reinforces the view of anti-gunners about how they view legal gun-owners. Your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?" Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?" See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a thoughtful discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hostility and open biases into it.
1516	Here are a few suggestions: 1. Don't cover his hate-mongering on the daily news. The whole reason that "church" keeps going is because they get publicity. Complain to TV stations that cover them. 2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your back to them. You have the right to do this from the 1st Amendment, just like they do. 3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia. Support the same causes yourself. I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counterdemonstration and other things that require lots of people and money. Thanks for your thoughtful question.
1517	I'm still not sure why smoking was banned in public places like restaurants and bars. Non-smokers have had their non-smoking areas with fans. Wasn't that enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. If non-smokers' right were seemingly violated, they would and do get their way. What about smokers' rights?
1518	I think because the entire UN was against the war in the first place. Bush made this stupid meaningless war. It was an unnecessary war. Maybe that's why the world is just watching to see the mess the US made & how they're trying to fix it. But Bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake going there & starting this war. Maybe on his deathbed he would. I do agree though, that if all of the world helped, the insurgents & terrorists would be eliminated. But that's not going to happen because I would guess 90% of the world hates the US, especially now.
1519	If you are called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a slut or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck, I mean come on. It's so stupid. If someone wants to be racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
1520	If you are asking for yourself, I would say that is pathetic. You want to sue a bar because you got arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down, pour tequila down your throat, and make you turn into a jerk? I'd love to sit on that jury...someday I hope you can take personal responsibility.
1521	In my opinion, in certain situations it is permissible. For example, if what somebody is doing affects another person or group in a negative way, then the government should be allowed to step in. The government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to, but there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action, then the government should have every right to do so.
1522	I'm having trouble finding anything positive about this decade. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food, shelter, and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively at. For example, everyone is always buried in their smartphone. I can't even enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to film the show. They've ruined every social situation I can think of. Another thing I've noticed is that a lot of people have started to become more accepting of more and more people. (eg, the LBGT community) The thing is though, it seems like it's more of a fad to like it instead of actually accepting them. I know, I'm probably a monster for thinking that way, but it's how I feel...
1523	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything in society, such as wealth, income, education, and so on is just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They do not exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers do not need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusions to make our lives content.
1524	Everyone in school has to learn what happened in the past to argue: we have to learn from our mistakes. But why, for example, are we tolerating dictators when the past shows how awful Hitler was and how he abused his political power? The only thing we are learning is how it was in the past; it might be interesting, but it's unnecessary for the further improvement of our life and society. The only thing I see people with a degree in historical studies doing, is teaching younger persons or writing historical texts. I don't understand why it's so highly regarded, though it's all for our enjoyment. I don't think it should be called as a subject in scientific discipline.
1525	If we stay here for the next 11-12 years, it may end up being a Dodge Charger or a Crown Victoria. It will have a roof-rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front and maybe some numbers in the corner on the back, and maybe the side too. I don't see him taunting criminals by taunting them with his vehicle. I think he will bring intimidation to every neighborhood he goes to and people will drive carefully and slowly around him.
1526	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drive off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus police. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying, but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without licenses.
1527	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the work I think supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no-brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The comments of construction workers don't determine the wage of women, or their ability to participate in American economic or political life. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices?
1528	I know that the frontmen of 90's grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols, but I think they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects. So let's take a look at the frontmen: Kurt Cobain: good looking, blonde, blue eyed, looks like his uncle Eddie Vedder: def above average pretty man Scott Weiland: in his pre-anorexia days a very handsome man Chris Cornell: Not so sure...think he is good looking? Ladies? Layne Staley: I think he is probably the least talented but still not ugly. They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
1529	I watched the Spider-Man movies when I was about six and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. Watching them again ten years later I thought maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on the internet constantly complain about his various faces. I have only noticed the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject, please and thank you.
1530	I'll add some arguments here, but please don't feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten 1. With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. 2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety. 3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term. 4. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
1531	I will explain how I came to this conclusion: I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number. I answered it, and before I could say anything but "hello," I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person. Next, a famous politician began to bombard me with buzzwords which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (I'm not well-versed in law though). I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion, but I really want to be wrong. Thanks.
1532	Let's start with the numbers: Arizona Iced Tea (lemon): 24 grams of sugar in 8 oz. Coca-Cola Classic: 27 grams. Pepsi: 28 grams. Their first two ingredients are basically identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets it from flavoring. They both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona again gets it from the tea leaves. I like both drinks, but I feel at this point that they are both pretty terrible at this point and that they should only be used sparingly.
1533	I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling that Special Education students get one or two teachers who personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.
1534	As far as I can see, they want independence but they want to stay in NATO and the UN, they also want to keep the pound and all of the infrastructure that we've (the UK) have built up such as the NHS, military, police, fire services, etc. My view at the moment is that if they vote for independence they should get complete independence. A full and immediate cease of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, be expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply to join if they want to), the immediate withdrawal of the NHS and other services such as British police/fire services and armed forces. At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, if this is incorrect I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.
1535	I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. In my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.
1536	I am generally against the use of capital punishment for moral reasons for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity. I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I don't think capital punishment is moral for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1537	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes that a woman should have the option of terminating her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act).
1538	I am completely against pirating content online. Most people seem to feel it is harmless since you're stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual company that created the content and deserves the money they worked hard for. The Pirate Bay doesn't even attempt to hide that it's soul purpose is to circulate torrented files of copy righted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is entirely justified.
1539	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." In certain situations it is considered disrespectful not to refer to a person by their honorifics. However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles. Why? Because (1) nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not. (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society. These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
1540	It is not that our generation puts money over people, it is simply that our generation has learned from its past that people are not forever. People die, people leave, people change, and most importantly, people can't always be there for you. Point blank. And when this happens, all you have is yourself, your goals, your hobbies, and your interests to keep you going. The problem is, goals, hobbies, and interests have a cost nowadays. $. You better be making enough to do what you enjoy most. Being lonely and broke is worse than being lonely but making enough to see the movies you want to see and take the trips you want to take. You have to make enough to keep your own life going so you won't stay stuck in the past.
1541	Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add-ons, but its community is just beginning. Also, it was recently rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add-ons. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
1542	Although I believe both baseball and football are deeply rooted in America's history, I believe baseball is America's number one pastime. It is the popularity of baseball during the days of Babe Ruth that all sports strive to achieve. That type of popularity or attention to one specific thing brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite pastime, at least in my book.
1543	I care about it exactly as much as I care about the regular flu, which is to say, "not at all." As usual, simple precautions such as washing one's hands regularly (with non-antibacterial soap, please!) and sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and simply staying home when you feel sick would go a long way toward ending this "epidemic."
1544	By many of the fundamentalist Muslim's own statements they hate the US because we are not Muslim. There is no rational way to argue against that as it is a simple fact that they issue the statements. Whether or not they would be bombing, attacking US interests in the Mid East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of US support for Israel and meddling in Mid-east politic.
1545	I am sorry to say this to all the Giants fans, but this season I think I recall that the Eagles won 23-11. Maybe I just can't remember. Plus, with Brian Westbrook and Donovan McNabb healthy, with their helpers like Desean Jackson and Kevin Curtis, the offense just won't be stopped next season. Also, with their dominant defense, with people like Asante Samuel and their new additions, it's going to be like pick Paluza with the Eagles. Lastly, they have defensive linemen like Jeramiah Trotter and other people that could kill any quarterback they see. Eagles out.
1546	Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to satisfy some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most disgusting act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide). Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
1547	Since I do not believe in the Big Bang theory and I believe God created all per Genesis, I have to say that God created photosynthesis. For those of you who disagree, I wonder how likely it is that photosynthesis evolved by accident. Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident? Things like this make me wonder why we can't all believe in a supreme creator, whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all, at least in the beginning.
1548	Yes, the fix is in, just like in boxing and wrestling. The NFL is a business, and the billions of dollars it generates are a business, and the entertainment is second. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys. Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponsors on jerseys. College sports is the biggest revenue for them, and unlike so-called pro sports, the athletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts, which is why they are jumping to the pros from high school.
1549	I do not understand the point of buying one box and then having an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it. The three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box... making money off of their interfaces? Compared to third-party producers, the three companies very few games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants. I want to see the competition, competition is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.
1550	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees, the poor would not be able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper.
1551	Elvis's music is known worldwide. Even though he has died, his music is still played a lot. You can find Elvis CD's at almost any store that sells music. And even with all this hip hop coming out, Elvis is still being sold. And even to teens and children. Elvis is likable by everyone. And even if someone doesn't like all of his stuff, it is pretty much guaranteed that they know one of his songs.
1552	The processes of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. It shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much more clearly than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
1553	This is a very interesting topic. I think it could happen. Take a look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect they have. When Tiananmen Square happened, there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots, but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these. I can really see how it might happen.
1554	Trucks are definitely more useful. Not only are they more useful because you can haul and tow things, but you can also have the power and capability to haul yourself out of the ditch that you might accidentally drive yourself into whilst talking on the telephone. Also; there are many trucks (such as the Dodge Ram SRT10) that are fast enough to keep up with many cars.
1555	I would like my President to specify where the 200 or so prisoners were going to go instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree. However, with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture and the whole "Its Cuba's property not ours!" business alone, I think the base should stay open. But then, what do I know? I'm only 19 and I've never been to Guantanamo Bay so I don't know the exact happenings of the place. I've never been in the Armed Forces or personally dealt with the terrorists so this opinion of mine isn't based off of much.
1556	I believe it is possible to be afraid of one of the few major religions that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures. For instance: "But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)..." Surah 9:5 or: "O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him" (Surah 9:123). Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
1557	To start off with, I'm a newbie on this website, so please be gentle with me. Saga was ahead of its time, that is why it never really took off like Nintendo or Playstation. Saga Dreamcast was the coolest system ever! And it went CDs before any other system. The Gamegear system was also wicked and before its time. I would love to see Saga make a comeback. And bring Sonic back home where he belongs.
1558	I have had three debates in a row where I have expressed my views on upholding convinceme's seriousness. Convinceme is the sole administrator of this website. What he says goes. If he wants to post rules condemning or dignifying anything, I will follow them. But he hasn't. He has left us as a community to make our own decisions. I have every right to flag any debate which I see as inappropriate or harmful to the community. If convinceme strongly opposed what I am doing, he would have banned me, or at least sent me a PM about it. I dislike the fact that intelligent debates get easily ran over by repeats. It is taking away the seriousness of this website which I have come to appreciate, and feel obligated to preserve. I'm sure many of you agree with me, but only stop me because you feel I hold selfish ambitions.
1559	The credit should go to the troops. Yes, Obama signed off on it, which I suppose you can screw up in that respect as Clinton had osama in his croos-hairs but chose not to fire. But people say this is a victory for Obama, it is not, nor is it a victory for Bush, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, but rather a victory for the U.S military and the American people.
1560	I loathe Vegas but can't avoid it for work. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable for me.
1561	We are staying at the Paris Hotel. The first morning we had breakfast here, the food was good and the guy that served us was friendly and helpful. The following morning, we did not hesitate eating breakfast here again. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful at all. They have dishes that are not on the menu. This guy mumbles those dishes that are unfathomable, gave us a lukewarm coffee and after he served the food, no follow up. The food was good, but the second waiter we had was a total let down.
1562	I have been here a few times and it's very popular, but I can't figure out exactly why. Service is slow, the food isn't very good, and the place is very noisy when it's full.
1563	My coworkers were very excited about this place, so I decided to go check it out. The place has won awards for its Thanksgiving turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable. The food was decent, the service was so-so, and I think everything was a bit overpriced. If you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a "mom and pop" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too.
1564	This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Our food order was lost somehow and after 2 hours, we finally received our food. The manager was very accommodating and comped our meals. However, they needed another $30.00. They had already taken all of the money off the gift cards. So they actually stole $30.00 from us. No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!
1565	The food was great, but the service was very slow.
1566	I like fried fish so I tried it. It was a cheap meal but not very good.
1567	School uniforms are a bad idea. Kids won't be able to show their colors.
1568	Very, very bad. Though I know I'm going to miss the days when I had to wear a uniform. When I was a high school student, I hate wearing uniforms. And when I'm a college student, I miss wearing their uniforms!
1569	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? Because it looks very nice and respectful. It shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school. I felt like a schoolgirl and well dressed.
1570	Great arguments why IE is supposed to be a better browser... Not!
1571	Very cool skins that let me personalize my browser and a built in spell checker, plus everything else that IE provides. Can't beat it.
1572	IE is terrible and makes development more difficult. I simply cannot tolerate creating separate stylesheets for IE.
1573	No, I would not turn them in. It would be too strange for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably not tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them, but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn themselves in.
1574	All TV shows are written down as scripts, which is a form of books.
1575	Books are better than TV because they have every detail in a succinct fashion. We get to read books like story books, fairy tales, ghost stories, etc. These books help us to develop our imagination. On TV, some points are explained more in depth, but in books, if we forget something, we can always go back and read it later. In the end, I just want to say that books are much better than TV.
1576	Having a bad father does not just leave physical scars, but emotional ones as well. During those crucial years of childhood, having a bad father isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it affect self confidence and self esteem, but it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a bad father.
1577	I would rather be fatherless than have a bad father. The reason is that I would not want to know how bad he is and how bad he is as a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. I wouldn't want an alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple: I have a good father or I don't have a father at all. Even though he is still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
1578	I think it is better to be fatherless, because a bad father cannot do anything for the family. Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother. Then you have no meaning in having a father. He creates violance and terror in the house, and you always feel ashamed to call him your father.
1579	Before leaving Singapore, Raffles did leave some plans and policies that were important for the development of Singapore.
1580	Well, the definition of founder was discussed in class that day that founder was not the person who discovers the place, but he is the key in the development of the place and Raffles came to Singapore and established it on a global level. It may have been Farquhar who suggested this to Raffles.
1581	Pornography is wrong because it's not good. If it were really good, then it would be really bad.
1582	Biblically, yes, it is wrong. But, more importantly, it can become an addiction that destroys lives, just as drugs and alcohol do. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
1583	Yes, porn is wrong. I mean, wtf, film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so people can jack off to them. Porn is only here because it makes so much money and stupid people are buying into it. If it isn't wrong, then try watching it in front of your family, friends, or the younger youth. Yes, you would feel uncomfortable. Why? Because common sense and your conscience, deep inside you know it's wrong.
1584	What do you see in porn? Sex, what is sex for? Making a baby, why should you watch others make a baby? Pleasure, what causes pleasure? Temptation, what do you do to control temptation? Then do it... Conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is a temptation to increase the population of the next generation.
1585	You cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extremely dumb argument because anybody who believes in creatoinism who is arguing with anyone who doesn't can say that God makes them think what they think.
1586	IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a secure context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing applications with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
1587	Yes, because some children do not understand anything except physical education, especially rich children of rich parents.
1588	Raffles came and left Singapore frequently, returning after a lengthy absence. Farquar, on the other hand, remained constant and resolved many problems. Raffles, therefore, did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
1589	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation; Farquhar was the one to develop Singapore to what it is today.
1590	William took the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learned Malay, just so he could have easier conversations.
1591	It is not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (have you ever been to Oregon?). Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision to the woman and her God instead of the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
1592	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did I say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So I say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. And the big bang is a red herring. We are talking about evolution, not Cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
1593	Peppered moths is the ultimate straw man. The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That however, doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data VIRUS studies. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotics? They evolve, and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.
1594	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. The fact that they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes them scientific rigor. I would recommend going tohttp://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.
1595	Porn kills nobody. It's a profitable source of entertainment for some. Can somebody really tell me what's wrong with it without bringing their moral standards into the argument?
1596	I do not feel degraded by porn. You do not like it? Do not watch it. There are more important jobs in life than being my personal morality police.
1597	Taking care of yourself is always an achievable goal, but having a chance to better the common good is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You must consider that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses, or simply yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself, and that is the greatest benefit of all.
1598	I think it's a good idea, so the student doesn't have to worry about what they will wear. They'll become more concentrated on their study, so it's more efficient. If someone says they can't express themselves, well, there are many ways to do that. I think uniforms indirectly give thought to how to dress correctly. If we let them dress themselves, they could wear inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans, or sexy clothes. That's not good for their minds.
1599	It is better to have a bad father because when it comes to fathers, they are not only a provider, but also a protector. Almost every father is bad because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father, but think that they had one.
1600	I say lousy if by lousy you mean unemployed, distant, detached, overworked, unavailable, lazy, unintelligent, boring, uneducated, and other non-criminal versions of a bad dad. However, if your dad is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
1601	There are direct links between drinking bottled water and certain types of disease, including cancer.
1602	TV is far superior due to its wider variety of things to do. Some people say that TV is incontinent, but now you can watch TV on a smart phone, which is very convenient.
1603	A picture is worth a thousand words, and TV allows you to see and hear a story or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama, and Missouri compared to seeing them and hearing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. Books take too much time, and TV gives the information much faster.
1604	Without TV, actors and actresses would not have jobs. Without TV, you wouldn't know what's happening around the world. I mean, the newspapers can't fit all that in. Books and newspapers can't give you emergency warnings, updates, or new flashes.
1605	Western Europe consumes almost 50% of the world's bottled water. Many claim that this is due to European culture, since the continent has had very polluted waters due to agriculture and industry dating back to the Industrial Revolution. The water bottles they buy help us.
1606	Craig is a hypocrite when it comes to bottled water and should not be taken seriously.
1607	bottled water is not bad for the world because after you're done drinking your bottle of water, you can re-use it several times to have several bottles of water using less plastic. Plastic is also recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles, so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. It will not be bad for the economy if we figure out how to reuse properly.
1608	In 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and, in return, promote healthier school choices for children. The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception there has been a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Additionally, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians, and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water. (http://www.nikawater.org/bottled-water/ )
1609	The real issue is, why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it. Then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the problem.
1610	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and woman to populate the earth. How can the human species survive if they are only attracted to each other? Obviously not.
1611	Homosexuality is overrated. It's another "look at me" stunt. I think homosexuals are the result of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness. If you homosexuals would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1612	I am an avid Christian, and I believe that gay marriage is wrong. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the beliefs used to make us who we are today.
1613	David, why do people from your country come to India for peace and to get rid of depression? Because we are brilliant and we are actually intellectually superior. In the past, we have led the world and we will surely lead the world again in the near future. Wait and watch.
1614	India has the potential to lead the world. It is full of natural resources, filled with highly spiritual people, and a country with diverse tongues and races. India has the potential to flourish. However, I cannot ignore the fact that the Indian government seems corrupt and poverty still exists. However, China is communist, and poverty is also seen in China. So why not India?
1615	You are saying that only India has these things, other countries do not have these, does America, which seems to be leading the world, have bad qualities? It eats less and wastes more, the amount of food they waste could be utilized for feeding the entire Indian population. It causes more pollution and blames us. What about that?
1616	Intelligence Design theory is merely Christianity masquerading as science, there is no real science behind intelligent design.
1617	Religion has caused many wars in the past. It encourages racism, sexism, and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. The time has come to end it.
1618	I believe so, it should only be used as a last resort, at least because I am one of three siblings and was spanked along with my sister. We both ended up being disciplined, whereas our youngest sister has never been spanked, and she tends to make more mistakes now that she is 10, than we did.
1619	Yes, so they can give the children a reason not to do it again.
1620	Yes, because then they will not do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. However, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross, such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
1621	It is okay for a parent to spank a child, as long as it is not often or they do not use other things like a belt.
1622	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none. So if my religion has no proof, then that gives your religion proof? That doesn't make sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do, and the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
1623	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment such as spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child, and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide, although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know what is best for them.
1624	Some kids do not learn by being spanked, so why waste your time on that when you can always take something valuable away from them?
1625	I would answer in the affirmative. No matter what, you should not kill someone and then say it was a mistake. That is not right. I do not care what others say about whether it was a mistake or not.
1626	I would report him because it is wrong to kill someone for any reason. If he kills one person, then he may kill me. People want to know what happened to their loved ones and that will give them peace of mind that the person who did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
1627	In this situation, it depends whether you knew the victim or it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and I don't want him to kill me either. But if he killed a person that I knew who was harming us, then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and then kills me too.
1628	I would report my husband to the police because that's plain wrong. I would explain, "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So, for doing a wrong and becoming better, you have to take your consequences.
1629	Killing someone is wrong, no matter what. If you kill someone, then you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else will turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they committed a horrible crime and they should pay for it. Basically, no one is above the law.
1630	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to abort or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the child and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to choose and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
1631	One word: adoption. There is absolutely no reason to abort when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is often ignored in the abortion debate, but I think it is the best choice.
1632	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
1633	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault.
1634	Core classes are more important, kids should be more focused on learning, and competitiveness can cause bullying.
1635	Physical education is just another class. Students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in high school. If they are responsible for a car, then they should be responsible for their health. Tax payers do not realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
1636	If students do not have a physical education class, then the obesity rate will go even higher than it is now. That is one reason why physical education reduces heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline, and also stress reduction.
1637	Why does it matter? If two people, regardless of gender, love each other to the point of which they marry, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us? All you bible nutjobes, by the way, are making me sick. The bible teaches love and forgiveness, and let us not forget: judge others before you judge yourself.
1638	Just because they are gay does not mean that they do not have a right to be happy! How would you feel if you were denied? We live in the 21st century! Everyone else is allowed to get married, so why should they be denied?
1639	It might be against the teachings of the bible, etc., but it was banned because a homosexual relationship bears no children. Also, it was seen to weaken the position of men. Time has changed. It is time to accept.
1640	I believe personal pursuit is better because it is your job to decide what you want to do with your life. You are not always going to have someone by your side telling you what is right or wrong. It is all on you of reaching your goals. It is also a good thing to help other reach and succeed in their goals.
1641	I feel that it is better to do both, but in order to help others, you need to help yourself first.
1642	Although we have free speech in America, if our speech incites riots or if it is reasonable to assume that what you say could incite others to do harm or break the law, then there can be legal repercussions. The reason this so seldom happens though is that it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of the words or actions of another, which can be hard to do.
1643	If it is true, and we are talking about a short time frame, then you are probably fine. However, how you say what you say is just as important as the facts. If you chose a hurtful way of expressing the message, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.
1644	It seems like they already don't like themselves very much. They know they can be murdered at any time, and they seem to still do it. It's an issue of being trapped in a rotten life for them. The money they make pays for the drugs they use to forget about what they are doing to themselves. There are some who get out of it.
1645	Strangely enough, in New Zealand, the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people, despite the treaty not being recognised in international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zealand is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally, I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that have been a cornerstone of international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of King's peace. I think there would be an indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.
1646	I think by your name you may be a Marine. Crimes are crimes, and some can be forgiven with hard work and a real change. I am an NCO, and I have seen troops grow up and take their duty and the rules seriously. You can change. Just hope it is not too late, like for Tookie Williams.
1647	Since it has been eight months, I doubt you will get anywhere with this. Not only that you have to prove that they knew about the damage, but the court does not side on just assumptions. If I were you, next time you buy a used car take it to a mechanic and have them look it over and sign off that there is no damage. If you do not like this answer, I would seek legal help!
1648	What you describe is sad, and the system we have devised. The courts are the best that human beings have come up with so far in the history of the planet, but they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time. As you correctly point out, public "pretenders" are anything but helpful. What is important is to not quit, ever. Even while imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, study the law, and work actively on the appeal. Deadlines are critical. Bad things happen to good people, and life is anything but fair. Instead of focusing on what happened, sometimes all a person can do is look to the future and make the best of every day.
1649	The bill should pass. This is a country of law, which should be ruled by law. There should be no way for anybody to break those laws because they want to survive.
1650	It really can't in a common law jurisdiction. The concept of common law is that valid decisions/interpretations by courts are binding authority on lower courts. So, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are designed to do. Civil law systems (such as France, or Lithuania) work differently, and there the court holdings are not binding in the same way as under common law.
1651	I always make sure my checks are not printed on rubber. It's just too expensive and not worth it. We all make mistakes from time to time, and usually it's just annoyance. But if you are worried about an arrest warrant, then I'm sure you are doing this deliberately and trying to defraud the company. You have probably sent them a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to string them along so your guilt is probably pretty well established. You can hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
1652	It is legal, since there is no overtime for salaried employees. However, there is one caveat. The minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees. So, calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number -- if the result is less than the federal minimum wage (5.15) or your state minimum wage (7.63 being the maximum in Washington), or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe), then your employer is in violation of the law.
1653	Web Master has a point. Not only is it unethical, but it resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. But this isn't too unusual. HE seems to make bad and, at that, horrible decisions in the oval office. This is a catastrophe, and it doesn't surprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens. He allows the REAL bad guys to reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
1654	Police brutality exists in the U.S. for the simple fact that they do not give proper screening of individuals before they give them a badge and gun. They give these gung-ho I-can-do-whatever guys who think they can get away with it because they are a cop. Also, factor in the race card because most of the cases are white on black crimes. They fear the black man, so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It sickens me that they allow them to get away with it. This country prides itself on freedom, what about the freedom to walk or drive and not have to worry about the people who are supposed to protect you. Stop Racism, stop police brutality. And this is being written by a white man, so don't think I'm a complaining black man.
1655	Please, it is President Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics, it is the same issue. If it is wrong now, it was wrong then. If anything, there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are screaming about an illegal war, but I can't remember President Clinton asking Congress for any wars he got us in. But you have President Bush, who did go to Congress.
1656	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. The whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home (we followed), but how can you fight it?
1657	The death penalty is not revenge. Instead, it is the punishment assigned a person after having been found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted.
1658	Absolutely not, unless (A) you are a licensed real estate broker and (B) you have a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary from whose interest the commission would be paid. As a professional representative, you CAN seek additional fees for extra services to the estate involving the sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over & above the routine duties of a professional representative, not on a percentage of the sale price -- which would constitute a commission.
1659	That bunch of cells could be instrumental in saving millions of lives, stem cell research. What about my right to live? The best medicine should be available to every body, but perhaps procedures/treatments that arise from stem cell research could be optional. i.e.'Miss Smith you have cancer, we can cure it, but the treatment comes from stem cell research. Would you like the treatment, or would you prefer to die painfully?, and would you like fries with that?
1660	You should get a new boyfriend because he doesn't seem to be able to change or want to change. Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He can't seem to follow the simple rules to get out of trouble. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance and he messed it up. At the same time, he gets caught driving on a suspended license. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face some jail time. I highly suggest you separate from him, it is going downhill fast. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just get out of his way or you will be joining him.
1661	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property. He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business. The government cannot take it away just because he is here illegally. But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he does not pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status. It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes. The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes. So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1662	Not every download is copyright infringement. If someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them. Also, many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in violation of copyright laws. So, there are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used. And as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker doesn't intend or support illegal use to occur -- the software itself is not illegal. But using it to make unlawful copies is still illegal.
1663	The stupid idea of "You can't get an ID without an ID". Try explaining this to them and ask them for their opinion. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction. I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID. So, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records. You request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you.
1664	You are either very young or new to this country. If you have money or are famous, you can get whatever judgement or law that you want enacted. If you are poor, you are just out of luck. Lawyers will not take your case unless it means a lot of money for them. Even if you are totally correct, unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it. So, repeat after me. Money equals privilage under the law. Poverty equals nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
1665	Just so you know, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. They believe that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people. Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
1666	Sorry, wrong, gorgeousleepingwalli. Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. (You have to actually read the stuff you Google before you jump to a conclusion and post an answer here.) Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/42...64 years ago today...good question considering the date today...
1667	If the judge couldn't hear her clearly, then he has every right to ask the woman in question to remove her veil. If the woman, who is a lawyer, could not be understood in court, then she is not doing her job properly, and the judge cannot do his job properly either. I can only respect him for asking the veil to be removed, it isn't for very long, and she was fighting for someone in court!
1668	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights, but I do believe that they should be treated as human beings. If they cannot be peaceful, then they should not be allowed to walk the streets. If they cannot be reformed, and they continue to be disrectful, no government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives, and as well as tax dollars. I wouldn't think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! It might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
1669	I am not sure, but ask if there is a youth court or teen court system you can go through. Those are systems where teenagers learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, and sometimes even judges. Typically, if you go through teen court, you end up doing community service and the offense doesn't stay on your record. My one preachy moment: drink if you want to drink, but don't ever ever ever drink and drive. It's moronic and inexcusable.
1670	It is not the reaction times -- it is the crime itself you are punished for.
1671	The laws need to be changed so that parents can't just throw in the towel and leave with the kids. If they want to leave without a judgment that the spouse they are leaving is dangerous, an adulterer, or mentally ill, then they should leave empty handed.
1672	There are several rules governing what you can and cannot do to the flag. Check the link below to see them. FYI - Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a "fan". He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn't vote for him?
1673	I understand how you feel. You have said that you believe you are in love with him, but you haven't said anything about the other woman he is with. If I were you, I would try to steer clear. If he manages to end his relationship with the other woman and keep his relationship with the kids, then maybe you could think about him again. I don't know about the law and deformities, but I would say no to both questions, but just think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect them. It's tough, I know. Good luck.
1674	I think you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are talking. Marijuana seeds don't fly out of birds. Any idiot knows what weed looks like just from the leaf. Yes, you can get in trouble for cultivation, but not that much if you only have one plant and claim you don't know what it is. They won't believe you anyway. You won't get caught, if the cops find out, then your friends really aren't your friends.
1675	Using illegal drugs is a crime, no matter your condition or sex. However, a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her child to illegal drugs or alcohol. Sure, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the child is born, then she should go to prison. The problem is, who will pay for that? That's right, the taxpayer. Accountability is the number one lacking quality among many Americans today. The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibility is enabling these morons to continue making poor decisions, having children, doing drugs...etc. Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Good luck and take care.
1676	Not likely. Even with the new Chief Justice and Associate Justice, it is not likely that the court will change existing precedent. Hopefully, though, the court will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term abortion, require parental notification for teenagers, and will require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.
1677	Why not? People complain it is against God. So those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway, marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even an atheist. What's the big deal? After all, isn't it their God's job to judge them? And to punish? They do believe their God gave them "free will", don't they?
1678	I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD makes you not focus easily, but when you do, you hyper focus, grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math, science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be their own unique awesome person, advancing humanity towards the next step in our history. Please CMV!
1679	Saying you belong to a political ideology makes you dogmatic. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard.
1680	I am in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow. It costs between $30,000 to $800,000 to transplant my marrow, which I am giving away for free. While I am on the list, I would jump at the chance to sell my liver. The medical industry is making money hand over fist, and I want a piece of it. If women have the "right" to abortion because of their "right" to bodily autonomy, I should have the "right" to sell my marrow and organs.
1681	I think the proof is in the pudding: take something you consider yourself truly knowledgeable about and look at the news coverage. You'll find it partial at best. You'll encounter people who "read an article" related to your field and understand how naive they sound. Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layman a foothold in the subject matter. This isn't to say that news isn't valuable. But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, have never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact, it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.
1682	Of course, stop if there is a train. I think of this every time I see a truck/bus with "This vehicle stops at all railroad crossings" written on the back... I feel that stopping, listening for a train, and then going again is much riskier than not stopping at train crossings. I have three reasons: 1. If your engine stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety. 2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it. 3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk. I think that the safest option is just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road. CMV
1683	Lobbying is prohibited. No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine. - Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means. The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question. This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate. I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only five minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also not American, so I do not fully understand how your political system works. I hope this doesn't sound too stupid.
1684	I feel that a person like me is not really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sort. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
1685	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney when they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was Lion King. The characters and songs weren't anything more special than any other Disney movie either. I believe that the people who proselytize about the movie are mostly the ones who watched it as kids or young adults looking through nostalgia colored glasses. People who's first exposure to a real and dramatic story was Lion King, so they came to believe that it did something unique or special (when it really, really didn't).
1686	I understand that the main dissenting opinion is that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a long time people have been buying scratch-off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
1687	I work downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who defecated in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think they should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way the major downtown areas could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work, and it really hurts the local economy.
1688	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur approximately 2 hours prior to the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund or the option to change bookings to a later date. I now have concerns about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same amount. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.
1689	Bungie's next game looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it's going to be such a revolutionary game. Frankly, it looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But otherwise, it's a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary? I mean the setting looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the revelation of the ships not being flyable and there being no space combat -they're just cut scene machines- was a big disappointment for me. Please, I want to be more excited for this game than I am. But it's being hailed as the next big new thing in gaming and I just don't see it.
1690	I am a Canadian by birth, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I found this to be a good thing, and I clung to it myself for a time, but I have discovered that it does not lead to bigotry and stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. Why can we not accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as "losing" our identity? The fear of losing this causes people to be ignorant and bigoted.
1691	I believe kids owe their parents everything, because their parents brought them into this world and gave them life and fed them, sheltered them, and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay at home (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can drop what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives. I believe kids don't know what they're doing, ever, and that parents always know better than their kids.
1692	Men such as myself, don't have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about are things that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of "oppression" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued.
1693	I think the Japanese need to protect themselves a lot better against China. The Chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military, and I'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities committed by the Japanese in WW2. And the Japanese won't even acknowledge the genocide in the same way Germany does with the Holocaust, that's just rubbing salt in the wound. On the other side, I know Japan is being protected by American forces, but how much can they trust the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? (Or South Korea for that matter) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
1694	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill "race quotas" to "diversify the campus" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one. The intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning, aimed at helping needy students. However, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
1695	I understand that the Democratic Party collects the most money from super PACs. I understand that union dues are low, and the Teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a good democratic check on the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1696	I'm not sure what the popular view on reddit is about this, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought. I don't really think it matters because the founding fathers were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything, they were just people. We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like they were infallible. I'm not saying the founding fathers were always wrong, but I don't think a view deserves any more merit just for being the view of one of the founding fathers.
1697	I have long struggled with this and I'd like to hear some strong arguments from the other side.
1698	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is a healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said, I have nothing against someone for being overweight.
1699	So creationists like to argue that evolution is wrong and creationism is correct. Yet the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth, which moves at 1 mph or less, manage to outright and outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous and that the flood never occurred.
1700	Reality TV is garbage. First of all, it is scripted. Just meant for amusement. It is not really reality. People live vicarously through reality TV shows. Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative way. For example, The Bachelor teaches our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy-tale wedding. That is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as Rock of Love, Flavor Flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.
1701	I am embarrassed to be ignorant on the status of this project so perhaps some of you kind souls can fill me in. I'm wholly convinced that a useful stipped-down laptop can be manufactured for less than $100. When traveling, I was always issued this super-handy Asus EEE which cost about $300. I'm also wholly convinced that access to information infrastructure is an essential part of nation-building, but Microsoft Powerpoint is not. (In fact, that inspires a new debate topic!) Perhaps somebody can clarify for me, will these laptops have access to the internet?
1702	Yes, friends come and go throughout the year, but my family has been the most constant presence in my life. We share the same blood, look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
1703	I'm not sure if the creator of this debate had a specific event in mind when they posted it, but I'm willing to take part regardless.
1704	I would say before. I have never been married, but I have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw. As far as sex goes, it was much better in the beginning of a relationship, when your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/different. After a long time, having sex with the same person, the quantity and quality both began to decrease. It seems after a long time, it seems like a routine with less experimentation. I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on, not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1705	The better question would be: Why can't we admit it?
1706	Death should be celebrated as an integral part of life. The empty casket is a reminder of what the person was, not who they are or even who the deceased was to those around them. Funerals are reminders that the dead will no longer be who they were to those who survive. It is selfish, celebrate the dead, everything about them, remember and be happy. Do not mourn over your loss, celebrate their life.
1707	We are not talking about killing for fun, rather about putting the animal out of its misery, so your argument isn't relevant. What we are saying is that with animals, it isn't worth much to put a sick animal through an ordeal just so its mate won't pine for it. With humans, the case is different. Besides the emotional trauma which is much more complex in a human than in an animal, seeing as we r much more complex beings, humans bear a responsibility to those around them, their wives and especially kids who depend on parents not only for food, but for education among other numerous things. Reptiles, on the other hand, desert their offspring as soon as the eggs hatch. A snake will eat its own eggs if it can't find the food.
1708	I'm not sure you can. Since video games and movies are all we really have to go on, is it truly possible to kill that which is already dead? We don't really know. I think that if something possessed the undead, I wouldn't think we could kill them off since they are dead to begin with, and not able to be killed by our normal means.
1709	Yes and no. Art is art, and that is true. If it is in the correct area, such as in your neighborhood, nightclub, etc. It's part of the culture and a good thing. However, no because if it is defacing public buildings, historical sites, bridges in public areas, and otherwise beautiful landmarks of the city, it is wrong. Those things are intended to look professional.
1710	Runes were discovered magically after Odin hung from Ygdrassil, the world tree, for nine days. In his agony and delirium, he saw visions of runes on the ground below him. Runes were originally symbols with magical properties, and later they evolved into a kind of writing system. The Iranian writing system of today (not sure what its actual name is), the characters look incredible and I think that that writing system is the most beautiful modern writing system to look at.
1711	Animal testing should be allowed under strict conditions until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. They should not use animal testing for products such as make-up or perfume. However, if they are testing a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal testing is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
1712	Absolutely not because everyone's sense of morality is different. Thus, for example, if a pro-choicer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they want but still not change the fact that the pro-choicer has valid points. Indeed, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective and thus saying that someone "lacks morality" is about as valid an argument as "you suck".
1713	Isn't helping a little better than not helping at all? And if I'm going to buy an iPod anyway, isn't it better to buy a red one that gives a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that fits better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple? Gestures like those ridiculous Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy (read: NOT a stupid-looking rubber bracelet), I think that having a philanthropic option is refreshing--even if it's just a LITTLE philanthropic. The previous options weren't at ALL philanthropic. If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's, well, a little better.
1714	Bad Company is boring, the controls are weird, the vehicles are boring and hard to control for some reason, and the maps are too big. On cod, the map called "Wastland" is one of the biggest and people hate that map.MW2 is very intense because it keeps you wondering what's about to come from around the corner, or if a sniper is up in a window or hiding on a roof ready to put a bullet in your head, or if you're about to get hit by a thrown grenade. Through all that that goes through your mind as your playing, you get hit from behind and your down.Battlefield is boring because you always know where the enemy is and you don't have to go get them, you can just drive around being bored and the maps are to big to go out of your way to kill someone, unlike on MW2 you're thrown into the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to develop.
1715	School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we wouldn't notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
1716	The casino just rips everything off so they flood the mall parking.
1717	The food was ok, the portions were huge, but I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
1718	This place was a last minute find and it was not what I expected in a big way. The sushi was delicious and fresh for our group of 10. The service was great and the location is great for the action in Vegas.
1719	I would recommend that you try Vietnam Grille, located on South Blvd., right off the road. It is a popular, clean restaurant. Yesterday, the weather was windy, damp, and cold, which was perfect for Pho. We ordered some Crispy Spring Rolls and #26 -- Beef Pho. The Spring Rolls were delicious and the sauces on the side of the table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The Soup arrived -- Huge Bowl! Filled with a delicious broth and noodles and beef and then all the extras on the side to add, the bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious. You have to try it. I will be going back again and again!
1720	Our waiter was great, very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal. I was very disappointed in the food.
1721	This is a great place for sub sandwiches. The ingredients are always fresh, and the bread is always soft. The staff is very friendly and they always make the sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I have had issues with them asking me to add cheese to my order on more than one occasion. I then pay for the sandwich and then when I get it, there is no cheese.
1722	I am sad to say I did not have a good experience at Caffe Boa. First off, let me say I did not taste any food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress- she would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat and sat. We were never greeted. Not even a water. We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes. Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater.
1723	Schools should not create dress codes. On the one hand, yes, uniforms help students focus more on their work. On the other hand, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school. Kids are highly impressionable, but they are allowed to have their own creativity. Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.
1724	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is that it will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school does not want the children to show, and the students would not be concerned about what they are wearing.
1725	Compared to civil dress, school uniforms are futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
1726	the number of reasons why FF IE is terrible.
1727	One feature that convinced me to buy is TABS, which is what IE copied in version 7.
1728	I don't have a definitive "yes" or "no" answer, as it depends on the circumstances. If things got out of hand, and the police knew it was my boyfriend who committed the crime, and they had all the evidence and witnesses to prove it was him, then I would turn him in. If they knew it was him, then it was only a matter of time.
1729	No, I would not turn in my spouse. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But I don't see it as my place to go and turn him in. It also depends on the reason for him killing someone. It can't be some random killing, because I would turn him in for that. For the fact that I would think that I would be next to get killed.
1730	It depends on what happened. She would have to tell me the story, and I would have to be able to empathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful, and I could empathize with her about why she committed murder, then perhaps I could forgive her and not turn her in.
1731	Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1732	I am too old to start dating again. Besides, you do not specify who she killed or why. Maybe she killed for reasons other than living.
1733	I would not report him unless he killed more than one person because there is no way it was an accident more than once. I think if I loved the person enough, I could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
1734	I could go on and on about books like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles. There is very little that compares to the world described in books.
1735	Books are cool, TV isn't. Books are for nerds, TV is for people with different tastes. I think Black Ops is better!
1736	Books do not harm your eyes like TV does. Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. Reading books often can help with spelling. Reading books often can help you write better.
1737	It is better for young kids who have school work to do, and it is healthier for their eyes. When kids need to do their homework, they need to do more reading than watching TV.
1738	I think India is not ready to lead the world for many reasons. First, our politicians are involved in black money cases. They try to gain or earn money as possible. Second, they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. For example, if a politician says something about another politician, they try to make it a big issue.
1739	No way! Get out of here! China will dominate, if not, the US will. India will never get the chance to ruin the world!
1740	This debate is ridiculous. No, they don't. They're practically a 3rd world country.
1741	India does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians, numerous religions, fighting between various religions, and a lot more.
1742	He has a boss (Raffles)... he has to follow him and not go about doing anything else.. if then why can't Farquhar help Singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, and effort are all invested. You must know people who would help you.
1743	On 28 January 1819, Raffles came to Singapore. He saw the good location of Singapore and he signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company in February 1819 to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement.
1744	Adrian Peterson, are you my husband? If you aren't, then I'm sorry. Your name and your speech have me convinced that you are.
1745	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality of life, and thus increase one's maturity, and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. Porn is definitely wrong. After a dosage, the guilt of wasting your time, wasting energy, wasting effort, not devoting yourself to another thing, and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. Trust me. It is a road that should not be taken, it is as bad as smoking and drug use. I think the only reason it is not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
1746	Pornography is wrong, mainly because they are not doing it right. In three years, it will be in 3-D.
1747	You are as brainwashed as I am, except you are on the other side.
1748	From a casual internet user, I prefer Internet Explorer because it has a more elegant design and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I am using Firefox though because I do not want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
1749	Physical education is a waste of time and should not be taught in school.
1750	Crimes like robbery and fighting often occurred, so Farquhar set up a small police force.
1751	Farquar dealt with everyday problems during the early years of Singapore. He also attempted to know the people and understand Malay, whereas Raffles hardly communicated with the people.
1752	Your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
1753	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need for illegal abortions while killing oneself.
1754	This is a common view of the creationist argument. None of what Sean said has anything to do with science. This is a theological view of the world. I understand if you are religious, just don't try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology.
1755	Is porn wrong? Absolutely not! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you do not believe in it, then do not look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether you are the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice.
1756	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response will be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." Ultimately, people do not help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it.
1757	In my opinion, putting the common good first is preferable to putting your own interests first.
1758	Even though your father may not be the best or always there for you, he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with their children, which shapes and molds a son or daughter's character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are, even if they are not ideal.
1759	For example, me. I grew up without a father, and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or having a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because, honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your father and you have nothing to say. Whether he is bad or good, a child should always be in touch with their father. Even if he isn't with their mother anymore.
1760	I would rather have a bad father than be fatherless, because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is, rather than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I were to grow up without a father, I would grow up with an emptiness inside me.
1761	Water bottle usage is not worth making the environment worse than it already is. These bottles will not start to decompose for another 700 years.
1762	People drink water every day, and are oblivious to the fact that they are polluting our planet.
1763	The high price of bottled water is not the water itself but the cost of bottling, packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing, and transporting it around the world.
1764	Water bottles, are they good or bad? Many people believe plastic water bottles are good, but the truth is they are polluting land and unnecessary. Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergencies. The water in those plastic bottles is only filtered tap water. In an emergency situation like Katrina, no one had access to tap water. In an emergency like that, water bottles are good because they provide people in need. Other than that, water bottles should not be legal because they pollute the land and big companies get 100% of the profit.
1765	Sheep count him to fall asleep. He won the 1995 World Series of Poker using only one card.
1766	Plastic can kill many types of fish species. There have been 26 pieces of fish found in one single fish. Fish are vital to the environment as a food source for birds which eat bugs, therefore the cycle of life.
1767	Unless the brain is used, no human being can understand any medium, be it TV or books. By watching TV, people can create a make believe situation and think, "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?". Furthermore, we can watch TV in the dark, while to read a book you need the lights on, which also wastes electricity.
1768	I think television is more helpful as you can watch and listen to something being explained. For example, when we read about budding or spore formation, we have to create an image in our mind of what that is, but when we watch the animation of budding, we understand better. Some people can't even imagine, so television is helpful. As for time limits or harm to our eyes, we should watch television in moderation. Excessive reading, listening, and watching can be harmful. Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he has read, and 50% of what he has listened to and watched.
1769	People who are against TV keep saying that it causes obesity. I'm not going to go for a run and bring a book to read along the way. I think it is much easier to exercise watching TV than reading a book. In gyms people do not have books in front of them. Instead they have televisions, and studies have shown that television is even more stimulating than books.
1770	Yes, I would say it helps you relax in case you're tired, but you can also read to relax as well. Additionally, have you ever considered the commercials and how annoying they are?
1771	Marriage evolved because of moral and religious reasons, rather than a mere union approved by the state. To degrade marriage just to accommodate base desires of gay couples in disguise as a right is simply stupid.
1772	I believe that India is rapidly emerging as a hub for international trade and investment. India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automobile, tourism, and banking among others. Almost every multinational company is focusing on India.
1773	Christians are also fun to laugh at because they spend half of their Sunday going to church. What a waste!
1774	I find most religions to be ridiculous and illogical. The only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers, at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for. I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. It allows for more logic in my mind.
1775	Ever since recorded history, people have believed in sky spirits for which there is no evidence.
1776	I think you should hit your kids if they do something really bad, like wreck your car or steal, you need to hit them so they know they should not do that.
1777	Yes, because if they fear getting hit, then they will not do it again.
1778	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child does not follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1779	I think spanking should be used if it will teach the child in the long run. However, each child responds differently to different punishments. While one child responds well to just telling them no or grounding them, another child may need a spanking to teach them right from wrong.
1780	I believe spanking is an effective way to punish a child if nothing else works.
1781	I support this because I was spanked as a child and turned out to be a good daughter. Being spanked teaches you not to do it again and to be scared of doing it again.
1782	I would also like to point that atheism predates Christianity. Your "test of time" argument is not credible.
1783	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline their children. It only makes the child angry, rather than seeing what they did wrong.
1784	No, spanking is not the solution to your problems... you should talk to the kid with love and understanding, so they can understand they are doing wrong.
1785	Yes, I would turn her in immediately because if she did something like that, then she is a little crazy, loCo, insane in the brain, and I am not trying to be her next victim. Murder is a murder, and it's illegal and not right.
1786	I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me, that would be too crazy. Taking another person's life is never the solution, nor is it acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
1787	Murder is a crime that cannot be overlooked. Sleeping next to a person who has committed a crime, and you knowing about it, makes you as responsible as that person.
1788	There is no excuse in the world for killing a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. If the woman was raped, it is not the baby's fault. The woman with the baby, whoever they are, should speak for the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
1789	I really dislike Physical Education because I have to run so much and I hate it.
1790	P.E. doesn't help fat kids. The fat kids just eat too much, or they are growing, and eventually they will be normal.
1791	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might satisfy them, but they will still not be satisfied. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, then law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
1792	If they want to marry, let them. If they were your child or adopted mother/father, you'd accept it!
1793	I think I will go with personal pursuit because no matter what we do we think of ourselves first. I think it is human nature. However, personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself. I need to think about myself first and succeed, then think of others.
1794	Our animal instinct is survival. It's what makes us flinch when we see something coming at us. It makes us react faster. In today's post-modern world, our instinct has changed to keep obtaining money to keep us alive. Times change, but our desire to survive above others is still thier.
1795	I believe pursuing personal goals and interests is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
1796	Well, for me, it's a 50-50 split. I believe that we should all be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good." But, on the flip side, we live in the real world and do things that are better for us. For example, in your job, you're not going to try to make another employee happy; you're going to try to make yourself look good so that you can get more money.
1797	I think personal pursuit because I believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals. How can you help others if you don't help yourself? Helping yourself first would make you a better person, and I think that after you achieve your goals and become a better person, you will be able to help the common good.
1798	He is a convict, she does not have much to worry about legally. There is almost no chance (almost...) of her being brought to trial on a perjury case, but he might be able to do something in civil court... honestly, if she has a new car, she should give the car in question back just because it won't be worth the hassle. Remember it's up to the district attorney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he's not likely to get involved in a family dispute like this... Even in the very obscure possibility that the DA did even consider the case, he would not prosecute for one very good reason. The case would be based on one thing, the word of a convict against the word of your niece, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.
1799	I think if we expect law enforcement to do a certain job, then they should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program, if there were more people out there doing it, there'd be less demand for police, etc.
1800	I do not think there are any victimless crimes, by definition. We might ask why particular laws are enacted because they seem to have no negative effect on an individual, group, or society as a whole. However, you need to consider the full effect of the action to determine if there is any harm to society. For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working on a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate. Similar considerations would apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
1801	Yes, it is illegal in the USA. However, the person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medication (in this case from India). The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life-threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. But for other drugs, I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds). If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale. Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.
1802	Although the previous answers are correct, you should pay your rent because of your contract, I would advise that you hold on to that rent payment and do not pay him. He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook, you will not see the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money) You're moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal proceedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc) So, I say sod him!! Good luck x
1803	I went to Prague, and they are much less uptight about sex in general. The local bar had strippers, and you could have an escort arrive at your door within minutes if you desired. I do not think that is true, though. They are not that bad, I do not think. I found it a bit seedy, but then I am not into that kind of thing as a girl!
1804	To set a uniform standard. Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by.
1805	Yes, the government already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients, and they can tax it to bring this country out of the deficit. Besides, how many people do you see die from pot-related accidents? None. They're only doing 10 miles an hour. You can't kill anyone at 10 miles an hour. Canada has a man named Mark Emery, who is known as the "Prince of Pot." He has brought the country of Canada so much money by selling pot seeds that they have no debt. Plus, the U.S.A. wouldn't have as many drug-related crimes, and if it helps sick people to ease the pain, then I'm all for it. With the pain Busch & our government put the American people through, we need something to help us cope.
1806	I believe that guns are bad and should only be used by law enforcement and not ordinary citizens. I lost my brother to an accident involving a gun, and knowing that just anyone nowadays (depending on where you live) can purchase a firearm without even obtaining a license in some cases makes me shudder with frustration and disbelief! I've recently seen a report on the TV news that claims that even owning a fake gun such as the now-famous 'paint-ball guns' can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them... Let's leave guns in the hands of those who know how to use them in order to protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!
1807	I am surprised you are consulting a lawyer on this one. It would cost you too much. This is exactly what small claims is designed for -- someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers should not be involved. Sue. On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief. Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name. Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you. Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one of these two remedies, possibly with interest.
1808	I checked the statute and it says that the county can seek reimbursement "for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail." However, the statute is clear that a conviction is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the county cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to jail, then you must pay. If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served," then the county can seek reimbursement. If you sat in jail for four months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
1809	Lawyers are motivated by a combination of money and power. Without legal disputes, such as in civil matters, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers.
1810	Civil marriage is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is, therefore, controlled by the government. I do not think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage. If you find a church that agrees to, you can have a wedding ceremony to whomever or whatever you like, but only the government can decide if it is going to recognize it.
1811	No, there are many programs designed for felons to get their life back on track. You may be able to go back to school, depending on your desired field, and get the taxpayers to pay for it. You should go to your local DHS or CPS office, and they will be able to refer you to where all of that information will be available for you. Good luck!
1812	That video, as well as many others on that subject, can be seen at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. Of course, I view everything that comes out of the White House on this subject as propaganda, too. There are facts that will never be known. There are too many discrepancies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision one way or the other...
1813	As we all know, the terrorists were created by Pakistan, at least the ones who are active in India. This was done by the government that was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to bridge the gap between the two nations, the terrorists are afraid they might lose their job, so they are turning against Pakistan now. I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
1814	No. Cops need the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.
1815	The truth is there is no "one man, one vote," and there hasn't been since the beginning. It's just more obvious now, that our government is really about "one dollar, one vote." That is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves. That is the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a facade.
1816	Why did you accept it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf. A subpeona is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being the person in question, not the person's dog, girlfriend, or coworkers. By accepting the subpeona, you made it easy for the server to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact it was not. To make an analogous comparison, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit? The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
1817	Because Jr. doesn't realize (despite having been told and having pledged twice) that his job is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. He thinks his job is to do a variety of other things.
1818	Assuming such value could be reasonably calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this. It meets the intent of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides it wants towns to cooperate, that can't be a bad thing. The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if lots of people start suing the towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town. But that's a matter of writing the law intelligently and not allowing such legal loopholes.
1819	I consider myself to be pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion, but I know in my heart that it is wrong and not an option for me. However, I would much rather have these women who have their minds set on doing it go to a clean, sterile facility and not some rusty shack where they put their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, etc. I think everyone knows it is not morally right. They aren't motivated to have an abortion bc it is moral. I think they choose to because of situational factors. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option, but they felt that was their only way out.
1820	I am not sure what you are asking me, but it is your lawyer's job to explain the consequences of accepting any settlement offer. Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him. I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering. Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him. So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the attorney to pay his fee.
1821	It would be unfair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.
1822	Sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent. First of all this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and yourself. Put all this together and the crime begins with CONSPIRACY! This violates most state notary laws, attorney responsiblity rules, not to mention fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes. If you want to correct this situation I would certainly be the first one to speak to the authorities about this. Deeds must be recorded by the state so finding out about this is easy. The "real" inheritor won't have to look too hard to find out what has happened. If I were you I would take cover.
1823	Your question is both incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as fact. Let me start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you damn well better have a factual basis for doing so. You have nothing. I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed signed "for her own personal gain." I take it you regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then kid, just what the hell are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
1824	Of course they would if they got in a position where they did not want a child. When many pro-lifers do get in that situation, they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like other females, because this or that happened, so this is why I'm having an abortion". It's usually okay for them, but they are against abortion when it's someone else.
1825	What they are talking about doing is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our government to fine that illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. Also, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. They all need to follow the current laws. You are right. If you or I were to disobey the laws like these people are (employers as well as illegal aliens), we would be locked up for years. It's just not right.
1826	That would depend upon whether the person was sent to a professional in the field under which the person was being evaluated. In some cases the judge can send a person for re-evaluation if he or she determines the person who gave the evaluation was biased toward the person being evaluated. But, no, a person cannot be re-evaluated simply to satisfy the wants of a judge, or anyone else.
1827	Since this is a family member, you have to work things out. Confront them privately and tell them to stop. Threaten to tell the whole family if they do not repay what they took-not just from you but from everyone in your family. Do not fall for sob stories. The time for sob stories was before she took the money. What did she need the money for? Gambling, drugs, etc? Then demand that she get counseling. If it was for a valid reason, then you need to be firm but fair. This is not how people behave; especially towards family. Avoid getting the police involved if possible. This will only lead to being on Dr. Phil. Change the locks and explain she is no longer welcome in your house.
1828	Marijuana smoking should be legalized everywhere. It is a simple natural herb that provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realize that they were restricting the use of hemp.
1829	I do not think separation of church and state said anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches the bible, that is one thing, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who for years have flaunted their political views, and allows candidates to speak from their pulpit, should lose their tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he is a millionaire many times over.
1830	The federal government has no delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions. By and large, such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. During the last 30 or so years, the existence of such laws and the application of such laws have significantly loosened. For example, most people no longer formally dress to go to church or to dine out. For those who do dress differently, they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style. This is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.
1831	I'm not sure, but I find it hilarious that the UK wastes so much money on the royal family. Granted, I wouldn't be as amused if I were English, but since I'm not, I can laugh at that. At least we elected Bush. What do they call it over there, Divine Right? I'm glad my tax dollars don't go to ski trips, drinking binges, designer clothes, passionate love affairs, expensive cars and castles and God only knows what else.
1832	The problem is, until these people have actually been charged and convicted of some crime, she can't just remove them. She needs a supermajority vote in the House.
1833	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal. In reality, we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?--"You kill someone in the state of Texas, We'll kill you back" Ron White-- --Food for Thought
1834	It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought. Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas. Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims. It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition. Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.
1835	I simply do not think it is worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when it will end. I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and, of course, it could be a terrible and rough life, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world. In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiences, so be it.
1836	I am a heterosexual male, and I cannot find any reason for condemning it as immoral. Though I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true, and thus, biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong, there should be observable reasons in reality, so the justification for homosexual acts being wrong should deal strictly with observable reality. The prevailing justification seems to be that homosexual acts are not natural. However, this employs the assumption that what is natural is good. This doesn't seem true to me. Vaccines are not natural, and they are not condemned. Computers are unnatural, and yet they are not condemned. The act does not hurt anyone. Provide an argument showing that homosexuality is an inherently immoral act rooted in logic.
1837	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall out of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a while, then stop them, it'll be much harder later. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep them by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.
1838	I believe businesses should not (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.
1839	A long time ago Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people. Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more in the long run, but help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens. This is just my opinion, or view. I'd like to hear others. Thanks.
1840	I've heard that if we just ignored WBC, they would go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed so. I'm not saying I agree with them, but one thing that's good about their existence is extremism. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world should study more extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they are right and we as a society are wrong. If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things.
1841	My dad is 28 years older than my mom, who he met when she was 17. I have a half-brother who is older than my mom. A friend of mine and I got into an argument about a 34 year old teacher from our high school being sexting. I failed to see the big deal, seeing as there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up with a belief that age did not matter when intimacy was involved. Not only was she pissed off when I expressed this belief, but all the other girls in the group text. Why am I wrong?
1842	I have read the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972, and subsequent books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others who were talking about the problems and limits to capitalism and consumer society. Recently, I learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, held a series of conferences in Houston, Tex. focused on the "Limits to Growth" study. I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.
1843	I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container, but I think that this should be the default container. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt. Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easy to scoop with a spoon. But a large majority of the time, it is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm.
1844	I believe that the current driving age, 16, is too low and that teenagers at that age are a danger on the road. They are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting-related accidents proves that they are unable to consistently operate a car safely. I think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars.
1845	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV. I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. I feel saying "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own.
1846	I'm not sure why, but I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the worst job on earth, you should be content. For example, if I made $100,000 a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I made between $60,000 and $75,000 a year and enjoyed the eight hour workday. I feel this way because, in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life. I feel I am at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!
1847	Recently I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to disparage mp3's. But I'm willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he'd fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at say 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks. That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's (Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab etc.) or LP's. But my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
1848	I believe politicians do not have the knowledge and know-how to run a country. We have seen multiple cases of corruption, bankrupcy all over the world, and countries failing to maintain a positive economy. Most of the solutions come from an assembly where politicians reunite and discuss those solutions, but most of the time they fail to implement a good one. In the early 1900s there was a movement called Technocracy movement which wanted to replace politicians with engineers and scientists specialized in each area they run (e.g. education would be run by someone connected to it that has spent a majority of her life studying education). I believe our politic system isn't been run like it should. CMV
1849	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely then the shooting potentially would not have happened. I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1850	I hope I haven't come across as pessimistic in this post, but I would really like to hear more about what might happen and CMV.
1851	Why did the "true" gods of today's religions not see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being jealous, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wander around so long worshiping "false gods". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols.
1852	The cause of all problems is miscommunication. Car accidents caused by drivers unaware of what other drivers are doing, things turning into gossip because somebody did not take the time to say the full story, fights caused by two people who did not comumicate the rules about a game proply terrorists blowing people up because the government would not listen to their concerns in the first place. There are many more.
1853	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them content where they are. Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare means having to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare means having to pay for some overweight individual that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day.
1854	There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age. In these countries, such as France, there is a significantly lower rate of drinking-related diseases and deaths. If casual drinking is integrated into a society, it can significantly curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.
1855	I caught this forum early, which is another color forum. I'm guessing you said excite. I never really liked this color, since when I was little, it reminded me of blood and murder. But, as I got older, I started to appreciate this color more. It is also the color for fire trucks and letter boxes and...
1856	This argument is very close to me at the moment, an ex-friend of mine who is 17 years old has had unprotected sex with a minor who is not even fully developed yet. He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is: a. Breaking the law. b. Aware he is breaking the law. c. Proud of it. Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16. After all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STD's, and even permanent damage to their bodies. I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreparable mental and physical damage and is simply morally wrong. I'm not one that supports no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is is a different story.
1857	Adam had the choice of doing either good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has the freedom to do what he wants to. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof. But God has a remedy for the evil. Jesus Christ. Repent and trust in Him.
1858	I admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I do not see how this elevates us in any way.
1859	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the government's big brother program. London's Westimister Council are further compounding the problem that people don't trust the government and their surveillance of British people by taking away something that most people love and want to keep. Additionally, Banksy has made what was once a boring, ugly wall interesting, engaging and poignant. He is a celebrated artist in his own right and Westiminster Council should recognize this piece as a gift to be embraced rather than erased.
1860	In Status Quo, children are experiencing the wrong meaning of Christmas. A recent survey shows that most children see Christmas as a gift day, or a day where they get whatever they want from their parents. This should not be the case. Christmas is supposed to be about Jesus' birth. When Santa Clause is added to the picture, children, and even adults, see Santa Clause as the Christmas symbol, and not Jesus. This is like a birthday party where everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy or girl, so it is clearly not right. That is the same thing that is happening in Status Quo.
1861	I agree that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is an absurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models for many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they have breasts? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids because their favorite athlete is on them. Not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in professional players, but in non-proffesional players as well. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, all athletes would start using them regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with other athletes.
1862	Germany was an economic superpower in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new military tactics, and new scientific advancements. It was a world power before the war. Nazi Germany wins.
1863	This is a very touchy subject, much more so than most non-Canadians might think... The French nationalists are not objecting to his performance on the basis of artistic merit, which they would have a very good point, but on the basis of his nationality, when all he is really trying to do is just celebrate the history of an important place... Frankly, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's "birthday" would be to build a humongous statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham!
1864	This is a difficult choice as these are both of my favorite bands. I believe Queen is the better band because their anthems (We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions etc..) will live on longer and their music covers a wider range of themes and ideas. Pearl Jam is good, but Queen is better.
1865	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck "health care." This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1866	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were enjoyable to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people regard as the best game ever made.
1867	I will begin. Obviously, I cannot know if I would actually go through with it should I find myself in this position, but I'm at least willing to entertain the possibility. If I were suffering from early onset Alzheimer's or similar mental decline, I would consider ending my life. The ability to maintain a continuous consciousness is what makes me who I am. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, forget what I believe, then I cease being me.
1868	The average salary of an American is $32,000. The average salary of a teacher is $53,000. In Wisconsin, the salary, including benefits, is $75,000. 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits. I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire. Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school. I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman,' because it sheds light on the many imperfection of our failing public school system. The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, we have some of the lowest scores.
1869	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? Just because one man has a feeling that all matter warps space-time does not make it true. Think about it...get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks! This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the "ultimate sagging mattress" that is often alluded to. Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1870	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 military ships in service as we speak. We have a total of four military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover thousands of nautical miles. Can a mere four ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. Why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the four ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? No.
1871	There is no disagreement, but I disagree. There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israel's interests are America's interests; they are one and the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen, but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy, so war and conflict seem inevitable.
1872	My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi we had ever had, and he would also add, "and I've had a lot of sushi." Seriously, don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese rolls. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. It's worth the price of a rental car.
1873	I own a business on Craig Street and I sometimes have to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The staff was rude and did not make eye contact with me. The food I received was not fit to feed my dog. Skip this place. Forget what I said, do not skip, run for your life.
1874	I had a really great dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off so it was vegan. It was really good. The fresh basil was the highlight, pasta was perfect, and that alone makes it 5 stars. However... The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa. She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu (which I was not aware of), and always making sure our drinks were filled. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious. This was an A+ experience. Very happy.
1875	Slow service, overpriced, and the chairs have wheels on them. I had a selection of Sashimi which tasted okay but was not worth the price tag. Also had a beef noodle dish which was mediocre and had a small amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there, nothing extravagant, 2 wines, 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
1876	I don't go to Jack in the Box often, but I've never had a bad experience with one. The service here sucks. I've come here twice and this last instance was the last time I bother. I walked in both times and it took about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took 3 minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. Five guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk-in burger place.
1877	The atmosphere here was very nice and a good date spot. The menu was in Italian, but the waiter was happy to help. I got the seafood linguine, which he recommended as a popular dish. The food took quite a while to arrive, but we did get free bread with olive oil. It was quite hard and dry, so I did not really like it and didn't eat it. When we got the food, we were quite disappointed by the portion as it was expensive for the small portion we got. We easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavorful, but definitely not worth the price, so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach. Overall, I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions.
1878	This buffet was by far the worst buffet I've ever been to. The food was bland, the selection was small, the salads were wilted, there was no sign of vegetables anywhere, the gravy was congealed and the "roast beef" was the size of my fist and then they cut off 2 paper thin slices for you. Also, it was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night. You would be better off going to Mandarin.
1879	I think school uniforms are very comfortable. There is a gap between the rich and the poor, and school uniforms are efficient in many ways. If they wear plain clothes every day, they become concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Also, they feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. I do not have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1880	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms, students are given the occasional day to wear casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "casual" uniform.
1881	When they are young and trying to find themselves, there is no need to give up their independence.
1882	I think that school uniforms are a bad idea because it's too much work to clean them, and it's difficult to put on many things in the morning.
1883	I love Firefox, and this particular website is good, but I'm not clear on what it is about. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
1884	I can reconfigure Firefox very easily to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need great SEO extensions, I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I get more involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs. The breadth and variety of Firefox add-ons is a critical advantage.
1885	Firefox has user-made extensions that cater to its user base, therefore it is preferred by many.
1886	No, I would not turn my spouse in. I would simply say, "You told me I had a part in it, and we are just going our separate ways." But, honestly, I would not want to know about it in the first place.
1887	No, I would not speak of it, because you never know what the reason might have been for him to kill that person, or it might have been self-defense. For all we know, and if people question me about anything, I will not say anything. He has my trust, and I would not let him down for no reason, plus his secret is safe with me.
1888	If my husband had committed a murder, I think I would not report him. My feelings would be stronger than the fear of having a bad husband. I am not sure of my exact answer, but I am sure that I could not look at him everyday and act like nothing had happened. I believe that feelings are stronger than anything, and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
1889	If it was the person you love very much and would like to spend your entire life with, then it is definitely no. People make mistakes, but murder is a very serious crime, and I would still not report the murder of someone I loved. If that meant that I was complicit in the murder by not speaking out, then so be it.
1890	Books are always better than TV because books give you more knowledge than TV does.
1891	Well, books are better than TV because TV makes your eyes bad and kills your imagination! Read "Television" by Roald Dahl and you will know everything!
1892	I think with this growing condition India cannot replace other developed countries like USA, London, and other countries. Because most of the people are illitrate here, so I think India cannot.
1893	I think in any case, it's better to have no father than a bad father. Either way, you still lose. When you have a father, you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a bad father, then what's the point of having a father at all? If he's just going to be lousy and he won't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life than to have a lousy father figure.
1894	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. I wouldn't know how it feels to have a bad father, but I have friends whose fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish their dad wasn't around. Now, if my dad was like that, I would think the same thing. At least, by not having a father, you wouldn't know how it feels to be disappointed by one.
1895	Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools, and lands for government buildings.
1896	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population, and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart.
1897	To understand God is like your cat or dog trying to understand your income tax return! Evolution and creation are inseparable!
1898	Was there a historical record of man evolving? I must have missed it.
1899	Our world could be a giant hologram. It is exceedingly likely that we live in a simulated universe.
1900	I used to be a Firefox user, but I have found that Firefox uses far too much memory for its advantages, and I like to use more than one program at a time.
1901	Yes. Physical education can be very rewarding for both students and teachers, provided it is taught and encouraged properly.
1902	How are we supposed to combat childhood obesity if we do not begin at a young age?
1903	I think it is a good idea to make physical education mandatory in school, because it will help students become healthy people, and they will not be at risk of obesity.
1904	Farquhar won the affection and respect of the people through his actions. When he was dismissed, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that he is very important to the people.
1905	William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so he had more time to get to know the people, gain their trust, and find out what problems they were facing and how to solve those problems.
1906	Then you are saying that if the woman were to get an abortion right after then it would be fine?
1907	Now, in my beloved language, I'll tell you that what they call a "bebé, a humano" isn't anything more than a plant, menos, I would have to say that the only thing it does is churn up resources, the same way a plant does, although plants give us oxygen. No one knows if it's life, but you can feel, or think, that's what they usually say that causes people to be more like animals than animals. Aborto es matar a parásito.
1908	This isn't about what you choose, it's about "who decides?" A woman is not your property, nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to force her into servitude.
1909	It is a rather simple choice for me. I am pro-choice because I have the option of choosing pro-life. If I choose pro-life, I have no choice.
1910	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe.
1911	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.
1912	Pornography is not wrong as long as it is not sick, such as child, animal, or rape. The other forms of pornography are fine as long as they are viewed discreetly.
1913	Usually, my decision in the end is yes or no, or it goes both ways. Today, however, it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you in the moment, but in the long run, who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good, you help yourself and other people. If you think about it, we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten us into some not-so-happy predicaments.
1914	Personally, I believe that advancement of the common good is better. I do not really know how to back this up, I just know it is the way I feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something I have to sacrifice personally for the advancement of the common good, 9 times out of 10, I will do it.
1915	Who would ever want to get rid of those Catholic school girl outfits?
1916	School uniform is a great idea, simply because it makes it impossible to hold the race for fashion among pupils. Let it be, one pupil is richer than another. The rich can begin to show off in front of those who are poorer. This action will create a negative atmosphere in the school and can start a row between both pupils. As a rule, it often occurs between the girls, although it is not rare between the boys. That's why school uniform liquidates all conflicts.
1917	I think school uniforms are a good idea. There is a gap between the rich and the poor, school uniforms are efficient in many ways. If they wear plain clothes every day, they become concerned about the brand and quantity of clothes. This makes teenagers sensible, so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniforms are expensive, they are cheaper than plain clothes. Also, they feel a sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniforms are convenient. I do not have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1918	Yes, I believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school's uniform signifies its goal. For example, I wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days. White is an indication of peace, and blue is fidelity in relationships. Additionally, identical uniforms remove the wall of status. It also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class, they are all treated equally under one roof.
1919	A bad father could teach you more than good ones. Maybe he could teach you what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all, I think. He could toughen you up. Also, you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or not. You already know.
1920	The production of bottled water generates up to 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year. Plastic requires up to 47 million gallons of oil per year to produce. Additionally, over 80 percent of plastic bottles are simply thrown away.
1921	I like television. It's cool and it's great. TV is like the baby in my womb, it is like the sun in the morning, it is like the cool, breezy air on your first day of school, it is like the day you get diagnosed with cancer, it is like the day you find out you are homosexual, it is like the day you realize you have wasted your time reading this.
1922	Plastic is good for light weight and for dinosaurs.
1923	Based on the bible, it's definitely wrong, and realistically, marriage is intended for a man and a woman. It's one way of saying to reproduce.
1924	For the record, I am not gay. I am married and have a daughter.
1925	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. However, this idea has been corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1926	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Is that clear? If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would not benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage cannot be ethical. You cannot refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people." That's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
1927	India is bound by water on three sides, something which most other nations do not have. This is a big advantage for India.
1928	India is moving a step ahead in becoming a world power everyday. The concerns shown by other countries say it all. Yes, we have some internal problems which other countries do not have, but time is water and it brings changes. We are growing as one of the leading powers. I'll not compare my country with others, as Napoleon said, "Comparing yourself with others is the same as insulting yourself." We have the third largest army in the world. We produce the most number of doctors and engineers every year. But we still do not like to compare ourselves because we do not believe anyone is stronger or weaker than us. Namaste.
1929	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1930	No one has ever said science is perfect. That is the difference between religion and science. Science admits it does not have all the answers, while religion is dogmatic enough to not even recognize facts or even what truth really is.
1931	The most important reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we would not be the wiser. What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies or hallucinations. For example, there is not a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
1932	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice. Therefore, I would spank my kids, out of love, on the butt.
1933	Yes, because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and I know this from experience.
1934	Yes, I believe you should spank a child only when they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to make the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1935	One of the key components to Christianity is FAITH. Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith is the same way.
1936	I'm on this side because I love Jesus.
1937	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home. Grow up and ask yourself why you worship a cultist.
1938	Why are we fighting? Right now, those scientologists are running amok. We need to unite to fight them.
1939	I do not think that spanking should be necessary, spanking would last for just a minute, but punishment could last for two, three, or maybe more weeks.
1940	No, because if we hit our children, they will think that we do not love them.
1941	No, I do not think they should be spanked because, in my opinion, it does not work. Maybe it will once, but as they grow up, it is not a good technique to use. There are other techniques they can learn from.
1942	Not everything begins with violence; parents should only hit their kids for discipline if it's necessary.
1943	I disagree with parents using spanking as an option to discipline their children, because children are not going to be scared of what their parents are going to do to them. Also, if you do that to your children, they are learning what their parents show them. Also, that isn't going to help the children very much.
1944	I would answer in the affirmative if my spouse killed a person in self defense or in defense of another person. However, if they killed a person for killing someone or something similar, then no. If they killed someone cold heartedly, such as rape, for money, objects, or just a pure disliking of a person, then yes. Someone that's that cold could kill me.
1945	I would turn in my spouse. There is no way of knowing that if they killed once, they will not kill again. There is no way of knowing that you are not their next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught, they might just blow up their brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse, but it is something you have to do for your own safety.
1946	Murder is not right, and a person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I would not be able to look at my spouse the way I did before, and I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So, yes, I would turn them in.
1947	We are not the ones who brought life to the baby, why should we be the ones to put it to death? We do not have the authority to do such a thing.
1948	Reagan once said something like, "Notice that everyone who is pro-choice has been born."
1949	As long as it's not a disease, we should all be fine with it. It's not our business!
1950	Doesn't it say in the Declaration of Independence that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
1951	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would simply mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
1952	It is better to help yourself before you can help others. For instance, if you don't have your life together, how are you going to help someone else with theirs? If you are still living with your mother and you don't have a job, and you want to help out by giving to an organization, you won't be able to.
1953	Human nature is to pursue personal interests. If you assume that human nature is to pursue advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who pursues personal interests. Most Americans aren't very good at advancing the common good, which is why they get screwed by politicians who pursue personal interests. If everyone pursued personal interests, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to pursue personal interests than it is to get most people to pursue advancing the common good, which is why communism failed.
1954	Yes, it is illegal. The consequences are going to be you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people toilet paper. A few years ago when I was a minor, my brother and I went around drawing on people's garage doors in chalk. Long story short, we got caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. Have fun. :)
1955	It is also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now, some would say no, outlaws and police. I argue that at that point, those two groups become indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe that every cop in your town is honest and trustworthy?
1956	That is a good question. In our real world, it is much more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person. So effectively, when ex-felons are denied the franchise, poor communities are denied equal representation. Read some law articles on the difference between de facto and de jure; I'm sure you'll find the subject interesting and enlightening.
1957	No, you still have to pay your rent,but here is a few things you can do: If the landlord does not make the repair,the tenant can do any of the following: Take the rent when it is due to the local clerk of courts. A tenant must be current in their rent with the clerk of courts (called rent deposit). Apply to the court to order the landlord to make the repairs. The court can also lower the rent until the repairs are made or give the tenant some of the rent money so the tenant can have the repairs made. End the lease. Cancel the rental agreement and move. This can be done only after the tenant has given appropriate notice, and the landlord has failed to correct the condition.
1958	Although adultery may be against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is misplaced anger. This woman was not coming to your home. She was invited to your home by your husband. She was not making out with him. Your husband was making out with her. And she did not get pregnant. Your husband got her pregnant. Make sure to divorce him.
1959	It depends on what the contract says, I suppose. It may call for mutual satisfaction or give you a right to ask for them to be redone. Most likely you have to pay anyway. However, the issue may not be best approached by means of your "legal recourse." If you haven't done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone. It may be that the designer will work with you to redo the work -- it would be in the designer's long-run best interest to see that his/her customers are happy with the design.
1960	Your question is not valid because the word was used by certain people precisely as a term of offense to describe "some other people." Yes, we know that black people use the word within their own community, just as gay people use the word 'queer.' But that does not change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
1961	Most other cities that are more spread out will clean the streets less frequently. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, they pick up garbage once a week and sweep once a week. We are more spread out than Manhattan. If NYC did not clean as often as it does, there would be a lot of garbage all over the street.
1962	Okay, I take it that you are a minor. First thing, he should have never put you in a criminal situation to begin with. Obviously, he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done. If he is a man at all, he should be the one apologizing to you.
1963	I don't think that is possible, not in a civilized society. I guess you're asking this in relation to the impending verdict on Saddam Hussein. If he is sentenced to death, there will be just further violence, hatred, and bloodshed. For serious crimes,I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment...I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
1964	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the brain development is not complete at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused by alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether this is true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit. Personally, I believe that if you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to have a drink.
1965	Yes, and they need to be pared down now. The Child Protective Services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more harm than good by ripping them from their families with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone, including babies. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play their God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitiation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
1966	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it wasn't rape, then there wouldn't be anything to go to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape, where the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this, I do not know of any specific court cases.
1967	Many of these answers talk about the woman being able to choose what is going to happen to her body. What about the baby's choice? No baby would decide...I think I want to be partially born, (at a time when I could live outside my mother's body), stabbed in the skull and have my brain sucked out. How selfish are the women who think it is all about them and what they need or want? People that support this should be forced to watch one being performed, LIVE!
1968	It is possible, but it depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge. Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service. If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges wouldn't go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. But I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated b/c there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take pictures of witnesses with it in a drug case (i.e. witness intimidation).
1969	The whole thing sounds suspicious to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal, and if it has been built without planning permission, then it is also not legal. The letter that you write should not be to help them sell a property that has parts that could fall down in a gale and perhaps cause injury. It should be to state that the building should be inspected as there are no proper foundations. If you knowingly write an incorrect statement and the truth comes out, then you could be caught for aiding and abetting an illegal sale. The whole thing is a mine field, so either stay out of it altogether or put the local authority in the picture. The estate agent should also be made aware of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
1970	I think you are most annoyed with the inconsistency of laws. We have laws that are supposed to protect us from harming ourselves, yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives." I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers from picking up the cost of a person's health care if they choose self-harming behavior. For example: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use. If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1971	You cannot export democracy by force as it takes the will of the people to form such a government. Muslim countries do not have the Enlightenment background we had in the United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic. Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran. Despite the attempts by some right-wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience. Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed. Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
1972	My wife was severely abused as a child. We are happy in our marriage and she is an excellent wife and partner. So the answer is yes, but it requires patience and understanding. As far as your plight is concerned, I will wish you the best in finding true love. It is possible, and it is possible over 50. But if there is no trust in that one you are crazy about then move on. Lies have no place in a relationship.
1973	You should get legal counsel to explain your rights to you. I cannot advise you on why you and your daughter's father are not together, but if he refuses to undergo a drug screening, then most likely you will not be granted custody. The judge may order a drug test, and if he fails to comply with the court order, he will not obtain custody. Although I am not personally in the legal field, I have had to deal with custody battles many times in my line of work, and it is never a happy trail. I wish you luck.
1974	Please note that there are quite a few illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails for rape, murder, drug smuggling and theft. Because they crossed the border illegally, it means that criminals also crossed the border. Without a system, anybody can come in, no matter how diseased or criminal. And, amazingly enough, not all law-breaking illegal immigrants are honest and hard-working people.
1975	It's a bit pointless and egotistical to do so. The point of this site is to gather information from different viewpoints, and then allow others to judge the value of the content. Voting for your own answer defeats the purpose, so it's certainly unethical. It's probably against Yahoo!'s rules, too. I can't imagine how anyone can feel they've 'won' by voting on their own answers - it seems SO childish. There are no prizes and no bragging rights here - we're all just trying to share our experience and information.
1976	The Supreme Court has already ruled on this and as long as the First Amendment is not altered, abortion should be legal.
1977	in response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless people's health and lives. It would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. I don't think that is a loss of money. It would only save lives and money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to collapse. I would love to see that day. All those sleaseballs selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers and medics and firefighters. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1978	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly, Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, not just in the education system. However, when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor, mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not separate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1979	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1980	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office, fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and fill out an application for handgun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much trouble to get a handgun? I know other states are even more difficult to deal with...New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns. Why isn't there a national standard on the gun law? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
1981	I believe the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the criminal justice system. In order for the law to work, it must be swift, severe, and guaranteed: People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in two places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately, our justice system is unique in the world, it is a system that would literally let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail. I can't argue with that, but hopefully in the future people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it.
1982	Before you retain an attorney, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and request the name of their insurance provider. Often they make reasonable offers, such as doc bill plus $1,000. Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your state's minimum small claims award by $1,000 should you even consider discussing the matter with an attorney. Unless you were injured and treated professionally (have a bill), your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering with this type of occurance will be aprox. $1000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney, it is likely there will not be enough money left to pay the bill for your care.
1983	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Even those that are here illegally. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late, I would blame that on the media or the politicians making an issue of it more than anything else. I've lived in Texas all my life. The illegal alien thing is nothing new. There were plenty illegals here for more than thirty years and never heard one complaint until the last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways. Unfortunately, I've noticed that the media seems to have a large affect on the popular opinion here. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major issue is beyond anything I can understand.
1984	Legally, yes it can and has happened. The urban legend of biker chicks having sex with a guy in a park is an example. The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A guy weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.
1985	I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidentally got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is. On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.
1986	There is NOTHING on the planet more binding than that of the Triple Dog Dare.
1987	If you feel that it is necessary, yes...but are you still going to be able to work and bring in your own income? These semi-truck drivers carry insurance, and some of them carry million dollar insurance, but not all of them go after the company he is driving for. Don't go after him. He probably feels guilty about it every day of his life. I am very sorry for your pain. Good Luck to you.
1988	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts. The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example. While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured. The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. So, if you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture. Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.
1989	I am moving to Singapore in the near future and discovered that they have a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy, especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.
1990	The way I see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not. To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since it is our brains that make us sentient. So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity, then it is not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted. This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially making the abort issue way easier to solve.
1991	I believe that if a person is able to commit suicide, they can continue living. It's stupid to do such a thing when you are willful enough to consider or even act on it. It really doesn't make any sense why you would rather take your own life then live when you are so capable of the former. Suicide is not an option I find necessary and that a person who commits are stupid. So, topic is "if you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". Change my view over this topic as I am open to all responses from you all.
1992	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either, and I know my high school only had three AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning, and have a better chance of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum. I don't mean that students should be put in different grades. I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.
1993	I feel that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years. Because of this, there are no objective morals and true 'good' and 'evil' don't exist. I don't advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society. Murder, theft, rape, etc. all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general. So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feelings, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.
1994	If something is important enough to cover on a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section. I think people only turn to FAQ pages if they cannot find what they want within the main site. When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. Websites should never include an FAQ section and I can't find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO.
1995	I am very interested in a debate. I am aware that **censorship** is very related to my question and is an **entirely different debate**. I want to know why my opinion that using the word is wrong and not about how **implementing a censorship would work.**
1996	I go to the movies often and it seems pretty common that when the movie ends people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Please change my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.
1997	Not only this but anything "intrinsic" to that person is more to do with an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics. "Give me a child until they're 7 and I will give you the man" The world is one big chaotic system. Basically, every single choice you make, even subconscious ones, come together to create your destiny. The choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child. The seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through the butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
1998	Point 1: Testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly. Point 2: Education changes over time and requires constant changes in curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Point 3: Teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process. Point 4: Standardized testing prior to each school year would allow teachers to be moved where they are most effective, or removed all together if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process. Point 5: High performing teachers could be paid more if the underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
1999	I do not think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life. If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy, or once per 100 stars. It would look the same.
2000	* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation. * Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens. * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings.
2001	Since my building lacks an elevator (my apartment is on the 3rd floor), I keep my bike secured outside. About 3 weeks ago, my bike was stolen. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. I'm very pissed now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously stolen. No way I'm financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting to steal bikes on my own. Why should I not do that? Please throw in a better alternative.
2002	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself because of leaders who've been a bit trigger happy (Cuban Missile Crisis), I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now. The Cold War, for example. If the US and the Soviet Union didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khruschev, etc have for not invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them. Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
2003	I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Islamic religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the West does the exact same thing with breasts. In most places, women must cover up their breasts in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs? I invite you all to CMV.
2004	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins, I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s. This is illogical. First off, when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin other than talking about the professional football team? Has anyone ever used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term, but I am going to assume it is. However, using the term Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.
2005	People who know nothing of it seem to usually be slightly disdainful towards it, it's seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature and generally bad connotations. Some wouldn't even consider it a sport. But I consider it a form of street art, on the basis that it is * fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style * a sort of artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in. It takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative. If you're more in favor of a corporation's right to take up public space with art than you are in favor of people's desire to rebel against that with street art, then fair enough. I don't expect to change your mind with this, and you won't change mine by saying it's against the law, but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
2006	I think the pusillanimous behavior of professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course, I'm not saying that legit injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of fakers and it pisses me off.
2007	I don't think anyone ever 'asks to be raped'. But I think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances. So, if you dressed more conservatively you reduce that chances. Women are always saying that they should not be treated like sexual objects yet they constantly dress in a way that makes men (or maybe just me) see them as objects. I'm not saying dressing nicer clothes will stop rape, but it couldn't hurt. This is my current view. I'm not stubborn so I want people to change their minds. I just haven't been convinced. My comeback is always, 'why put yourself in that position'. 'I don't want to get mugged, so I better avoid that alley'. Thanks.
2008	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind tends to think of Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Thanks
2009	Gravity is only a theory, therefore it should not be taught in schools because it is not absolute. A theory, as science details, is not a law, and we should not be teaching our kids speculative notions about the world as fact. Remove teaching the theory of gravity from schools or at least include in science class other notions to explain the phenomena we speculatively call gravity.
2010	Quick summary; Religion, being based on zero evidence and abstract ideas attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings. From birth to adulthood, a person is capable of understanding the values Earth and Physics have to offer unless intercepted by religion. If easily convinced, this person is at high risk of losing the mental capabilities of being'smart' under this sense.
2011	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant in the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their children's public education and ER visits. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say it all --illegal. We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship. "those who are born here = automatic citizens."
2012	Not even close. Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried accent goes in and out all movie, and the death scene in Life Aquatic pales to the suicide scene in RT. It helps that needle in the hay is playing. And the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes movie are the tennis scene.
2013	Married life= everything in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner who loves and adores you so much that they make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and best of all HAPPINESS (otherwise, why get married in the first place?) Single life= lonely, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance! While I understand completely it varies person to person, I believe there is more respect for a married couple who truly learn life's true beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being)
2014	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired, while a chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in a circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there are only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2015	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction--it's not the nice part, but it's part of the package. And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world, we are doing more right now than any species ever has before. Would it be "enough" if it offset our impact--which is hardly "natural"-or are we supposed to save every last species, however unfit?
2016	I suppose this depends on the album you are listening to. For example, I will use the example of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.
2017	Almost every day, a democrat politician bemoans the fact that we have not captured or killed Osama bin Laden. Yes, capturing or killing this man would be a great accomplishment. However, removing bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even Islamic ones in Indonesia would likely not be impressed by the death of a single man.
2018	It depends on the game genre. For FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games, I prefer PC gaming because I am much more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller. My PC's steering wheel and gadgets make the racing games much more fun than a controller does as well. Pretty much every other genre however seems to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc.
2019	1. the death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the constitution. 2. retribution is another word for revenge. 3. the U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced. 4. once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made. 5. not enough research has been made to except the deterrence effect.
2020	The muslim integration within Britain is currently a problem. Both sides of the arguement (christians and muslims) are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration.
2021	Cats are definitely the better choice. They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to make sure they eat and use the bathroom because they can't do it on their own. Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too dumb to know the difference. "Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from Meet the Parents! With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and clean up their poop, loud barking at night, slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures. Dogs are...well...:sigh; dogs!
2022	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert causing damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran, not due to poor planning or inadequacies by the military or the administration. Normally Carter would've easily won re-election and Ray Gun would not have been elected. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.
2023	This is a blanket assertion; just because a leader is called a dictator does not mean they should be disposed of or permanently eliminated. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why assassinate him/her? There have been "beneficial" dictators just as there have been evil non-dictators.
2024	I think 1984 could be the "best" in the sense that it is the most prophetic, which was, to some degree, Orwell's intention. I feel that 1984, like all the best products in the world, fulfills its function beautifully. However, I have to admit to not having read the other three books on the list, so I can only offer this opinion.
2025	To all those doubters, you are right: no building in the history of mankind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground. It must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded on itself because of the? I forgot what I was saying. What did the Bush administration say again? Cause I'm sure that's it---they would never lie to the American public, right?
2026	I'm not saying it should be English, but there should be one official language we use to communicate with each other. We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas properly. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is the same language. I'm not saying we should destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have one official one.
2027	We have something against non-Christians here? People are voting against me opening my store to appeal to any clients (Christian or otherwise) that decide there is something they need on Christmas Day. Besides, anyone here ever forget something small while entertaining? Need some batteries for the new electronic gadgets? Want to pick up pizza for the guests? Catering for Christmas Day? Of course stores should be open.
2028	I had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We arrived at the restaurant around 1:45 pm on a Saturday. The place was full, so we had to wait about 25 minutes to get a table for five. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast, lunch, and a small brunch section. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share, and I had the frittata with tuna for my main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustics are good. I will definitely go back.
2029	This place is a neighborhood bar that is located in a not-so-great strip mall. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar, so it's usually really noisy. The food is really good, especially the wings and the buffalo chicken wraps. The onion rings are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Service is okay at best.
2030	I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. I loved their brisket and sauce, gas station setting, and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phoenix for 4 years, then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time, and yes, they have Rudy's, but they are not nearly as accessible as they are in Austin. I think I've been once in 2 years. I went for a weekend trip to Phoenix at the end of July and low and behold, what do we drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately, her sauce was too peppery for her liking, but I loved every second. Unfortunately, I was moving back to CT so I'm sure Rudy's is in my past, but I'm glad I got one last taste. I will miss you.
2031	I visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. If you are not interested in watching Fox News, or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you. The owner appears to be a proud black conservative and has no problem letting you know it. I would suggest no black person support this restaurant.
2032	We visited this delightful restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to converse. The service was attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2033	My only complaint about Kafein is the loud rave music they often have playing during the daytime. The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the staff is friendly and competent. I understand that it's a bar at night, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?
2034	Although the food is generally excellent and delicious, I cannot give it a 5. My biggest issue is that it's so hot in there! Like I was sweating buckets and I'm usually the one that's always cold. Also, the service is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food super fast and sometimes we get it super slow. Sometimes the app comes after our noodles have arrived. I don't necessarily mind that it comes after, but it's weird that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles. Overall, everything is fresh, but I really hope they fix the temperature soon!
2035	School uniforms do not keep a person warm or cold, like special clothes would.
2036	The children lose their individuality, and it doesn't feel good.
2037	Firefox is more respectful of W3C internet standards, while soft sucks by trying to force us to use their own standards to keep their monopoly.
2038	You are asked before anything is installed for the browser. In Internet Explorer, random toolbars appear out of nowhere.
2039	No way, marriage is supposed to be a bond/partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police a "snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone, I wouldn't hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder is a heavy offense, but remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person you're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)
2040	There is really no debate for those who have actually read the book.
2041	Wow, I'm impressed by your views. Where did you get these unique datas? I kindly request you to submit more points like these, please. Don't mind my words, but all these special datas are accurate. Reply me soon!
2042	I have to say, but only one word: corruption.
2043	Why should India lead the world? Kill all the politicians first, and India will develop tomorrow.
2044	India, where there is a class of opressed people and huge wealth differences? India also has a language that the majority of the world cannot understand and does not want to understand. India's education quality is nothing compared to Western education, and the world's economy is controlled by the superpowers. I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it does not even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.
2045	In my opinion, it is better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. I say this because you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you do not have a father, you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.
2046	The Singapore Treaty was signed between Raffles, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong with Commandant under the accompanying seven ships witnessing the event.
2047	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder because he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade, and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2048	It was Raffles that led the expedition to find a new trading port. Farquhar only went along with him. So even if Farquhar did not come, Raffles would have still founded Singapore.
2049	It was undoubtedly Raffles' ambition and vision which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without him, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island.
2050	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy He increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade, and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
2051	God is abstract. He doesn't often appear. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty difficult to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to grasp.
2052	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history. With the writing of the Old Testament, I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity. Therefore the Biblical account is an argument which has been in existence much longer than your note.
2053	It does not make your argument any stronger just because you think your opponent is deceitful in some way.
2054	IE is terrible, stole the tabbed browsing idea from all other browsers, and you can't get extensions for it.
2055	I like the cute little pop-up windows, but you don't get those with Firefox.
2056	Yes, of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's a greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation, to name but a few. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
2057	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
2058	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help him solve the problems faced by the people.
2059	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Additionally, to demonstrate my point, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY, this shows that he was a bad developer of the country.
2060	William Farquhar had helped more citizens of Singapore than Raffles did. Raffles was just more of the idea man. William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles.
2061	Pro-life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-choice, of course.
2062	I'm not sure I have a position, but I want someone who isn't for abortion to answer this question. I honestly don't know. If a 14 year old is raped, and then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? Is it then pro-life to have an abortion?
2063	Would your arguments be any weaker if my opponent was actually brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth?
2064	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Who says that God did it himself? Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur?
2065	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like them? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? No. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you do, it is your right to watch it.
2066	I would like to point out that my parents are very concerned about making me, my brother, and my extended family happy. They spend all of their money and time on others rather than themselves.
2067	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we do not live in a perfect world, nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our lives would run a lot smoother. You can combine the two if advancing the common good doesn't sound appealing to you. There are plenty of jobs that do just that.
2068	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can affect as a group. For example, someone who says that by not voting, they are not making a difference. However, when you consider the entire population, or percentage, it is greater than those who did vote. Therefore, if you want a good to prevail, you need more than yourself to win, by looking for others with the same views.
2069	I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because school uniform improve student attendance and students do not spend a lot of time choosing and buying clothes for school, especially girls. That is why they can use more time to study.
2070	I believe they are good, because this way all the girls out there wouldn't tease each other about fashion. Also, it makes all students look and feel equal, which increases their attention to school work since they don't have to worry about whether they are wearing the most expensive clothes in school, or whether they look the coolest, or the prettiest.
2071	Fathers can sometimes be bad, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up to the most, no matter how tall you've grown.
2072	These arguments are not factual and make your team seem like a bunch of fools.
2073	Profits. Do you want money, or do you want to live longer without water? I'm sure you can have fun with that.
2074	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be out of date with the most recent information about a certain topic while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.
2075	Television uses electricity and books such as Harry Potter are made of trees, therefore it causes more harm to the environment.
2076	Americans spend billions of dollars on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottles are also coming onto the market. These can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.
2077	The U.S. alone grew by over 13%. According to research and consulting done by the Beverage Marketing Corporation, the global bottled water industry has exploded to over $35 billion. Americans alone paid $7.7 billion for bottled water in 2002.
2078	At Poland Spring, we know that freshness and consistency go hand in hand. Our rigorous quality control standards help us make sure that you will enjoy the same crisp, delicious water every time you take a sip.
2079	From a religious standpoint, gay marriage is not even possible, let alone right. However, not everyone is religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man, so the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.
2080	I vote "wrong" because it goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of marriage. Also, you cannot exclude religion from this argument because that is what happens when people do not have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is a guideline for what is right and wrong. Without it, we are lost.
2081	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? Which country legalized homosexual unions which led to a lower marriage rate?
2082	I respect other opinions, but in my opinion, gay marriage is unnatural and against my moral law.
2083	I am a Christian. The Bible clearly states that homosexuality is wrong. Call me pathetic, weak, or whatever you want to call me, but I know for sure that the Bible is the truth.
2084	India is a wonderful country to live in. It has diverse cultures, but it still unites as one.
2085	I just know that I am Indian and I do not want to show my country down. The person who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems is wrong, because they also know how their country is.
2086	India does have the potential to lead the world, but so does China! America continues to outsource good manufacturing jobs to these countries, which boosts the economy of India and China!
2087	Atheism is a really nice guy. He makes my logic work and isn't afraid of anything.
2088	It is ignorant and foolish to think that God does not exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2089	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last resort.
2090	Yes, even though there are many different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work, so they need a little spanking to learn they were wrong. Don't always spank them for no reason, that's bad.
2091	I think that children should get spanked once in awhile. I was spanked when I was younger and I could definitely say that I learned lessons. Don't spank your kids with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them!
2092	Because depending on the punishment you give a child, it doesn't always work. Some kids need more than punishment. Because just sitting them in punishment is a possibility they will do it again.
2093	Definitely Christianity, and I am fortunate to go to a Christian school where I get to learn more about our wonderful God.
2094	I found more peace in my belief and will continue to seek the Lord until the day I die.
2095	No, because they do not really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
2096	No, because spanking might affect the relationship between the child and the parents, and children can pick up on the parents' attitude of being violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using other techniques.
2097	The child is young and doesn't know what's right and wrong.
2098	I don't think anybody would like to get spanked by their parents. Therefore, spanking should not be an option.
2099	Physical abuse towards children can cause them to fear their parents, and may cause a stutter.
2100	My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman who might be schizophrenic.
2101	If a woman gets raped and is left with a child, she should put it up for adoption. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus. People have the stupid excuse that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. If you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
2102	You are mixing topics, which creates a fallacy in your argument. The debate is not about whether murder is morally acceptable, but rather the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy.
2103	No way! There are many people in my school who are fat, and two periods of PE a week and after school sports have not changed them in the slightest.
2104	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would choose to live that way? They are constantly being harassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.
2105	The "who cares" button was your browser's back button. No one said you had to read this, vote on this, or post a comment. It amazes me that people take the time to post a comment saying they don't care and everyone should stop talking about it. Also, people who post comments like mine make me sick.
2106	Let me start by saying I think marriage is ridiculous and should not exist. That is another debate entirely. To me, who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Heck, I think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well. It would certainly be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so than any wedding I have ever attended.
2107	In my opinion, if you improve yourself, you can improve the world. First, you have to focus on yourself. Then, you can take on the problems of the world and attempt to fix them, or you will end up having a breakdown.
2108	I would be lying to myself if I said that advancing the common good was better then a personal pursuit. There are too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do won't really make a difference. A personal pursuit is better for you then trying to advance the common good in a world where you see very little good.
2109	I feel that a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money, but it can also be about happiness, love, and success.
2110	We should keep our jobs at home; pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; vote for people who deserve to be president; stop trying to be the world's peacemakers and money controllers - both providing and then forgiving debt only to "loan" more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with; they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic and use them.
2111	The Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is feared and respected by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge, "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?" The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddam's case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay &break, and the switches/wires will rust or melt away. And don't suggest a rope, because there is no such strong rope exists in the world to snap such a strong throat.
2112	Yes, freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, personal responsibility and accountability should be considered when taking risks. The cartoonist knew that the cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?
2113	If an employer fires you, they have to pay you any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) on the spot. As a manager, you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss has to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss can't prove you took the money.
2114	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented, and taken up which makes it bad or good.
2115	If he is unhappy about your dogs, then that is where your problem is. Either you find a good home for the dogs, train your dogs, or move out to a house to keep neighbourly peace. But it is really up to you. Most likely he is gathering evidence that your dog is indeed behaving badly or out of control. If your dogs are really doing something that is damaging or noisey then it would be a good idea to train the dogs. I've lived in an apartment and co-operation and sensitivity and tolerlance is sometimes not easy. But such is the life of living in an apartment. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. How many options do you have? You can't evict the guy. More complaints to the authorities is not going to get you anywhere.
2116	I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2117	You cannot sue your company for a condition that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits, or just outright laziness. removing your pituitary gland will not cause you to get diabetes. You probably had diabetes but never knew it until they did the operation to remove your gland. Sorry, but the company is only responsible for an injury you sustained while on the job. If you leave your job, your next job should provide you health coverage.
2118	I missed the last change by a few months, so I know how unpopular this sounds. Kids seem to be older, wearing makeup, hair gel, stylish clothing, and designer accessories in elementary school. I wished I could look like an adult when I was small. They own a wardrobe of electronic gadgets, too. They are desensitized to content like death and sex at an earlier age. What does this mean? Kids grow up faster on the outside. Perhaps if you take away all of these external modern devices, emotionally, they grow at a natural pace. Perhaps with so many distractions, overstimulated kids need more time to catch up to the quiet time they missed.
2119	I cannot find any ethical argument that isn't unethical. You mean good unethical ones to rationalize his actions. Didn't Hitler think the same way? For the good of the many means violating the US Constitution. And it isn't fiction, is it? You just need some ammunition. Well, you won't get it here! And there was nothing ethical about nuking Japan. Truman was led to believe they were military targets, when in fact most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke two cities!
2120	I'm sorry, but white males are slowly becoming the minority. I don't think there will be laws protecting white males. I don't think there should be any laws like that. If you can do the job and do it well, I don't think it should matter if you are black, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. Just do the job and get paid.
2121	You have to pay for services like hair cuts, legal services, tax services, and doctor visits. There are expenses associated with providing a service, including salaries.
2122	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want, as long as it doesn't cause harm to others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against your government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better than pretty much any other, and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.
2123	There is no law that says managers must hold back pizzas so you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery, the better.
2124	They do not, they have a free and open society, and although they are traditionally Christian, they are allowed to build mosques anywhere and the way they want, and are even free to live in segregated communities. They do not even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country. The outcry comes when Muslims begin demanding that their new Christian neighbors not offend them with their traditional European ways of free speech, freedom in sexuality, and drinking good beer. Some Islamic leaders even begin demands of a separatist state for their small communities within the borders of traditional European countries. It is absolutely ridiculous that generosity and guest treatment are abused by some Muslims so horribly.
2125	First of all, incest is not always "child abuse." Sex between closely related CONSENTING adults probably happens. In the USA, incest is not common. There is a stereotype about the south, that it happens there a lot. This is untrue. In fact, the highest rates of incest in the USA are found among hispanics. Furthermore, incest is rampant in Central and South America. Love Jack
2126	Brian Doyle not only got what he deserved, but he should have gotten it for the last time he did it. Without law enforcement being able to improvise, criminals would run amok in this country.
2127	No I haven't, but it sounds like it's a friend of yours and it sounds like she could get help through a pro-bono place or a low income based legal services. You would be surprised at what some places consider low income. My sister's husband earns $400.00 a week in winter and $60.00 a week in summer, and they have three people in their household. They get about $46,000 a year and they get help from W.I.C., Daycare Assist., food excetra. So tell her, or help her find those services.
2128	It is the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors. Thank God we haven't reached a point in this country where EVERYTHING that you SHOULD do you MUST under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
2129	I agree. What good is it to punish the lazy and let the booze heads walk free? Throw the potheads in prison??? What kind of logic is this?
2130	I am not sure if this is relevant to your class, but this is my personal opinion...Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not included. For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized..
2131	I think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly that misogynistic world you describe: in the U.S., women are paid only 75 for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work. 70% of the 1.3 billion people in the world living in poverty are women. Two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. 75% of the world's 900 million illiterate adults are women. Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property. Tell me exactly how we are on such an even keel? How can anyone NOT be a feminist?
2132	If you get caught, then the theater manager has the discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest-- it is stealing. If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cheated the theater out of ticket sales. You also may be affecting the box office totals for the film you saw but didn't pay to see. People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
2133	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people, but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has committed crimes deemed irreconcilable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy, but justified and necessary. As for war, it depends on the reason. For an outsider of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
2134	If he prescribed the medication, he is legally responsible, but it is possible that he does not actually have access to the records. Whatever the case, your access to your medical records is guaranteed by federal law. Whoever owned the facility would be responsible for maintaining those records. In general, I agree with these other guys. He knows he is in trouble and he's trying to wiggle out.
2135	I think the birth mother should have the right to "no contact." There could, however, be an intermediary who could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency. Women need this safeguard so they won't feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It's very sad that abortions are frequently chosen for these reasons.
2136	I disagree because, well, I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one. I will walk away from anyone who tries to take from me what I have worked for! My brother and I were the only white kids in the projects. Talk about unfair! Take your cry for reparations to someone else. I simply do not agree!
2137	The scarlet letter license plates will not pass because there are those that hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for exactly that. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlet letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUI's and not the senators, congressmen, etc., you bet it would pass. As for Imani who answered before me, she'd better be glad she doesn't live where I do, because that is exactly what one of the judges in our county has people do. I personally would think it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to pay society back one way or another.
2138	Many wish he would be. The reality is, if he does, then there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would be unbearable!! The economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even bought down lower that it already is. The fact is, Bush is using the "Born Again church" to his advantage. Is he a Christian? Very much questionable, no signs of it. Hah! He is as much Christian as Bin Laden is Muslim.
2139	No one should be treated less than any other person based on the "accident of birth", such as their sex or race. As the saying goes, "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel." In otherwords, what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not the color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job, you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian, or Native American ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community, and nation is.
2140	I think it sounds like we are becoming a communistic country trying to pass a law like that. Who does this country think it is to say what a person can or cannot spend on food? It's helping our economy. There is more to obesity than buying too much food. Some obese people don't eat much, but what they are eating is junk and empty calories. Some try to buy healthy and get things like Slim Fast, which is full of preservatives and poisons. Some just don't exercise. Maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise! Or health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk. Maybe we should make organic and natural foods more affordable.
2141	You need to prove that the other parent is a flea, or is committing felonies at this very moment. You had a child with this person, and you are going to have to share parenting time with this person, unless you can prove that this person is an unfit parent, or is in the process of committing crimes of some kind. Truthfully, this person deserves to have parenting time and influence in the course that this child's life is going.
2142	A private attorney for murder cases will cost between $30,000 and $50,000. If you do not have that kind of money, you may not have a choice. In general, public defenders are good lawyers. Their main problem is that they are overworked. This gives them less time to devote to even the most important cases.
2143	You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents, you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or private investigator may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.
2144	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may also be doing, but since he's sending letters, it's libel. If you're serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, so they will be able to tell you that. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
2145	If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
2146	I have given up hope of a progressive movement in this country. I have defended Obama to all my conservative friends for 6 years while he has: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc., etc. Hillary Clinton will probably win the Democratic primary, and will probably be the next President, and if anything she will be even less progressive than the disappointment that is Obama. Please, change my view before I become a 25 year old husk of a man.
2147	I love bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general. However due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
2148	Through my experience as an undergraduate engineering student in my final year, I have found that the university environment is actually uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to realize that we are all just trained to become another statistic for the department we are in, and worst of all, it feels like no one actually notices. For example, I came to do a final year project that was self-proposed, and I really enjoyed it, but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands, showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to conclude that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for science or whatever subject they do, but instead it is just a production line for the corporate world.
2149	We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the Holocene. The piece believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are oil seeking imperialists. So I don't think the US should be fighting other people's fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds.
2150	This may vary by country, but in my country (UK), I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots, which would last several meals as a side, the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a large enough freezer, you can even buy chicken breast in bulk that will last months... Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat, but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain that healthy food is expensive).
2151	I believe that sports in general are a tremendous drain on time, energy, and money, diverting attention away from the things in our society that truly need our attention. I think far too much effort, manpower, and resources, both mental and physical, are poured into meaningless feats of strength, which could be used to truly change our society for the better. The entertainment and camaraderie are a benefit of sports, but I believe that those could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up massive resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind.
2152	Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists), actually form their position due to emotional reasons.
2153	I hope that didn't sound too crazy or confusing. Anyway, I was talking with my parents who are both very religious, and I realized that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem that religion has is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues such as climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, etc.
2154	I believe that socialism is better than capitalism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non-hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism, in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
2155	I went deep sea fishing last weekend with a friend, and we caught, fought, and then released about ten to fifteen fish. In order to catch those fish, we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in the water. I can't find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, fought for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over. I did not like it. Except... I did. Fishers... change my view?
2156	In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't care about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title was minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favor of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further). I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.
2157	I believe natural rights, i.e. *"...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."* do not exist. I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth. To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure. Please, CMV!
2158	I've always thought of someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. I know it's a very trivial issue, but it just annoys me that someone doesn't take into consideration how the video will look when it's being watched later on YouTube or Facebook or whatever. Many times people end up covering 2/3's of the screen with black bars, or even stretching &amp; blurring the sides. These videos **always** look terrible. The only reason I've ever been able to come up with is if the person recording only intends to ever watch it on the same device. But eben then, why would you want a video that's only intended to be watched on a phone?
2159	After researching and talking to friends and family, I realized how important this topic is. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated. Some people do not get vaccinated and live long, healthy lives, and some people do and the same thing happens. I would assume this is because of our biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick, and people who aren't vaccinated get sick. My conclusion is, why should people be forced to vaccinate kids if they don't want to? They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision, and should be satisfied with that.
2160	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a 'center of consciousness' in the brain which actually causes our consciousness. This begs the question: external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness?
2161	In light of the recent screw job that recently befell Croatia vs. the host nation of Brazil, in the first round of the World Cup, I am reminded of why I cannot stand Soccer (Football). Please do not misunderstand me as an American trying to push the belief that American team sports are superior, because at its core I believe Soccer (Football) is one of the most beautifully dramatic sports. Yes, there are documented cases of corruption in other "major" team sports, however, Soccer's (Football) corruption is on an entirely different level. Oscar-worthy flops, blown calls, reluctance to implement technology, documented match fixing, officials on the take, FIFA's pilfering of host nations, rampant racism, blah, blah, blah, are all evidence indicating that Soccer (Football) at best is the WWE of world sports and at worse the most corrupt of organized team sports.
2162	Let us say that he continues with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at all to them. He conquered a lot more land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires like Russia, France and Britain almost to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn, which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide, Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.
2163	I'd like to hear from people who have been surprised by a military family member coming home.
2164	I often read people talking about the idea of natural rights which are universal and inalienable. I contend such rights are simply constructs, and have no basis beyond any other construct humanity has created. While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the "in-group" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. The extension of rights to cover everyone is a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups. There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
2165	I realize that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The US donates more money to charity/aid organizations than any other country. The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realize that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, etc). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.
2166	Neither of these 2 Italian crooners were, despite their success, really gifted singers IMO. Between the 2, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre. Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was an aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martion. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither are jazz singers, The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
2167	First of all, I am amazed that they haven't permanently put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of this guy's mouth. Second, this package is a terrible idea. Yay for the Barry-O and his lovely, lovely administration.
2168	We did not impeach GW, so why did we impeach Clinton? All he did was polish his knob. GW sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that cost thousands of lives, and trashed our name throughout the world. What Clinton did should have remained between him and Hill.
2169	We are all just people at the end of the day and if someone is attracted to someone who is the same sex, that is their problem. I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone, so the bigger problem is that they should be happy. You can argue that God made a man and woman, but I do not think that God would want you to be unhappy.
2170	PCs are cheaper and have more powerful hardware. Mac's use generic hardware, not specific Apple hardware, as is often believed. People also believe that Mac's break down or need to be replaced less often than PCs. However, if you ever work in an environment (as I have) where Macs are networked together and used as the primary computer, you will see that Macs are just as susceptible to problems as PCs. In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the 3 or so years they were used.
2171	In the Lion King, a good character dies, which gives the movie a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin. Besides my personal preference for drama, this also makes the movie more layered and thus suitable for more kinds of people. This means there's a bigger target audience, which makes the potential revenue bigger. Also, the Lion King got more Oscar Nominations than Aladdin, so there!
2172	A religious debate accomplishes nothing. Instead, insults are passed, and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical "evidence" that may or may not exist or be as firm as it is made sound. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick each other apart as able.
2173	California is the best! It is a land of opportunity, and if it was a country, it would have the tenth largest economy in the world. It is free from some of the kinds of hate/racism that you see in other states. It has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. It is the birthplace of technology and the new frontier for the modern world. It has good weather.
2174	It's ZED people!!! When you are talking to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter ZED, it's clear as day when you say ZED. If you're talking to a Yankee and are forced to say ZEE, you get a lot of this "did you say V? Or was that a D?" Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
2175	Of course it is. I would compare the situation with the lead up to the Iraq war. There are those in government who are making accusations and then trying to build intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence. Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy. Well if Israel decides to preemptively attack Iran unjustly you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
2176	It's the same old thing, whatever the current popular music is or what MTV or Z100 plays. Right now it's incredibly stupid rap music with constant references to money, cars, etc. They are so stupid they have those terrible songs that come wrapped together with some stupid dance like that little moron Solja Boy. Yeah, that about sums it up.
2177	No. The suicide of young people is not only a drain on the country (education and the like), but also means the loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society.
2178	We see different colors all the time. Most of them are shades of other colors.
2179	(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres. (2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
2180	I don't see the point in making a change from an economic standpoint.
2181	Agents, this is call center. It should be a cliché. Even though management is creating the "strategy", if it is not favorable to the Agents, then management is useless. They need to come up with another plan... unless the "power" kicks in, then Agents will be unable to do anything but to follow.
2182	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man this proof, you're hiding the truth from him. You hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth, and quite frankly, if he or she was to die thereafter and was condemned for eternity, isn't your blood on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn't. If you can't offer proof of your beliefs, that's okay, just don't promote it as truth, promote it as belief.
2183	Evolution is backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution simply states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have most likely evolved from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when absolutely everything discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory, it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof. Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
2184	We had a wonderful experience here! My date had prime Rib and I had a burger with three different types of meat in it. My date loved the prime Rib and her mashed potatoes. My burger was cooked to a perfect medium. In fact, the burger was incredible. I did get to speak with the manager and he said that it was a new item and they are working on the item. We will definitely be back!
2185	The atmosphere is cool, almost as if you are in a wooden cabin. It fits in excellently with the Canadian theme. I've had a few dishes here, the lobster roll, PEI mussels, & boneless back rib burger, all of which I would recommend. The daily noodles, however, are scarce. I've missed them all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back.
2186	I went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there, however, none came to take our drink order for 15 minutes. We left. The manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing, but he continued walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why, which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant.
2187	The food was amazing and our server Samantha was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have gone back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it.
2188	I have tried two curries and pad Thai and I have to say that this place is the best and most authentic Thai food I have had in Arizona.
2189	I had a really bad experience here. The place was not busy, but the staff was just so slow. The food was not very good, and the mushroom stroganoff was inedible. We had a group of 12 people in the patio, and it was really not fun.
2190	I was extremely disappointed in the food portions for the price point. Maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave 1 star because I had high expectations and it failed.
