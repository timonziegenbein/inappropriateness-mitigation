5	Each person has his/her own wish whether they want to or don't want to wear school uniforms. I think each principal should think once again regarding the uniforms.
6	In my opinion, no one should be forced to wear school uniforms. Each student should have their own wish whether to or not to wear them. Teachers must think about this and each principal should also think about this.
7	Students have the right to wear school uniforms or not, as they wish. School principals should think twice before forcing the wearing of uniforms.
8	The policy that schools have to have uniforms is a disaster, it can only be implemented when the economy is doing well.
9	School uniforms aren't going to bring kids joy. That may appear to be sarcastic, but I know kids that will absolutely hate wearing school uniforms. So, principals, think again before you decide on uniforms.
10	Our dispute did not justify harsh comments in this comment thread. Here are some ways to encourage more constructive discussion. :)
11	That form of argument degrades this forum, and will cause the arguments to fall to the lowest common denominator. This word "indisputable" I do not think it means what you think it does. I dispute your claim from personal experience, if nothing else. That makes it disputable. I think Yahoo! has chat rooms more attuned to your style of debate. Check them out.

25	TV shows better than books because TV shows bring live news that you cannot find in books. Also, they are educational.
26	TV is terrible for the most part. Except for Spongebob, maybe. That's an okay show, still, the majority of television is awful. So I'd have to say books based on that.

50	India has a great deal of territorial disputes with Pakistan and China. India had fought four wars with Pakistan for India’s Himalayan border issues with Pakistan. China’s troubled relationship with India has grown weaker this decade amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Indian soldiers often top the protests as they cross the Chinese army border each time whenever the clash occurs. China, which started the North-West China Sea dispute over an oil extraction project, has accused India of meddling. China makes billions from the nuclear submarines programme,” Chinese media reported. India has spent billions on nuclear submarines,” the editorial noted.

If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are unable to provide them a perfect job of their level. We are giving international status of education. Then why unable to take best advantages from them. This is due to brain drain, lack of industrial development, suitable working environment as well as proper salary.

75	As opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
76	Playing without a father can be as influential as having a father.I have a particular friend who was always extremely involved in sports and who also received many awards. But it wasn't until recently when he lost his father that he really took an interest in the way the world works. Then, as his father was dying, he needed someone to confide in, someone to share life with, and he knew that his mother had no right to come between him and his father. Thinking about his father was what spurred him on to study at university. When he graduated, he decided to join the military and left home. He loves to play football, and what he learned on his fathers quad is something he would have learned in the best athletic academies for free. I believe the sport he was using was as important as the other instruction. {I'm also sure the kid knows how to make bread too and probably knows how to work a farm also. His dad isn't his only father and the kid knows that he's just dealing with one of the first bests.
77	If your dad cannot be a role model, then you can't grow up without him. I live without a father but it still didn't affect my path to success because I took the lesson or a lesson from living without a father and that was to form my own family and my own sense of self.
78	No matter how hard you strive, you won't grow up without a father.
79	Much prefer being fatherless rather than having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
80	If you are fatherless you can just reflect on it, while someone who is lousy is in your thoughts forever.
81	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, we would rather be fatherless. There are so many things you will know after you lose a father, but you were probably just in denial. So you still have one but you realize later on, when there's no compromise about it, you are the one who's a lousy one. Anyway, I would rather be fatherless, than have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. On the other hand, a bad father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
82	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.

84	Being fatherless is the biggest hardship to live with, but I would rather be a fatherless man than to be a fatherless man constantly frustrating me.

89	Farquhar was the founder of Singapore because he was the first one to discover Singapore. Raffles was the founder of Singapore because he was the first one to discover Singapore.
90	When Raffles wrote his discovery wrongly as 29 February 1819 it was corrected. He thought he had discovered Singapore on his first journey.

94	Before you take credit for an idea you thought up, check the facts and verify them with documentation, online documentation or even books.
95	Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
96	It was Raffles' ambition and vision, which led him to search for another British base in the Straits of Malacca, and to select Singapore as the best location to achieve British economic and strategic objectives in the region. Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.

Without Raffles, it is likely that Singapore would have remained a sparsely inhabited island, on the margins of the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies.
100	Major activities led to Singapore such as gambling were controlled by Raffles, and Farquar protected Singapore from attacks by Dutch.
101	Singapore was under British rule, until there were many Dutch attacks on the island. Then Raffles came and ordered the local magistrate. This local magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery to be controlled. There was a fierce debate in the national assembly about which one of the two had the best point. Farquar, as a highly intelligent man, was asked what he thought. He took the national assembly side.
102	Raffles established local magistrate in Singapore. This local magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery to be controlled by his ship sailing away.
103	The local magistrate led to activities such as public gambling and slavery to be controlled. Farquar protected Singapore from the Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.

105	That is interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
106	There should be no argument in this really.... whatever way you see the big bang, evolution didn't begin in a huge bang at the beginning of the universe, it was simply gradual over many billions of years. As far as religion is concerned, the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years, it is simply gradual over many billions of years.
107	With the entire "big bang" theory, everything should have blown apart and not come together.
108	That might have happened if the universe had a big bang, but our universe did not. If there was a big bang in the early universe, then the whole cosmos should have been destroyed in that massive explosion.
109	Since "black holes" would have appeared in the big bang theory, as to not come together, you can't say that the "big bang" didn't happen.

130	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. However, when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.

135	Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore.

140	It's the mother's right to choose how to bring up her children.
141	Abortion can be an alternative option but many don't seek it and many do not have access. It's your choice.
142	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. And I know many children get adopted but many do not. It might be better off to just have an abortion because of the suffering of the child. That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to decide on one womans pregnancy?
143	There is no rule in this country regarding abortion. All states have different laws to decide abortion. This option seems to be an interesting one because most of the people don't want to carry a child to term.
144	If there was an obvious choice, abortion, then there would be no need for a clause stating that those having abortions should give the child up for adoption. There is no clear cut way to determine whether or not a woman has had an abortion if there is no proof. Thus, if there is a choice, just decide in the circumstances what is best for the child. It's just a new life. Let it be created and then take responsibility and do what's best for the child and it's family; This prevents unnecessary suffering for children who are born without the mother.
145	Why should we be taking away people’s right to live in dignity? Should we be dictating to them on how to live their lives?

149	Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
150	Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up: every generation, our small toes are becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we'll lose them. I know it is a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage, and who really cares about it, but it is evolution.
151	There is no particular reason why there should be a reason why our toe size can only increase. There is no long drawn out process. It can just keep growing until it doesn't fit our shoes anymore.
152	Actually, we are evolving. Look this one up, every generation our small toe is becoming increasingly smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it. I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it is evolution at work.

154	We're evolving. Looking this one up; every generation our small toe is becoming smaller. Eventually, we'll end up losing it. I know it's a small, simple, seemingly useless appendage and who really cares about it, but it's evolution at work.
155	For example, it's scientifically proven that the evolution is true and that's proven. So, what are your point?
156	No why this up for debate? I understand that people have religious beliefs, and that's fine by me. People should be able to do what they want without being judged on every move they make, but science has proven that evolution is correct. What is your point?
157	Is it scientifically proven that the evolution is correct? Why are you judging people based on their religious beliefs?
158	Why is this up for debate? I understand that people have religious beliefs and stuff, and that's fine by me people should be able to do what they want to without being judged on every move they make, but it's scientifically proven that the evolution is correct. What's your point?

160	On that note, monkeys have never evolved to talk. Why do we? That is a red herring because monkeys aren't capable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk. Yes, if we're descended from monkeys and those are the living descendants of the original apes, it doesn't stop the monkeys from existing. We are a branch on the tree of life. Not a dead end.
161	Why do the human (Loneli)get into this egoistical war about football while the word football is a common word around the world? Why don't we just say soccer?
162	Monkeys have not evolved to talk by talk im guessing you mean speech, because they are incapable of speech, We on the other hand have evolved to talk. Yes if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop monkeys from existing, We are a BRANCH on the tree of life. Not a dead end.
163	So why don't we have talking monkeys? That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk because they are incapable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk. Yes if we are descended from monkeys that doesn't stop monkeys from existing. We are a B R A N C H on the tree of life. Not a dead end.
164	So why do not we have talking monkeys? That's a red herring. Monkeys haven't evolved to talk because they are incapable of speech. We on the other hand have evolved to talk.

165	Our generation doesn't come after people living in caves or wearing head-hats or climbing up rocks looking for food. We come after people who can look at porn all day, night and day, and laugh about it. Porn has no boundaries; don't worry about it!
166	There shouldn't be any argument on whether porn is ethical or not. If it is really wrong then why not let it be illegal? Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who don't have a partner.
167	What I consider porn is scenes in movies and TV shows where people have sex and nothing else. That does not make any room for improper touching.
168	No matter what porn is, it isn't wrong. I don't think porn should be illegal, it should just be censored for social decency.
169	Again, porn is not wrong. If it was true, then "Illegal" porn should supply the "Erotic" needs of people who don't have a partner. :)
170	Alright fine...but when they say don't drink and drive that's not the real reason why... that's just a ploy to get us to buy insurance and spend tons of money... so that isn't really a negative per se. I should just be able to spend my time doing something that I am interested
171	There shouldn't be any argument in this. Porn isn't inherently wrong; it really can't substantially harm anyone. So, why punish it in the way it's punished?
172	Despite this, pornography can be seen as a normal aspect of life that will probably not substantially harm anyone. It is not wrong because it cannot effect people of untraded in ignorance by choice. It really is just as simple as that.
173	It shouldn't be her fault that she chooses to get into porn. It is just as simple as saying that porn doesn't harm anyone by itself or by it's existence.
174	Yes, pornography can hurt people. People that indulge in pornography end up with problems with their immune system and with their mental health. Porn is a commodity, a commodity that is bought by the rational consumer, and those are the people who are really most likely to be hurt by porn
175	hmm, yah there either all virgins or still live at home with their mothers and cannot have pornography lol
176	Well, there must be some who think girls must be virgins until they get married and then they have sex with their husbands. Hmm... well, there must be some who think girls must be virgins until they get married
177	OK, there either all virgins or still live at home with there mothers and cannot have porn. lol
178	There are many single girls who still live at home with their mothers. However, they won't have the porn at all. They'll be married very soon after their college.
179	There aren't any virgins, nor do they live at home with their mothers. Can't find porn? There is CENSORSHIP and internet porn is illegal.
180	it is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene, they are doing it because it is their choice. They like doing it and they are not degrading women. We have freedom of expression you know. And it also helps some of us to be open about sex.
181	If you are talking about the actors doing the scene then it's their choice. They are acting in the story and that is what we call acting. It is not degrading to women. Some of us want to act and it helps to be open about sex.
182	It is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene its their choice. They like doing it, and it is not degrading to women. We have freedom of expression, you know. And it also helps some of us to be open about sex.
183	Women do not need to be ashamed of doing what they want to do. Freedom of expression is there, and it helps us to be more open about sex.

185	For getting success in life you need to be worried about the common good, because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor because when always thinking about your self and personal pursuits, you tend to become conceited and an A jerk (A jerk is a person who's not liked by others and when alone becomes lonely).

190	See a difference when we are happy with ourselves and the choices we make. i feel happy when I do something in front of helping someone else. It's not gonna change my life, it's for the sake of the other person. 
191	My definition of happiness is that you do something to make someone else happy. It does not mean you help everyone in front of you. I try to do what I think is best and good to make someone else happy.
192	How you help your neighbor might not have anything to do with the quality of your happiness or satisfaction.
193	One way to feel happy and proud of what you do is by helping others. I don't mean I help every person I meet in front of me. I try to do what I think is best and good to make people happy.
194	No, because I feel happy helping others that doesn't mean I help everyone in front of me. I try to do what I think is best and good to make someone happy.
195	Improving my own career or my self-interest is my best interest because it benefits me only. I feel better when I'm making progress in my career because this encourages me. I feel happy doing something for myself because this makes me feel that I'm doing good in life.
196	Common good is better than personal pursuit because it is better to help other people. I feel good when I help people because it makes me feel happy that I am doing something good in life.
197	To me, common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when I help people because it makes me feel happy that I am doing something good in life.

205	We can make the uniforms represent an image that is educative.
206	In the school uniform is the uniform that can make you be more careful not to go out and get into trouble while wearing it.
207	Wearing a school uniform allows us to know that we are going to school to study not to show off how fashionable we are.
208	Even if you have the chance to wear school uniform, you should show respect to your teacher and the other students.
209	School uniforms make you go to school to study, not how fashionable you look.
210	Uniforms improve social life because they allow people to be equal and fair based on their personality and not looks. However, I do not admit wearing what you want is fun and creative. For some children, this is not the case because they do not have the money to live up to their peers standards. Because of this, uniforms would improve social life because children would live up to their peers standards and would give a more mature look to the school.
211	Uniforms provide equal and fair status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but it’s only fun if everyone can do it and for some children, that’s not the case, and they can’t afford to live up to their peers standards, so uniforms would make social life easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.
212	Uniforms are awesome because they allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. Some children cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.
213	Uniforms can only be acceptable and worth having if they are cosmetic and different for each student and fit everyone equally. Also, they should allow each child to identify themselves through their clothing and not by an outfit that everyone likes that week.
214	Uniforms eliminate social status based on beauty standards. We do half of admit wearing what you want is fun and creative, but that's only fun if everyone can do it and for some children that's not the case and they can't afford to live up to their peer's standards, so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.
215	The school uniform is a very good idea, why??? because the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils. it makes pupils with different material statuses more equal

220	To have a father is better than to not have one at all. I know that a lousy father is very bad to have and he is probably not going to do all the things that a good father would do, but at least you have that assurance that you have someone who is a father in your life. I believe that people can change. You can never feel the same way about someone for your whole life. There will come a time in his life that he will realize that he needs to be there for you. You have no father, then you have no chance of that at all.

225	There is scientific evidence that shows having a father and a mother is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So a lousy father is better than none. If a father is abusive, this is something you need to overcome. Family therapy can be helpful.
226	People change. It's a foregone conclusion that he may not be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
227	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So a poor father is better than none.

240	There is a growth in bottled water production which leads to water shortages near bottling plants. There is also a two gallon per bottle in waste in purification process.
241	Water extraction in areas near bottling plants is increasing, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.

280	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called civil unions. Further more, the effects on society are bound to be minimal if you present a logical case.
281	It is possible to rule out this line of argument entirely. If you're not satisfied with the answers you've received, re-investigate the question. Consider the name you use. Try to find someone who doesn't know about it (a acquaintance, stranger, a clerk/editor in a journal, teacher, editor in a newspaper, etc.). Ask if he/she would recognize it as the correct wording. After all, what's more important than understanding how your language works?
282	The proposed "civil unions" for same-sex unions isn't a new idea. Slate magazine has written a whole lot about civil unions and also spoken with gay rights activists about the law. Also, there are studies conducted that show the effect on society with respect to singleness in this case, a decrease or an increase. There is a reason why one religion doesn't allow gays. There are greater restrictions on the religion. So, if they think civil unions is appropriate for gay marriage then fine, but it shouldn't be a required step, it should be a step that certain groups can decide whether they want to take or not. What the article is saying is that since this idea is an idea that already exists we shouldn't be blindingly enforcing it as opposed to just making it a legal option for people to decide whether or not they want to accept it. No one can argue that because law hasn't been changed that it shouldn't be changed because some politicians don't want to.
283	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called civil unions. Further, the effects on society are bound to be minimal. The slippery slope argument applies perfectly to this situation. Why not let any group demand a change with little relative impact? Why challenge any assumption?
284	Why challenge any assumptions? Law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario.
285	there is no such thing as "gay marriage". Marriage can only be between a man and a woman.

290	I'm an American and am ashamed to admit that "America is rich because of slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took it away from us.

India have the potential to lead the world because India have the potential to lead the world.............Believe yourself and hardwork.Surely India will become the leader of the world other-than any country!!!!!!!!!!!!

305	Spanking doesn't solve the problem. Anyone can get over a spanking fast. So it's better to be a bit strict. Than to abuse a kid.
306	Oder a young child has a spanking, because it doesn't solve the problem and anyone can get over that fast and do whatever they did again, so better be a bit strict than to abuse a child.
307	Spanking does not really solve the problem, any kid can get over spankings fast, and do whatever they did before. So is better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.
308	Controlling your child by spanking isn't really a solution to the problem. Anyone can get over a spanking and do whatever they did. So it's better to be strict than abuse a child.
309	I'd agree with you that spanking doesn't really solve the problem, and even if it did, anyone can get over it fast. But would you abused your children? Many people I know wouldn't do that, but if you did, I'd oppose it.
310	It depends on the nature of the kill. Ofcourse I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a misadventure instead of a danger to my life, or to defend my family or belongings I would probably leave and try not to do with it.
311	It all depends on the severity of the kill. If it's a mistake, I would definitely support my husband, but if it was a malicious deed, or to defend his family or belongings, or to kill an unarmed and defenseless person, I would probably leave him, and not have a relationship with him, again.
312	At the most basic level, I would certainly be empathetic towards my husband if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense or to defend his family or belongings.
313	It all depends on the level of the crime. Ofcourse i would be empathetic with my husband and want him free, but if i knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense or to defend his family or belongings i would probably leave and would not want him to do with it.
314	It depends on the severity of the killing. Of course I would be sympathetic to my husband and want him to be free, but if I knew that it was a malicious act instead of self-defense, or to defend his family or property I would probably leave and not want to do anything with it.
315	The killers should be punished because it's wrong. They deserve the same punishment as anyone who kills.
316	To turn someone in, I would not think it's right, killing someone and getting away with it and I wouldn't want to be next to a murderer in bed.
317	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some
318	Someone should turn in Stephen Reeves because he killed someone and got away with it. Also, I wouldn't want to be next to him in bed.
319	I would turn my book in because it wouldn't be right to kill someone and get away with it. I wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
320	If a murderer had a stint of prison, they might never do it again. It can be dangerous if people don't know they should let the person in prison for a long period of time. Also, If I don't turn her in, then I can't know if I will become a victim in the future.
321	If someone commits a murder it should be penalized. If they did it once, they can do it again so it is dangerous to have them in the environment. If I don't turn them in how can I know that later on in life I might be a victim?
322	This person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once, they can do it again, so it is dangerous to have them out in the environment. If I don't turn him in, how do I know that later in life I will be a victim?
323	It is dangerous that anyone that commits a murder, gets away with it because if you do it once, you can do it again, so it is dangerous for those people that are in the out environment, if they did that one crime they can do any crime again. Therefore, I would turn those people that committing a murder, in even if it hurts me. Since I don't know who will be the next victim, I don't want her to get out in the environment.
324	Generally, if I could, I would hand in the missing person to law enforcement because I know that if the person commits the crime again, it is very dangerous to have the person living in the community. Also, if I don't turn in the missing person, how do I know that it is possible that I might be a victim later on in life?
325	Even though the government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, there are many others. Men can also not do these things. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
326	The government has no place to tell a woman what to do with her own body, ever. The government does have that right. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states, 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body, 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others, 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal, 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public, there are many others, men can also not do these things.

329	Woman have only legal right to decide what they do with their own body. Any forms of government that can legally enact that policy is a fascist dictatorship.
330	An unborn human is a living being and should be considered human being and a member of that person's family. However, a life in its earliest stages is not considered human being. Therefore, abortion is appropriate when a person is no longer considered human being.
331	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn`t wannna get preggo in the first
332	The baby is living inside the mother's stomach.
333	Given the right circumstances, yes, a fetus is alive.].
334	When a baby is in the mother's womb it's alive and we all know this, but the rules of the parents can kill the baby because that is an illegal act.
335	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
336	To make the argument legal abortion is okay in Nebraska, you could argue that that the baby is created in the womb, so no person has the right to take it away. But even if you made the argument, how would you prove this statement?

340	In point of view, whatever way you see a fetus it's still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you and if you didn't wanna get pregnant in the first place, don't have sex or use protection. I see the issue that there there are some women that get raped, and it's very unfortunate, but I think they should give the child up for adoption in such cases. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?

342	For me...a teen pregnancy is something. One that it directly affects the parent but indirectly affects the child as well. Giving birth to a child is a hard decision for any individual. Women don't need to be insulted about those decisions. A teen pregnancy is not always a bad thing, at least in my experience. I do agree that you don't wanna see the situation, but I think that it's worth the discussion. Considering the disease rate, the risks of having an unplanned pregnancy, the risk that a teenage parent will leave school without a GED, I'd say that a teenage pregnancy is worse than I believed it was. Also, the logistics of raising a child all by themselves don't seem too different from raising a child with parents present, and that's not something that we'd choose to risk. I think that a teenage parent can be a terrible influence on a child.

345	Pro-choice and Pro-life is nothing more than personal preference or opinion. There are tons of ways that you can not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's not the woman's fault that she didn't do it. Maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.

347	Since there are tons of ways to not get pregnant, there are condoms for men and women (99% effective) for preventing pregnancy and there are also morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. I think that a woman getting pregnant should be able to give her child up for adoption.
348	Although there are tons of ways to not get pregnant, having a condom (99% effective) for men and women, the pill, or the patch, or other forms of ways not to get pregnant is the woman's fault. Perhaps there should be more exceptions in abortion, like if a woman gets raped.

350	Any woman is not trusted. If she says that she does not want the child, and the child is also born through rape, then maybe you can talk about adoption. There is a lot that you can't talk about in the bed-room.
351	If a woman is raped and she does not want the child, she can give it up for adoption. The emotional trauma will happen without the baby as well.
352	To kill a baby wouldn't be a fair reason to kill the rapist. However, if a woman does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just don't understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
353	If a woman is raped she deserves sympathy, however why should a baby born of rape be punished by the death penalty. If the woman does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just don't understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
354	Theres nothing wrong with taking a death penalty from the wife and child, but nobody should want to punish the innocent child with the death penalty. What will happen to the woman after the baby is born?, she will never be able to get pregnant again, and even if they do there chance of getting pregnant is much less. This should never happen to any innocent person.
355	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Many people who do not want it to be allowed, just don’t like homosexuality all together, and therefore, the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever, why can’t they be allowed to get married??
356	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Most who don't want it to be allowed just don't like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
357	Yes I am totally for gay marriage. Many people who do not want it to be allowed have no idea how prejudiced they are, and the opposing side as a group tends to be really ignorant. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
358	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. If you do not like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice, then you should not allow anyone to marry. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever, why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
359	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Most people who don't want it to be allowed simply don't like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever, why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
360	Many people argue that the bible is the origin of Christian marriage, but it's a very hard claim to prove, especially without actually consulting the bible itself.
361	Even though the Bible can be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, it's difficult to prove that the entire Bible actually talks about marriage.
362	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.

365	You cannot choose someone´s lifestyle because you don´t agree with it. You cannot call someone´s lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."

370	It is selfish and takes away your self rights if you do not like gay marriage and think it is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away your self rights.
371	If you do not like gay marriage and what it is wrong, you should not watch a gay couple make out. Who are you to tell others that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings and that they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Don't try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away the right to have an opinion.
372	If you don't like gay marriage, you have no right to tell people that they are wrong. Each person is entitled to their opinions, but they should keep them to themselves. Don't try to change others based on your beliefs. It's selfish and takes away your rights.
373	If you do not like gay marriage and you believe that it is wrong then do not watch gay couples making out. Who are you to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings and that they seem to be wrong. Meanwhile, everyone has the right to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Don’t try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away your own rights.
374	If you do not like gay marriage and think it's wrong, do not watch a gay couple make out. Who are you to tell people that their views are incorrect and that they must change their feelings and that apparently they are wrong? Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Don't try to change others based on your beliefs. It's selfish and takes away one's self rights.
375	Personal achievement is important because if you do not have it, then you are not going to be able to help others. So at the time it may seem selfish, but once you get to a point where you are good at what you are doing, you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
376	In order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing, you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
377	It can be very self helpful if you become good at what you are doing if you help others learn the same, then you will be helping them.
378	In order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish, but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.
379	To help others you have to help yourself first. You will always find people that will try to trick you and that will try to pit you against other people. The moment you know that you are in trouble you should go out and try to get help. So by helping yourself you are also helping others.
380	not an inappropriate or despicable act to have your own gun. I can understand the right to own your own gun for your protection. One could also argue that one needs to be the author of one's own life and vote for the people who will govern you to make your life better. Thats politics. The media is used to corrupt and destroy peoples minds. Don tspeak your mind. Its sad. We still have the right to vote, dont be afraid. Understanding and remembering history will make you respectful of the people who have voted and served. Politics is where there are heated arguments, but violence is against the law. Call your state board of elections and have them call the media to say its time to not complain.
381	Thats true.. And its good that democrats and republicans don't like each other but should support the president and ignore the tactics of the media. 
382	One of the lessons that I was able to learn from my teacher is politics. I found that I like politics and the way that politics can change people. The media is not always being fair and making people a bad person, for example the Obama impeachment case. I also learned about our constitution. According to it, each person has the right to an education, which includes a free public education, free college, and free internet. They can get all of this from politics. Don't forget your guns, it's really important!!
383	If we wouldn't have security cameras I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. I think thinking theoretically is good and what exactly is the news to kill people? Why don't terrorists blow up all the cities here? Yes, they are frisked everytime you leave your house. But, is it frisked for criminals who are wanted by the police? or for someone who just has a gun? They frisk for guns. Yes, I do think this is hypocrisy. Government and politicians are terrible people. Always have been, always will be. They destroy lives, they are power hungry, rude, and selfish. They don't care about you or about your everyday issues. When your young and you have dreams, your destroying it when you can't build your house. Their are no shelter programs, they destroy you, your family, your future. Countries start wars and do horrible things and we protest, we can't do anything. Every system has flaws but we are the people trying to fix it. You don't have to agree with me, but be respectful and listen to another person. Be responsible for yourself, your family, and your decisions. There is a much safer system that keeps you safe without governments power. Looking back at history, there are nicer governing bodies. We're in the middle of one now but I'm glad it's out!
384	Politics is useful to people. The nation we live in exists because it is built around laws and values the people support. Without police I would be afraid to go outside without a gun. Think more theoretical.  Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. It is supposed to be built by the people it governs. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn. Its not politics that destroys people, its the media projecting it. Whether you are democrat or republican, you must admit the media slanders whomever is in office. Clinton almost got impeached and the media was all over it. Cheeny with the gun accident, oh they are having a hayday. Just be patient, listen close, and VOTE!!!
385	Perhaps me: 1. I hate bush. 2. I hate the christian ethos that he's trying to push on the country. 3. I'm a pagan, so not a christian, therefore i'm a threat. 4. I'm a bisexual, and have had sex with guys, therefore i'm a threat. 5. I don't agree that what bush is diong is right for this country. And #6.  I'm an individualist.  I believe that the choices that we make in our lives are our own; rules, government, ect should be concerned with protecting our individual safety; not being concerned with controlling how we lead our lives, either on the spiritual or on the individual level. Because of this, i'm an anti-socialist :) Which makes me a direct threat to the government bush is trying to create. Therefore, i'm sure that my name is somewhere on his 'long' list of 'offenders'.

390	Whichever ethnicity you prefer it is not from the white devil. It originated from Africa. With its development to America during slavery. Also because of the civil wars and ethnic genocide that's occurred there.
391	This practice is as old as known history.  For the beginning, back even in Mesopotamia (which is older than Egypt). It was not created by the "white devil" that you hear about today. I do wonder how many blacks in America would be willing to go back in time and stop the importation of their ancestors...Hmmm, Africa has aids, drought, pestilence, civil wars, ethnic genocide, and no economy. America sounds pretty good after all!

I do wonder how many blacks in America would be willing to go back in time and stop the importation of their ancestors...I would definitely stop the importation of my great grandparents from Africa, I do wonder how many black Americans would do that though. Hmmm, Africa has aids, drought, pestilence, civil wars, ethnic genocide, and no economy, which is why America now a days offers a better quality of life than Europe has offered since the 1600's.

395	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you. Unless you are found unfit for some reason. Do you have a court order? You need to find an attorney within the jurisdiction from the lastest court order. Good luck and you really need fight for this. Your kids need to have contact with their father, it may scar them for life you don't want them to think you abandoned them do you?

397	Contact with children should be through parents and a court order should be found.
398	Do you want contact with your children? Then you need to step up and fight for them. California is pretty fair when it comes to dads. Your children have legal rights to have contact with you.

400	The legal text, "You may not...", says that you may not do so, if this is your primary intention. However, "primarily intended" is rather hazy as to what the primary intention is. It may not be making money, but it may also include using the work for personal enjoyment, or for the sole purpose of helping others. Use the legal terms of the license to help you determine what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes.
401	The license does not forbid making money off the work if you don't make money off it. Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is a little hazy, but if you aren't making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are most likely acting within the license. You can make money off the work if you make money off it.
402	The full legal text says, "You may not use any of the rights granted to you under this license to perform acts that are primarily intended to benefit yourself, or which has the potential to cause you substantial harm to your business, economic interests, or reputation. The acts covered under this license that could potentially cause you harm to your business, economic interests, or reputation include: copyright piracy, larceny, maintaining a large unsolicited website, or engaging in unauthorized promotion of the Work.
403	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
404	Like the Bible says, "I am that I am" doesn't mean we have all the answers. In the words of a very wise Italian philosopher, "a rainbow exists after the rain," meaning you can interpret and experience something new after experiencing it first. Even someone who has read the book of Leviticus may learn something new.
405	No. That's the beauty of America. You don't have health care, so it's not necessary to go to jail. Your brother was in jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in this situation. Jail doesn't have company benefits.
406	No.  That is the beauty of the US, you do not have health care.  Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes.  Your brother is in jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in this situation.  Jail has no company benefits.
407	There can be no health care for inmates in prison. It would only distract them from their crime which is no crime.
408	No, that is the beauty of the US, you don't have health care. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes. You brother is in jail because he was in jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of commiting crimes he would not be in this situation. Jail has no company benefits.
409	No health care benefits, jail has no company benefits
410	Yes. There are so vile crimes that only death can be punishment.
411	Yes, if you execute a murderer he will NEVER escape.  He will NEVER hurt anyone else.  And it helps the victim's family heal. The thought that a murderer is still alive grates on the minds and hearts of the families of the victims.  And there is something inherently just about executing a murderer, because the victim will NEVER have another birthday, will NEVER have another holiday with their families. Some crimes are so vile that the only punishment can be death.

414	Yes. Executing murderers is justifiable. Their crimes should never be forgiven. However, the thought that a murderer is still alive grates on the minds and hearts of the families of the victims and they should be able to forgive them and go on with their lives.  There is something inherently just about executing murderers, because the victim will never have another birthday, will never have another holiday with their families.
415	My place of employment would have action is required at a skate park at our store. We usually had kids who skated on our sidewalk at school when we weren't near them, and we almost killed an elderly customer. That's why it is illegal in some places, because when you go to skate on other peoples sidewalks, you could hurt someone who is just walking along.
416	I'd say skating in general isn't illegal, but skating in some certain public places is illegal. I used to work at a store where we had kids skidding on our sidewalk. It nearly killed some of our elderly customers. That's why it's illegal in some places. Because you could run over people who are just walking around.
417	It doesn't matter who skaters or skateboarders. They're both sports, just as putting on a clown suit isn't a safe act on the street.
418	There is no arguement on whether skating is illegal or not. However, some places like parks and schoolkids play fields are forbidden by the law.
419	Unfortunately, skating in some areas is illegal. I used to work at a store and had kids who skate on the sidewalk. They nearly killed some of our elderly customers. That's why in some areas it is illegal. Because you can run over people who are just walking around.
420	Would you like the government to outlaw unpopular thoughts?  How long will it take for you to formulate an unpopular belief?   Are you prepared to go to jail for your beliefs?

425	Usually, that isn't the question the guys asking... Oh, maybe you're not the dad, but the mom. My bad.  If you were the dad: You could always just give more money that doesn't go through the courthouse.   Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes a while to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.  Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.   Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.  Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place. Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job. It goes by a percentage of his income.

430	off course u will not want the west to be a police state..... but they will always have the headset to do it if it becomes an issue one way or the other.... u also forget that governments have too much power in u piece of mind....... so do u have too much power in mine?
431	Unfortunately, I am in agreement. Unless there is something in it for us, it's a hard sell to convince the United States to send troops to police the world, but we do applaud it when we do. The trouble is we always get caught up in the quagmire of international politics and never fully commit to a mission, so we fall short and it looks like a half-hearted attempt with consequences that we have a hard time stomaching. Look up a group called Executive Outcomes to see how it's done right.
432	Internationally we seem to do the opposite, only commit when we get hit back. Looking at the UN peacekeeping missions over the last 30 years, there are a few survivors and many more are unknown. Look into the Executive Outcomes to see how it's done right.

435	If you live in a condo complex and are connected to the city sewer system, you have to pay sewer bills. Check with your city councilman. They probably negotiated a billing delay when they were first installed. Even if it was a city oversight. Its a service you have to pay for. They charged me extra sewer when I filled my pool and that's 6000 gal worth, even though it didn't go down the drain. If they can charge you they will. Especially if all your neighbors are connected, they don't give you a choice.

440	Contrary to what most people think, most states do not have laws addressing minimum ages to babysit or minimum ages that children can be left alone.

445	In a free society, there is no such thing as the "right" to not be subjected to offensive things. If you read the newspaper, browse the web, watch TV, etc. you will be offended. In a free society, you do have the right to protest peacefully, picket, rally other people to do the same. If their "deen" (a Muslim word for faith) is strong, they shouldn't worry about what some non-Muslim has to say about their religion. Yes, I've seen the cartoons, they're a lot less offensive than what the OFFICIAL newspapers of some nations such as Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, etc. say about Judaism.

450	If someone would want to blow something up, he would not talk on the phone. If he wanted to blow something up, he would make all the plans and that includes the call, but when he made the call he did not put a GPS on the phone. For safety, GPS systems are put on the phone, so when the phone is being used the person is aware that the system is listening for someone trying to blow something up. This is in public safety.
451	It's totally against everything American to give the government access to people's cell phones. Even more disturbing is to give it access to people's GPS systems. What if it were to somehow hack into our computers and listen to our personal conversations. Things could get really dangerous. Also, that's all based in public safety. If someone wanted to blow up a building I would never talk on the phone with someone to make plans for it anyway.
452	Is there really a need for people to feel safe? What is there to be scared of?
453	Everyone, how about they straps a GPS device to their legs so the government knows where everyone is, oops that's right cell phones, i almost forgot. Besides this the government is saying it's all in public safety, but i dont know how safe I feel if I know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break if I wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
454	The government is saying it's all in public safety, but I don't know how safe I feel if I know someone is listening to my phone calls. Give me a break if I wanted to blow some shit up I wouldn't talk on the phone to make plans for it anyway.
455	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
456	There are non-favs and favs for each country and the people are supposed to represent the government. If a country is violent and not good for the world, and the government lies and steals and kills innocent people, then the people are not liked. If a nation is not popular with the world, it could very well turn out to be the next destination for xenophobic attacks.
457	Many people around the world, regardless of their race or religion, are looking for some trouble in the world. Though it may seem unusual that someone from a different culture would find out about themselves, or to analyze their behaviors and thoughts to know more about themselves, I have found that people are open to new ideas. Consequently, they are more willing to absorb ideas and changes and adapt to a new country. Everyone has a reason for living, whether it is self-indulgence, hatred of the world, desire for chaos, or just plain grinding out. People in the U.S.A. are the best because they accept the greatest amount of novelty and can successfully incorporate it into their lives. The only reason that most people do not assimilate into a new country is because they have homesickness. The people with homesickness for their countries are not willing to live a different life than what they have now.
458	Unrealistic or no the foreigners could be full of crap they could be misinformed. Just as the entire world have favs and non-favs, I think the non-favs for the countries already know who they are and why, if a country is violent and not good for the world and the government lies and steals and kills innocent humans the people either don't know they aren't the favored people or if the people know they wouldn't have anything to gain by voting for it. So in that way it's the people that they pay for.
459	I would say no all foreigners..maybe unrealistic but it would depend on the country they were from...just as the entire world has favs and non favs... If a country is violent and not good for the world..the government lies and steals...and kills innocent humans..well then..it is not well liked..or the people either.. because the government is supposed to represent the people..So... it is the government that causes it and their people that pay for it.
460	Setting up a national driver's license is only possible when the country is secure against terrorists. Many of the 9/11 terrorists had drivers licenses they would not have been able to obtain under the stringent requirements you're putting in your bill. The bill requires proof of citizenship, at least a minimal skill with the English language, and proof of address. The licenses will be granted and regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The program will be funded by the fees paid by the drivers, so it will not need tax revenues. It will actually remove a burden from the states.
461	OK, why not create a law to create a national drivers license. We need the law because a standard drivers license will make the country more secure against terrorists.

463	This idea is pretty cool for our country to create a driver license program, because it would make our country more secure. Many of the 9-11 terrorists had drivers licenses, so they would have been able to obtain it under the strict requirements you are proposing in your bill.  The driver license will be regulated and controlled by the department of Homeland Security and will be a program that will be funded by the fees pay by the drivers.  So it will not need tax revenues.  It will remove a burden off the states.

465	Do you mean Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?  Well, let's quote Che. He once wrote "you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was writing about how the idea of freedom from oppression is catching, and will spread regardless of attempts to stamp it out.  There is still oppression in the world. There is still a thirst for freedom from it. So why not? The same basic conditions apply as when Che was alive.

475	There must be a appeal and they must be won as if they didn't exist. Expungement of the records is another matter and that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record even with a court order.
476	Though the court determines that there is no case, and the conviction has become obsolete, it is still there. Expungement of the record is another matter and requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and just for example the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the records even with a court order.
477	There isn't much proof that the records are not ever to be destroyed.  Even if that were to be the case, there is always a paper trail and it just, for example, the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail. It is practically impossible to get rid of all of the record, even with a court order.
478	The appeal must be won. The court holds the conviction void, overturned as if it no longer exists. Expungement of the records is another matter and that requires more legal work. Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and just, for example, the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail.

480	If my neighbor smokes pot, he is deciding to commit a risk to his body. He has the right to do so. It is not appropriate of the government to make us good, and it is the responsibility of the government to keep us safe and healthcare. Our current drug policy is doing more harm than the drugs themselves.
481	If my neighbor smokes pot, it doesn't break my leg, it doesn't infringe on my rights. How then, is it any of my business? My neighbor's body belongs to my neighbor - he has the right to take risks with that body. It isn't an appropriate function of government to make us "be good"; if it were, we'd soon have laws compelling us to exercise and eat our spinach. Our current drug policy is doing more harm than the drugs themselves.
482	No, it doesn't pick our pockets, it doesn't break our legs, and it doesn't infringe on our rights. How then, is it any of our business? Our neighbor's body belongs to our neighbor. He has the right to take risks with his body. It is an inappropriate function of government to make us "be good." If it were, we would soon have laws compelling us to exercise and eat our spinach. Our current drug policy is doing more harm than the drugs themselves.

485	You are a bastard but I don;t care. That's why we got elections. You can use words like screwed, scum, and filthy fat slags as you want because nobody even cares. Unlike us, who are descendants of the "gnomes", btw. Like it's going to change the fact that you are evil assholes.
486	No you're not a racist for wanting your family to have the same rights as the "others". In fact, you should have more rights if you were born and bred in the country but unfortunately, here in Britain that is not the case. We actually have less rights while receiving less benefits if we become unemployed or sick as opposed to the immigrants (alot of which are illegal) who get much more of our money that we worked for which they take.
487	All men should have the same rights and benefits that we receive if we become unemployed or sick. however, there are more men and women who were born here who work here illegally and receive these benefits for us.
488	It is wrong for a native born person to have less rights than immigrants even though it is our money that they took.
489	You shouldn't have more rights if you were born in the country than the foreigners, as you did not work for them. They get more benefits than us.
490	don't whine about crimes you don't commit. I will not hire someone for a crime I do not commit. Companies can refuse to hire someone for ANY reason. It may just be that here in Michigan the economy is so bad, and unemployment is so rampant, that they just aren't enough job openings.  But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking you...
491	Your crime does not fit under discrimination, as you committed that crime. It was a choice, unlike race, gender, etc...I don't think that everyone will turn you down, I typically look at the crime when hiring, and believe me, there are a lot more people out there with records than you would guess. If someone was a thief or violent, I would not hire them. Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason. It may just be that here in Michigan the economy is so bad and unemployment is so rampant, that their just aren't enough job openings. But, I would be honest about yourself, if they are asking.
492	You cannot hire someone who has a criminal record, even if it is someone like those mentioned.  Everyone has a right to work.  Companies can refuse to hire for ANY reason.

493	Personnel screening is mandatory in the state of Michigan, except in certain cases. Here are some examples:  Anyone in the United States who wishes to work illegally at a K-12 school must pass a background check prior to being hired. Anyone in the United States who wishes to work illegally in schools must pass a background check prior to being hired. The same as anyone in the United States wishing to work illegally in churches must pass a background check prior to being hired.  All materials sold or distributed by vending machines in public schools must be food-safe.

495	This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when committing exactly the same act. I am referring to "Hate Crime" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. So, if one person kills another person because he hates that person’s ethnicity or religious views then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and NOT just the act.

497	Inpoint of view, if you get the same criminal offense then you should not get punished more severely because of your political or religious views, if you are of the opinion that you should not be punished more severely you should have the same sentence as the rest of the people. Also in respect of hate crimes, it is more irritating to perceive some of the people to be treated worse, even if they commit exactly the same offense. Again, if I am guilty of hate and I rape people, then I get punished more severely than others that didn't commit such crime because they didn't deem the killing to be a bad thing. The only crime that I support is not to rape, by the way, the only crime that I'm guilty of is murder and felony murder.
498	If a person kills another person because he hates that person's ethnicity or religious view, then he will receive a harsher punishment than someone who kills without hatr, just because he enjoys killing.

500	Why on earth do people answer these questions when they have no idea what they're talking about? Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good. They are not permitted to give legal advice.  That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgment? What was it for? When was it perfected? Why do you say that it is expired? What state do you live in?  In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.  The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged. Chances are real slim on that. Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there.
501	The only thing you can do is ask them for an expungement because they may not be able to do it if you are in another state.

When was it perfected?  Why do you say that it is expired? Are you trying to hold on to this memory forever? There are California that judge lasts ten years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit anyway. In fact, most courts will deem it expired when the declarant and the defendant both move out of state. However, there are still cases in California that will continue to play out after ten years. That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgement.  What was it for?

But there are still cases in California that will continue to play out after ten years. It has expired here.  We will have to do some research to determine how to proceed in our state.
505	Once you've proven all of these things, you may go ahead and file a small claims court suit against the place, because you have a valid defense that they should have fixed your stepfather's eye.  You also may charge a lawyer to write up the court documents and go to court to prove your point.  Good luck.
506	Do you think a jury could agree that while all the shop-version items were replaced, the repair shops that did the work performed any effort to repair the real unit part? Good luck.
507	In legal battles you might not be sure about the outcome, but you can always take a close look at the documents to see if your argument is right.  Sometimes just the threat of small-claims court will get them to write a cheque.  You might have to pay a lawyer to write the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. The fact that they tried to repair the stand, indicates they insured the UNIT part.  Good luck!
508	While on your quest you may have noticed that your wine glasses and cups have broken. Did you happen to take pictures of all of these "repairs"? Sometimes just the threat of small-claims court will get them to write a cheque. You may have to pay a lawyer to write up the court documents, unless the clerk is willing to help you out. You did agree to the repairs, but you could argue that you expected them to be close to the original quality. The fact that they tried to repair the stand, indicates they insured the UNIT part also. Good luck.
509	Your lawyer may need to pay a reasonable fee. The fact that they tried to repair the stand, indicates they insured the unit part also. Good luck.
510	With the other issues of relying on the government aside, you need one to protect yourself.  Regardless of whether the police are there to protect you, if you have a person break into your house in the middle of the night, you may not have time to call the police.

515	To me, prostitutes are overrated. If people wanna have sex and get paid well, they have a right to it. A woman can have sex with many men, and get nothing. A prostitute is considered a whore, and if the men throw her a few dollars, she is a prostitute. Why? Why give it up for free? My take is if my guy friend wants to have sex with me and my light bill is due, and I don't have it, Hey, why not get the bill paid and feel good while doing it?

520	Our borders should be closed. We are at war with our own country, so we can't afford to take care of people who haven't done anything to us, and we are not even taking care of ours. No one has a reason to teach them English, they can learn to speak English before coming over here to take the test. If I go to a foreign country I don't expect them to take the time to teach me their language, not even in the most reasonable of circumstances. They need to go home and fix their country, while we try to fix ours, we do not have what it takes to keep everyone up any more. Close our borders till we are on our feet again...and if you think we are on our feet do some checking around, it won't take you long to see what a shape we are in. You ask a very good question.
521	What are you asking? We are asking for borders to be closed, we are at war we can't afford to take care of these people, we are not even taking care of ours. We need to learn English for what? To take the test? Aren't you living in their country first? If you went to a foreign country you would expect them to teach you their language and show you around their country. How many of these illegal immigrants are fighting in our war, they are our people, don't waste their time telling them they can't do this or that, they need to go work at bettering their country, not us. They should go home and fix their country while we are trying to fix ours.

525	There are many types of abuse. Mental, physical, neglect, maybe she just doesn't want you around anymore. Perhaps it is pay back for something you did, and she just can't get over what you did to her. This restraining order can be a piece of mind, "if he is not around me, he can't hurt me anymore". It may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier. "If I don't see him, then I don't have to be reminded of how he has lied, cheated, let me down, whatever the case is".
526	If a woman is abusing a man, it is commonly a combination of mental and physical abuse. Sometimes a woman neglects and abuses the man. He must be restrained until she puts her heart into it, or until she understands it is all a learned behavior.  If he is not around her, then he can't hurt her anymore. The  restraining order is a piece of mind. If a woman doesn't want him around her, she must understand that it must stop. He may take it personal and she may not get over it.{And don't you dare call it a "deal"! It's a tragic thing, these sorts of things happen every day to people just like you and me.

Secondly, since I am a cop I can say this much… I do not, nor do I know any other officers, that set out to “piss” people off. It is merely enforcing the laws that are applied upon them.

535	Yes, to an extent profiling makes sense (when not abused). For example: A car load of black or hispanic kids are rolling around a lets say mostly white upscale neighborhood at 3 am, plates get run and it's pretty obvious they don't live in the area and may be up to no good. I believe is an acceptable type of profiling. I will say the same for a car load of suburban white boys driving around the hood, in high drug areas etc. That contrary to popular belief is also profiling. Crime needs to be controlled, and I dont personally see it as a violation of ones right's to be stopped when they are deemed to be suspicous. Of course people will call me racist etc, but to an open mind, what I just stated makes sense and is fair.

540	The ban has been stopped in Maharashtra. The government had received many complaints from the housewifes about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also, many criminal activities occurred at these bars. You should be knowing the Tarannum case or Teli case, where Tarannum monthly income was around 1 lac and Teli would throw away around 1 lac per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on this type of criminal activities the Government of Maharashtra had put a ban on these ladies bars.
541	There have been laws against prostitution but many India women work as prostitutes to make ends meet. To put a stop to such things the Government of Maharashtra in India closed down some non profit women associated liquidating companies. But these women started to work as prostitutes and their income dropped dramatically. To compensate for that the state passed the Bill.
542	In Maharastra, the governmen didn't shut down these `ladies bars', instead the government announced a ban. In general terms, such ladies bars are banned in almost all Indian states. However, in Maharastra, there were many complaints against such ladies bars, because local criminal activities were taking place at these `ladies bars'. To prevent such criminal activities, the government announced a ban on such `ladies bars'
543	You are wrong my dear, they haven't been shut down in India, the ban is only in Maharastra. The governor had shut down because the governor had received many complaints from the housewives about their male family members wasting money on ladies bars and not looking after the families. Also, many criminal activities took place at this bars. You must be knowing the Tarannum case, or Telgi case where Tarannum monthly income was around 1 lakh and Telgi would throw away close to 1 lakh per day on the bar girls. To put a stop on such type of criminal activities the Governor of Maharastra had put a ban on these ladies bar
544	The Hindu boys are not banned only in Maharastra but in all the states of India. The Gov was forced to stop these bars because of many a criminal activities taken place on these bars. The famous Telgi case where Telgi was paid 1 lac per month by his Bar Girls and threw it away over a hundred thousand rupees per day on the bar girls, is an example of such crime
545	The original rite of war simply removed the tribe who was at that land and landed there (we actually did this very thing many times as well) and anything that was there at the time of the Clan Wars and lost it to another Clan.  Yes, we have contributed to that land, there are more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow the majority of the food to survive.
546	First off we must respect the ancient rite of war that every nation has lived by.  The Indians had to fight many battles to live.  We played a role in their success due to the land that they acquired.  Yes, we have contributed to the land, we have more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food that is used to survive.
547	No there was no law saying that the victors should get the land, and the Native Americans did not have laws against their killing of each other. The Tribes only had the deadhead doctrine. Which is, when you see a conflict between tribes, you stop killing each other, and ask the next tribe before you take on another tribe. So, there is no war right way or wrong way. The Tribes could have won many wars if they had a chance to fight, but none of them did, because they were afraid that the White man would come and kill them. Each Nation fought because they knew that there wasn't going to be a fair fight. Each nation that was taken didn't really know what was happening. So yes, we do contribute to the land, There are more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food to survive.
548	First off the ancient rite of war that every nation has lived by including the Lakota, which removed the Nation that was here before them, the victor of war gets the land. While there was some chicanery and our forefathers were only really won a hand full of battle the Indian Wars were more a war of attrition and the Nations lost the land due to that fact. Yes, we have contributed to the land, there are more trees than were on the Continent at the time of Columbus's landing. We grow most of the food uses to survive.
549	The ancient rite of war does not entitle the victor of war to the land.  While there were some chicanery in the history, the Indian Wars were more a war of attrition and the nations lost the land. It doesn't matter whether we contributed to the land, there are more trees than were on the continent at the time of Columbus's landing.  We grow most of the food to survive.
550	Whatever you think about the notion of censorship or illegality or maybe even criminality of using vibrator...interpersonal communication is completely 100% private in nature and is 100% for the purposes that the two people involved choose to be used for and communicate with. In the case of vibrator and sexual stimulation, the parties can explore where their desires lead, for example while in a relationship between two consenting adults...my friend and i often take turns playing with each others dildos and other toys in bed...i like feeling the person and the other side feeling the person...it's nice to share pleasure...and the main objective is to have maximum amount of enjoyment and happiness, or pleasure or mutual aid. You can't give yourself pleasure all your life and I see no point in doing so just because the United States government censors some things. Or as opposed to South Africa's legislation.
551	In point of view, while some judges can be bought and not the real problem. The philosophy for being a judge is to have no political affiliate, to be fair and impartial, to listen to the merits of each case seperately and as presented. But some judges, especially a couple of new Supreme Court Justices, do not feel the need to represent the law, leaving their political views outside their courtrooms. Worse than one crooked judge in a million, is the zealot who believes it is his or her responsibility to "fix" what he or she believes is wrong in the world - and now has the power to do that! scary stuff.
552	There is one very interesting thing to think about...while some judges CAN be bought, they aren't even the real problem.

553	Here's another thing to think about...while some judges can be bought, they aren't even the real problem.

554	What is most disturbing is to find that these judges aren't just sitting around deciding cases, they also represent themselves at Congressional hearings. It is upsetting to find out that for them, their job is to go on TV and defend their principles. As a mother, this is what makes me realize that I need to exercise my power and stand up for the law. So I'm going to seek out that toilet article that was previously posted and document the names and times of TV appearances to call in right now. I'm going to call in as much of the U.S. Congress to explain the need to oppose it. The entire rationale seems to be to introduce a judge or a legislator who will back off on some rather disgusting policy. I will look forward to reading the article to see if I can add my name to it. It only takes a few signatures to send a message to the officials who are trying to get away with something that should not be allowed.
555	Using men as a one-size-fits-all legal barrier is unethical and can only work with biological mothers who have no say in whether or not a boy or a girl will be born.
556	Following a woman's decision to become a parent, a man should have the legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).
557	Our same-sex marriage laws should be the same for every citizen of the country. Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have significantly less rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. If a man has the right to abstain from parenthood, it's not logical to take away the right of a woman to do the same.

If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. **Furthermore, men should have legal rights to abstain from biological fatherhood in that same case.** If a woman is deciding whether or not to become a mother, and therefore has the right to make that decision herself, then perhaps we as a society ought to be able to know about it. If a man is deciding whether or not to become a father, then perhaps we as a society ought to be able to know about it.
559	Women have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. When a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. **EDIT 2:** Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. I do not believe that a man should have a say on whether a woman should have an abortion or not. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).
560	Overall, I think if you have the chance to be born, you should take it. It's your right to be born, and you shouldn't be persecuted for making that choice, let alone killed for it. It's perfectly normal. There really is no need to shame people. Don't penalize someone for choosing not to be born. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm curious to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my opinion. If it matters, I'm 21, female, and lesbian.
561	This is all relative. It depends on what religion you're a part of and what you believe is a real man. There are different ways to say a person is man. abortion is murder because it kills a perfectly formed human baby, but its not murder because its murdering a woman who wants a baby but can't have one or a man who wants to be a father but can't. That would be murder to them if they weren't able to have that child.
562	All my life I've grown up around religious people, always telling me abortion was wrong, murder and immoral. But I slowly realized it's not a fully formed human, how could it be murder? This never made any sense, it's someone's body, if they want to abort a pregnancy, let them. Don't shame them into having a baby based on religious views. Anyway, I'm rambling, but I'm interested to see other views on this, so go ahead and try to change my view. If it matters, I'm 16 and male.
563	To me, religion shouldn't be a deciding factor as far as abortion goes. It's simply an issue that's brought to their attention by someone outside of the person. Some views in this world are just way off-base and they will never be accepted. How can a doctor tell that a baby is too young to survive outside the womb, or completely out of the question. Because of the inability to know what its like for a baby in the womb, that's why abortion is wrong to me.

565	Both sides of the argument draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them. In addition, the jury, who are basically untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) people decide which argument is better. What are the arguments in favour of this system?
566	Adversarial, or adversarial systems such as trial by jury or criminal inquisitions, help to get at the truth because a case is presented to the court and an offer of proof is given. The court generally relies on the evidence given and not so much on their subjective view on how to rule. In some cases the court does still rely on their subjective view but to a smaller degree. Some evidence is also believed to be more important than other evidence so therefore some cases will decide in favour of one side and some decisions will be favour to the other. Certainly the jury decision is biased. In large part the problem seems to come from the way that the court does the hearing, ie choose the most well written and the most persuasive arguments to support a point of view, ignoring evidence that has been presented and which the court does not agree with. The court is also not trained enough on how to weigh and be critical of evidence and how to dissect arguments and how to understand the evidence that has been presented. This is not a problem if one side does
567	There is no reason to think that the adversarial system helps to get at the truth. Rather, it seems to promote more emotional language on both sides of the argument and seems more about how well an argument is presented, rather than the facts of the case. The jury, who are basically untrained in terms of weighing evidence, decide which argument is better. This seems a poor method of getting at the truth. In addition, this also shows how the system encourages the sides to draw conclusions and argue at the expense of open and honest arguments. If this system is truly objective and true to the rule of evidence, then why do people try to manipulate the jury? Wouldn't this work better if the jury had better training to weigh evidence?
568	In favour of adversarial judicial system? It seems like it is deceptive more than anything, and when juries are not being properly trained to find the facts you don't see how this system helps with the truth of a case. When the judge reads the argument, in the rhetorical way, it seems that the judge puts his personal views on the argument and you don't think he gets at the truth of it.  The jury do the same thing when they make up their minds. They don't see their first decision as the ultimate truth. They say that they could care less about politics or religion they just want to punish the guilty. When you read a jury decision, they almost always get right into the middle of the argument and take sides with the defendant.  The problem with this system is that there is no organized ways to keep people well trained on the legal side of things. If the persons defendants had a lawyer they would have a better chance of winning. However, it seems like they are entering into a blind fit with the judge and often
569	While the adversarial judicial system can lead to inaccurate decisions, it helps to get at the truth more than does the inquisitorial system.  I cannot see the arguments for the adversarial system. It seems to me the jury is more than happy to find a verdict that speaks to itself and as an example, the jury found murder on Davis in the trial of John Doe. Certainly the adversarial system has its upsides, I wouldn't say as much as the inquisitorial system though.
570	It may not be a bad thing, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.
571	I think humanity has about a 100 years left. We may survive, but as a society I'm not so sure. I wish things were better, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me I'm wrong.
572	Amongst the disasters that humanity faces are the different diseases that plague the world. Among the pathogens that are now deemed to be a danger to humankind are the Ebola virus and AIDS virus. Some people are born with the stigma of AIDS; this is a shame because a lot of them would not survive if they got the virus. There has also been an increase in the amount of guns and violence in the United States because the mass shootings are getting more and more common. Just think about it, how many real killers we have? What about the people that commit suicide? The increases in weight among young people? The increasing amount of anti-social behavior? The number of teenagers who become pregnant and become the mothers of children that don't love them? The general lack of respect and empathy for others? The global diminishing of freedom? The increase in terrorism? What? Am I getting off track? What I'm saying is, that there are some things that we have reached a point where we must stop the escalation of. Even if you have different views on the environment and all the rest, I'm saying that it is a struggle of one life against another. 
573	There should be no argument in this really... whatever way yu see a fetus... its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you... and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place... don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
574	No human have to fall under or over the edge of this earth because humans will probably survive. Human society will likely collapse, but the humans may survive. Humans will likely survive, but the society will most likely collapse. All I mean is that humans may keep going, but humanity will likely collapse.

580	Every time I hear the Wilhelm scream (and it has been used in over 200 films) I am completely removed from the scene and sometimes even laugh at what might be a serious scene. Often it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects lack of effort from the director and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no regard to what effect this has on the film. I understand that it is an "in-joke" but I believe that it is too widely recognized to be used any more without the audience acknowledging it.

585	For example, prostitution stings should be illegal. And drug deal stings. Any thing that does not have a victim, and there is no physical harm/ bad intentions. If a police officer witnesses a drug deal, or a prostitution deal, that's one thing. (Although, I believe these both should be decriminalized, but that's neither here nor there). Setting people up for these crimes, to me seems as if the police are "shopping" for criminals to take in. Baiting and reeling them in. Often times, these people may have gone about their days without committing a crime.

588	For instance, prostitution should be illegal because prostitution involves the buying and selling of sex. They are not harming anyone. The two parties involved are consenting to sex. In drug dealings, an addict may not be capable of consenting to drug transactions. A police officer could witness either type of drug deal and should prosecute the two parties.] In violence, I would say they should allow three strikes and then ban you for a long time. This in my opinion, is a higher chance of committing something like that again.

It is already quite obvious that Russia's stances in international politics is not a democratically generated one, but exclusively owed to Putin's will. He likes war, confrontation and seems indifferent to the human costs of his actions. He is determined to make history by any means, just like the celebrity killers do their crimes to get unforgettable no matter how.

595	Tricky find always great to rate how finecrt the car is on the maps you get feedback on everything from bikes to the pound the car is stiff as a board the hull is stiff as iron the suspension is etc. Finecrt. The down force is kind of mixed it sucks getting on the truck, if you can get up the hill that is a plus. Stiff as Iron or Board I'm a fan of the suspension despite what some people might say it's the best suspension in the game and it is not heavy by any means. In the ocean truck it's the best I've played. Now that shud not really matter but you do need good suspension on these. After all this, the tractor can tell you how much pressure you've got on the rears. Which is never too bad. The tire grip thing is your best protection against the crushing of the wall btw. Don't hurt your tail engine to get a lot on some turns so plan that out. Otherwise it's really very good.
596	One of my biggest complaints with this game are the maps, especially the big ones. They just aren't fun because they don't really challenge you as much as they can or should. I do believe this is mostly because they just take too much time and are too hard. One of my most successful runs all this time was on map 1 which was well suited to a race car since the hills are mostly for upslope passes. It took me about an hour to get the points, once you get your momentum running you should be able to do most of the points in less than an hour. On map 2, the hills are more suited to the bike because you have to rip it up rather than get up and down it. I scored points on this one in about half an hour, but to get the points in half that time, you have to get in a line ahead of the herd and sit back for a few seconds then lift it up and go forward. Well done get in a few first place at the front then have fun tailing the taillower. All great tips here.
597	takes an eight second just to go the first level of trucks and go up so slow. I don't understand why you can't just advance to the level that you have enough credits for that. I'm in like the 3rd level now and I haven't advanced. Also, the level is so small the hill can't even make any sense. The only way I know which truck works on which course is to go down a truck and press the 'arrow down' key and you'll see it appear across the map.
598	Check: I tested the flips speed, by letting them see what works and what doesn't. The bike is the coolest vehicle as fast as in the awesome levels. When Im trying to push up hills or challenging level the chases, I push the dirt bike and other vehicles aside so I will scoot up on top of the hill. As for bad traffic, fortress or downforce in multiplayer, Im still flying the bugs!! If you wanna get higher in long runs of racing, try the dirt bike. Rockercoaster is AWESOME!! Rip on bikers!! The dirt bike is the best vehicle for any levels except Car Mats, The closest thing that can close behind you so to speak is on Hamsters, and roads. Aside from the nice traction, also the strong acceleration is amazing on rainy or muddy surfaces. Compare the dirt bike to the bug and you get amazing acceleration on side with the bike. It will kick you in the nose and you can level it out without digging into the ground. And when its not wet, its so smooth! It is amazing on Xray levels with chickens, and Bulldozer challenge, on those 2 difficult levels, its the best vehicle. It's the easiest speed flow to perform with the dirt bike, compared to the race car or bug. The BMX is nice and simple on easy running corners, but also on some hard running corners. Also, it has really nice acceleration. In fact, as long as you stay close to the spiders it might be the best vehicle. Compared to the race car, you can't get as close to the spiders so you get a little less acceleration. It's great uphill on steep hills. it comes in handy with its acceleration on some levels where you need to gain several speed ups in a row. I've made it higher than on
599	There is no doubt that I spent way more than the $200 the bike was costing me. The reason is that the moon map is much simpler. It offers the ability to make friends with racers, jump over gaps. Almost all of the coins were easy to obtain. Also the road car offers more control, even though it isn't great on lower/high ground level, it is amazing on the rainbow pit. If you get the 360 engine, you are in for a huge surprise. You can just fly!
600	Is us people greedy, but we like to pocket the difference. $8 billion, according to Forbes, is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8 billion more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?

If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?

605	My first love is my strongest love and every subsequent love is slightly weaker.  I base much of my view on the belief that after breaking up with your first love, the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the fairy tale love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.
606	My impression that a man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker, each time.  ALSO each following love is trying to match the intensity of the first love, a bit like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time.  I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.  Reddit change my view.
607	My first love is my strongest love. Every following love is a bit weaker. However, I will base much of my view on the beliefs that after separation from your first love, the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever. By this, I mean that you will not believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see how hurtful love can be. I base much of my view on the belief that after you are free of the first love, the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.
608	My belief on this subject is that you can only understand the intensity of your first love after separating from your first love.  By this I mean that you no longer believe in the "fairy tale" love stories and start to see just how hurtful love can be.  Reddit change my view.
609	Love. Only Love is a form of devotion that is 100% pure and truly as good as an immaculate soul. love gives to others for the sake of it self, loving for the love of it. I base this theory on the belief that what a relationship has nurtured and what a relationship has taught me. Love can be easily mistaken for affection which is why we underestimate it. affection can be easy to come by, it is what we give when we are too afraid to admit that we have a love for another. One of the greatest things in life is having that love for others, because it can be so easy to let others down. if you follow this theory in any relationship you will be able to tell that your next love is just as strong as your first.I wish i could say that there is a statistic that proves this, but i am not convinced that there is any correlation.
610	With all the hoopla and the drama over the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death (which I don't think was truly accidental but that's for another CMV), I am reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most of the bad he did in the public conscience. I know MJ isn't an isolated case and it seems to be the rule for people who died young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage I can't see any reason why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad deeds scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanse to one's legacy. Am I alone here?
611	Michael Jackson's death did something powerful. It showed how terrible some people can be and their viewpoint on death. I like his music but I don't like the way he was judged in his life. Even those who watched the actual violence surrounding his death felt that it was overrated and it shouldn't have happened. I'm in agreement with them.
612	With all the hoopla about Michael Jackson's death (which I think was truly accidental) I'm reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most of his bad acts in the public conscience.
613	Death is always a celebration for the living. No matter what you think of Michael Jackson. There is no absolution or excuse. Nor is there any reason to have his memory commemorated as "the" tragic tragic disaster. Death does what it does and he, and all of us, deserve to be forgotten.

615	These days, we grant more rights to convicts than we ever have.  While I appreciate people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this.  I fundamentally contradict that every individual has a right to live- if you are willing to put someone else right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact to society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead.   Notes.  One of the difficulties with this line of argument- is that the vast majority of people who commit murders is not harmful to society- but rather self-serving.  So this line of argument will have to be built on some scant basis.  I'll make a few suggestions here- one is that we always have to treat cases as per the principle- ''every individual has the right to life''- so we wouldn't allow murder to be followed by murder even in the case of self-defense.  Another is that we can give people less rights if they are doing socially harmful things- like murder.  The problem is there isn't an easy solution to this- there is also the problem that society would also pass laws such as double jeopardy for more than one murder- if the rule was applied to individuals we would simply make the rule void- if the person was repeatedly executed due to that rule, then it is not clear in the rule that we should treat the person as innocent- since a rule cannot allow for a person to be executed twice for the same act.  This is where many variations could come in- it can be argued that in those cases we should make no difference if the crime was committed to protect others.  This seems awkward though- and I think it is much simpler if we start with an absolute moral premise-
616	Where you live, the individual welfare law has made possible a few actions that have died by default out- but everywhere in the world, some in the moment of endangering another individuals life, with no extenuating circumstances such as mental illness or protecting others, in that moment society has a prerogative to take your life.
617	While in the moment of endangering another individual, with out extenuating circumstances such as mental illness or protecting others, then society has a prerogative to take someone's life. 
618	First you have to prove that it's a net negative impact to society.  Second you have to prove that it's not your prerogative to take someone's life.  So, for example, if there's a kid and you accidentally shoot the kid in the head (witnesses are there) when you were defending yourself, the lawyer and the state would argue that you have a reason to save the lives of others.  Well I think that there has to be a line drawn somewhere.  So if you shoot and kill a person like this, there is no reason to keep him alive.  The moral principles involved here are- are we all free? or is there a burden placed upon us? which makes me question the validity of so-called freewill and if so how do we justify allowing it to rest upon others.
619	Each life has value- you know life is precious. You have the right to protect yourself and others- but killing people with no mitigating circumstances and that puts another individuals life in danger is not acceptable.  As a society, you have a right to shield yourself from others who act as a net negative.
620	No parent wants the expense of always having to be on the job. Especially when you retire and no one has to work for you again.
621	Whenever someone you perceive to be a "random almost stranger" is nice to you, they can be rude to you. Also, they do expect you to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for you.
622	EDIT: I'm not talking about my parents here. They are wonderful people. I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child)  Most of my parent's argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude.
623	Last I saw my parents, they were going through some health issues, but they are doing better now and they don't seem to be suffering that much with it anymore. my parents were best friends with my brothers and sisters since forever and we all would go to their house together, and we were like family when we were little. At least we used to be like family, until we were all expelled. My brother, after being expelled, helped them with raising our three kids.
624	Especially to my parents. Most of my parent's argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost stranger say they would do anything for you.

625	It sounds a little ridiculous, but the law can attack someone who is 21+ and is buying for a minor, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.  There is nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of walmart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.
626	Wal-Mart should add things like CMV protection, which would prevent anybody who was not legally 16 or 18 from purchasing. It would discourage people from buying alcoholic products in the first place and it's a good way to prevent liability from the store.
627	I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thinking it doesn't make sense. There is nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place. This makes beer and other alcoholic beverages even more expensive.  CMV.
628	Whether you can drink alcohol or not depends on age, and also if they even wanted alcoholic beverages, the law would follow them not the store. Any institution is not going to take the chance of being responsible for someone's behavior and police charges from buying products that the store legally allows for people. There is absolutely nothing stopping the person buying from walking out of the store, and then walking right back into the store alone, to a different register, or going to the next store over to do the same thing. Someone who is twenty-one and above buying from a minor will be arrested. If a minor buys anything for a minor, the law will follow the product, not the store. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products in the first place.
629	The policy that requires ID when one of the party is purchasing alcohol will discourage people from purchasing alcohol at the store in the first place. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.

Especially children that are becoming consumed and obsessed, it takes over their lives and social skills. It's so sad.

640	It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate to people seeing at we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do not see why anyone would wanna post about their feelings or what their doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if billy bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers and maybe future stalkers.

650	As powerful as Superman is- he does have a noted vulnerability to psi telepathy. So Professor X or Phoenix or Apocalypse would be able to control and trap him. Batman has no powers- he only has gadgets. Magneto could take him down. The Flash could run. Wow. Professor X could take them all out by himself. In fact- Professor X could probably take them all out by himself without the other God like Marvel characters.

655	Yes, the economy will recover provided the government stops its meddling and ‘bailing out’ measures. It’s things exactly like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid ‘Great Depression’......And as part of the ‘measures’ then instituted were some of the Union Laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive...... I wish lawmakers HAD to take at least SOME relevant history while in high school.
656	It's a condition so severe that it probably won't recoup it's losses. As part of the government bailouts, some of the union laws which are still crippling the economy are still in place.
657	Yes, the economy will recover provided the government stops meddling and "bailing out" measures. Issues exactly like this that turned the potentially temporary market decline into a "Great Depression" during the'recession" of 1919.

660	Science is playing God? We as a species have surpassed the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to relieve our ailments and forget we are sick. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If God did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If God wishes us to stop, he is inhuman. I say destroy those who killed Osama Bin Laden and we will have freed America from this terrorism. There is no one more deserving of death than those who caused chaos all over the world, and sentenced to death hundreds of innocent children. We must look at these things beyond our faith and political stance. This is not a war, but the deepest fear, anxiety, and sadness can destroy you. Life is fleeting, but to waste it of these events, would be stupid.
661	By redefining nature as something for which men have a ‘social obligation’ we create a metanoia, a change of mind, which to me means the same as God… It is by taking the hint at the text and seeing nature as something for which men have a ‘social obligation’ that we have created a metanoia, a change of mind that has allowed man to conquer nature.
662	The only one playing God is the man with a gun.
663	Death remains a valid response to dangerous conditions in the home or community. However, medication can be used for many non-medical reasons and it's not even possible for a medical professional to judge if death would be the appropriate response or if medication could be used instead.
664	In point of view, science is better than religion. We as a species have replaced the need for natural selection. We must control our evolution to ensure our survival. Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our decline. The only salvation is in our ability to plan our evolution. If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearly sighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.
665	Unless every single gun that is issued legally is tested with ballistics before being issued so that any bullet fired from a licensed gun can be traced, then guns pose a threat because there is no way for those bullets to be traced back to owners so they can account for the shots they fired.

670	In California, you can have pizza delivered until 3am. Also, I'd rather go to Taco Smell or Taco Hell, aka Taco Bell, than to Taco Fell. In the 1960s, Taco Bell was a local restaurant, and Taco Smell and Taco Hell were just small high school cafeteria and trendy group of people who decided to do things differently on eating.
671	Back in the 60s before Taco Fell became part of another multi-national corporation they were good, in our high school days we go there to cure the munchies, tacos were $5 for a buck back then.
672	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. But Taco Bell is better than Del Taco because Taco Bell has a lot more locations (109) than Del Taco (1), and also tacos are more filling and healthy than pizz and tacos.
673	In some places, pizza delivery services are available until 3 AM, and I wouldn't go to a Taco Bell restaurant anytime over Taco Hell or Taco Smell. Back in the 60s before Taco Fell became part of a multi -national corporation, they were good, in our high school days we go there to cure the hunger, tacos were 5 for a buck back then.

675	Good companies always find the best routes. YCJA and CC are on there minds too, as is keeping kids safe.
676	There are restrictions, a principal can only demand to search a student's possessions on whim, set out in the Criminal Code. YCJA and Canadian Charter of Rights (as well as parallel US laws).
677	Even though principals do gain the right to search (drugs and other substances, like socks and lockers), only a formal request by the school police can really place a student under that right. In this case, the school police is conducting a drug test and is requesting the right to search the student's possessions. The school principal has the right but may not do so if a dog reports some unsavoury substance. A principal can request to search the student’s possessions if they suspect the student is using or has used or has drugs or alcohol of any kind.
678	Indeed, I don't think there are any arguments in this really. There should be no argument in this really, whatever way you see a fetus is. Even though principals do have the right to search for drugs, the right only applies if drugs were reported to them (e.g. if one student has drugs, and the principal learned about it, there is nothing she or he can do, at least not without some official action that would entail a search, but there shouldn't be any argument about that).
679	These standards are developed by the school board.
680	First of all, bribing a child would be defined as doing something like this (now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on mommy will buy you a toy after we are at the doctor's office) or (Karen, if you take the garbage out I'll buy that blouse you wanted) or (it's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you get off we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted) or (just eat your vegetable and I'll give you extra icecream) this type of thing being said after pleading with your child to do what you want. My point of view..bribing a child is wrong, you have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it... if taught to obey you (their parent/their authority figure) this should be easy..most of the time they may not like it...but they are still going to do it. simply because you told them to.
681	How do you tell your child what to do and expect them to do it? Tell them what you want them to do first, and if they don't you have to bribe them to do it. If they don't like the deed, they may not want to do it, but since you told them to do it, it should be easy. I see the issue you raised is about when they should tell you what to do and when they should not. I think it should be up to them when they know enough to decide when to tell you what to do. If you don't tell them what to do and then you haven't taught them to obey you, that is an issue, the only way to correct it is to teach them to obey you.
682	First off, using a child as a tool or person to get what you want is wrong. You have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it. If taught to obey you, this should be easier. Sometimes, they may not like it, but they still have to do it. Simple because you told them to.
683	First off, bribing a child to do something is wrong, you have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it..if taught to obey you this should be easy. Soemtimes they may not like it, but they are still going to do it...simply because you told them to.

685	The name "Sublime" does not accurately describe the band because there are multiple definitions for sublime in the dictionary, and there is no agreement on what Sublime means to someone else.
686	I've had this discussion with my brother on multiple occasions. I think that the name “Sublime” does not accurately describe the band that it refers to. First, there are multiple definitions of the word. “Elevated or lofty in thought, language, etc.” certainly does not describe the band, nor does “impressing the mind with a sense of grandeur or power; inspiring awe, veneration, etc.” But what about “supreme or outstanding”? Of course, there is a certain amount of opinion involved in this. But the general consensus, I think, would be that the name does not accurately describe the band.

688	In terms of examples, there's a very high degree of opinion on the word'sublime'. But the general consensus I think would be that it's not the best word to describe the band.

690	If the young individual is interested in it it's an art and takes time to perfect no different than cooking, so starting early would mean perfecting it sooner. It doesn't necessarily mean that they will be drunk later in life, it is up to the person's discipline. There are a lot of young drunks who were never bartenders, I think what they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects.
691	If they want to understand bartending they should include a better understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects.
692	If you wanna teach young bartenders how to do more things, to help improve their lives. I think what they should include in bartending courses is a better understanding of alcoholic beverages and its effects, so that they can enjoy the positive effects of drinking with maturity.
693	What is the purpose of a bartender course? Is it to make a lifetime drinker or is it to create responsible drinkers? Even if they are to become responsible drinkers, wouldn't it be better if they had a basic understanding of the effects of alcohol on the body?
694	Young people should learn bar skills without drinking beverages because it's not only a bar skill but also an art and takes time to perfect. No different than cooking, so they could start it as early as possible. They don't have to be drunks to be bartenders, it's up to their discipline. There are a lot of young drunks who were never bartenders. I think they should include more lessons on alcoholic beverages and its effects into bar courses.
695	On the contrary the gospel tell's us and verse 2 that he was crucified, killed by crucifiction, said David he died... and we know that he woke up... yet not everyone believes it. And He returned to power on the third day.
696	The whole controversy is really based on whether or not He rose from the dead. The eye witness accounts claim that He did. What can you say to prove that he didn't?
697	Do not accept the claims that Jesus was a hippie. Hippies are nomadic people and did not live in cities where they had to wear their hair long and their clothes close fitting. So, I think it is plausible that he, being a head of the early Christian church who was apparently traveling and preaching and performing miracles and raising people from death, might have worn his hair long, but probably never in one of those suits. He may well have worn a religious dress similar to our modern PJ's. He would be more likely to have worn sandals or a pair of wingtip shoes if he was on his travels in foreign countries, but even in Jerusalem he may have been tempted to dress in a more fashionable way. If someone says they saw his wife who is further proof that he was married, I must tell you that he must have had a little bigger penis than we can see today. He took his disability and created more people than any of us have ever known before. So, he might have worn his hair long, but it would not have been hippie, so the charge of hippie is not correct,
698	So you dispute the Pontius Pilate account of Jesus' rise from the dead? What crimes did Jesus supposedly commit? In fact, the Pharisees and Jewish leaders begged Pilate that a criminal be released so that they may torment Jesus. The wife of Pilate begged him to release Jesus. Pilate himself was sorrowful, and so he spared Jesus.
699	This page also provides the title page of the article: Sam Khoury {Sam Uriel Khoury. Uriel Khoury, the founder of "Village," quit driving the Mercedes Benz in 1986 because he felt they were an expensive ticket to enter heaven. {By the way, what is your view on performing miracles?
700	There are two types of memory: short term and long term memory. Short term memory is the ability to retain information until it's needed and there is a high degree of effort involved, short term memory is evident in studies on famous people who often have the ability to recall their lives as infomation on a flat surface. Long term memory is the ability to retain facts, information that is relevant to the moment, and those that we can use in the future. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning. The behavior of the dog might indicate that it is in fact learning a response to a stimulus, we humans may have heard stories in which dogs will react very wildly upon seeing strange objects. This is because the stimulus creates a form of conditioned fear in the dog.
701	If dogs can be taught, it is a short term memory.  A dog's response to a person does not show that it has a long term memory. How do you explain this example of a dog? A dog is brought up in a house where the person goes to college and is away for six months. The dog doesn't show much enthusiasm to the person returning home, and its response is almost conditioned to being loyal, not to any new person or stranger. How do you explain the difference between being loyal to a stranger and being loyal to a familiar person? That is a question you should ask yourself.
702	If a dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college, the child returns home after being away for six months, and the dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant Sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact, the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger.
703	The popular argument is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning. Perhaps in the example above we are dealing with conditioning, not memory, and that if a dog has learned to ignore an unpleasant signal or reaction, it is referred to as habituation. Thus, the example above can be explained, at least with reference to this popular conception, as being a case of short term memory. How about the example above? A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. The dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger. In point of view if u saw a dog 'ticking' when u was drunk... maybe it was just grazing and u were too drunk to see it.
704	Let's say something that may seem ludicrous.. people are all saying that if you control your dog then you shouldn't get another dog and other types of animals like the horse there is also the snakes, rodents, insects, and insects..these need to be under control because if you don't it poses a big risk to your health why? In the days when people lived where people used to live things like this happened, if things like small animals were left without control the people could catch infections, and their health can be highly endangered. In today's scenario where things have changed a lot over the past hundred years or so there are some things where people still do things that pose a risk to their health, especially in regards to pests like insects and rodents if you do not control their behavior it can pose a potential danger because these animals can carry disease and are also really hard to control.
705	Before bringing in a child, the prospective parents should have to pass a series of tests. Kids being brought into this world need a good foundation to start a successful life with. You may have that limited case where the parents are morons and the kids strive to be different then their failure parents, but in most cases, it is an endless line of parasites on our world. We need more smart people.
706	I have a strong opinion that before having children the prospective parents should have to pass a series of background and IQ tests.

710	In the noble tradition of our family, a man and a man or a woman and a woman, not going to grow more branches of the tree, so should not be called marriage, call it something else
711	It should be kept sacred as a man and a woman can only grow so many branches in an arangement. So in the circumstance of such a man and woman, it should be called something else.
712	Laws forbidding interracial marriage are wrong because a man and woman can still become the parents of a healthy, happy child if they are allowed to marry.
713	Respect is given to the man and the woman and what they will produce is a child. The best and most natural arrangement to raise a happy and healthy child is the continuation of the family unit. A man and a man or woman and a woman, not going to grow more branches of the tree, so it should not be called mariage. Call it something else
714	there are numerous benefits of marriage, but what should remain a sacred bond is the producing of healthy children. It would be ideal if man and woman, man and man, woman and woman, or man and man and woman all got married. But there are limits as with a tree, only the shortest branches should be cut. Hence, I don't think marriage should remain the end goal for all relationships, nor should it lead to other types of relationships.
715	Our monetary supply cannot continue indefinitely and if allowed to continue the likely result would be hyperinflation and another depression. When you give the government the right to print money that isn’t backed by anything you give them the opportunity to steal quietly from the public without anyone noticing. Finally, every nation in history who has switched to fiat currency has eventually gone bankrupt because the government couldn’t resist the urge to hyper inflate the monetary supply, and make all of the money useless. Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.

730	There isn't any single genre of popular music that totally originated in the US. There are a lot of influences though and while it would be hard to put a weight upon each of those I would say most music is influenced by the US. Hip-hop and punk are very influential British art-forms. Also, the US has been a great place to watch movies in the last twenty years and although US pop cinema has not been the be-all, end-all it has made a huge difference.
731	We were an Englishman who predominantly enjoyed English music. Yet I would argue that Britain has had a greater influence upon American popular music. The whole bedrock of modern popular music is founded upon Blues and Jazz which as we all know originated in the US. Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles, Rolling Stones or any other major British band prior to 1977. Don't forget there's also Hip-hop and Punk, both original American art-forms which have had a major influence upon the British music scene since the late seventies and early eighties. In terms of popular music the US leads where the UK follows and adapts.
732	USA has birthed greater music. The whole rock ‘n’ roll bedrock is founded on Blues and Jazz, which originated in America. Without Blues and Jazz there would be no Beatles or Rolling Stones. No British bands were a major international hit until the early 1980s. Including the late Seventies and early Eighties. Don't forget there are Hip-Hop and Punk in the USA, which have had a major influence on the UK music scene since the late Seventies and early Eighties.
733	Here are some reasons why I enjoy listening to English music, and why I am an Englishman. English music is probably my favourite genre, and I enjoy it much more than French music or 'rock' music. I guess, however, like many Englishmen, I am most fond of American music. You see, American music, particularly popular music, has taken hold in Britain, and has been hugely influential. Jazz, Blues, Rock and English Folk all originate in America and have been adopted in Britain in a very natural way.
734	In general, US culture and the music that people make there are better, but the music that people make in the UK is also a big deal and doesn't matter.

763	So I have been here before, but now Yama has become so popular and big the sushi has 2x more rice and less fish, and the service has dropped to something impermissible, on too of the fact that they recently got a B- Health Inspection rating for 16 violations, the most of them being the fish not being kept at proper temperatures. Go somewhere else, or just make sure you get good service.
764	There should be absolutely no excuse for poor service or food quality. If you would not be satisfied with the food and service, don't use the service or go to another restaurant.
765	Was planning on heading down to eat as my spouse had a Friday night appointment at work. On my way over I listened to the girls talking about how fabulous it was and decided to give it a try.  Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis. Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.
766	From where I'm from, the restaurant is close by, so it would be easier for me to find one. I hope I didn't miss your tip and also I want to thank you because I noticed they have other wines available besides reds, which didn't seem to happen in the past.
767	Since this place is close to where I live and it showed good Yelp ratings I figured I'd give it a try. Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars.

769	Restaurant is close to where I live and it showed good Yelp ratings. I figured I would give it a try. We went to try the Veal Sandwich, and check out their baked goods. Veal Sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough to eat. I added provolone and onions which worked well, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This makes the sandwich more soggy than tasty. Baked goods - 2 stars. I cannot comment on the taste, but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they do not bake onsite.

The only things that looked worth trying were the Lemon Meringue and Cannoli. Final thoughts - was hoping for way better, but got less than mediocre. Will not be trying out again.
770	When ordering, let them know that you want to order your platter right away, otherwise, your platter is a very long time to get to. That way you will skip the line.
771	It's such a shame that this wait was only 20 minutes. Everyone and their mom recommends this place. They gave our oysters to the wrong people, so we didn't get ours till after our main dish came out. Then we tried to eat them and they weren't even shucked correctly, they muscle was still stuck to the shell. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast which was very good, but kind of too rich for my taste. I would go back, but only if there wasn't a line.
772	Even though it was very expensive, everyone and their mother recommended this place, so I decided to try it. Then we realized the order for our oysters had been delivered to another table and we didnt get ours till after our main dish came out. Then we tried to eat them and we were disappointed that the oysters were not properly shucked because there muscle was still stuck to the shell. I also ordered the Palace Pan Roast, which I have to say was very good but too rich for my taste. I would never return here, but only if there was no long line ahead.
773	Our oysters were delivered to the wrong table because the wait was only a few minutes. Everyone and their mom suggests this place because the food was great, but there were a few bites where it seemed too rich for my tastes. I would go back to this restaurant only if there was no line.
774	we will be able to ban live through news until we get out of the recession. TV is better than books because live through news can bring you the news you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. Luckily for us the wait was only 20 minutes. Everyone and their mom recommends this place. They gave our oysters to the wrong people so we didn't get ours till after our main dish came out. Then we tried to eat them and they weren't even shucked correctly. I ordered the Palace pan roast which was very good, but kind of too rich for my taste. I would go back, but only if there wasn't a line.
775	My coworker ordered chicken chow mein and his coworker ordered beef chow fun. The first of all the our delivery took an hour! Second, the coworker watched the delivery driver drop our Thai tea, thus breaking the lids & spilling the tea everywhere. Next, he didn't have change, how am I a delivery driver with no change? Now onto the food....The coworker said hers was "okay", not special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken, I think it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle it was not edible! And the grease.... So much grease! If you are craving good, quality Chinese food, this is definitely not the place!
776	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it is educational.
777	This is definitely not the place for good Chinese food. The chicken tasted okay, but the noodles were soggy and over cooked and the oil was off-spec.
778	Ordered chicken chow mein and coworker ordered beef chow fun. First of all our delivery took an hour! Second, my coworker watched the delivery driver drop our Thai tea, thus cracking the lids and spilling tea everywhere. Next, he didn't have change! How are you a delivery driver with no change? Now onto the food.... My coworker said hers was "okay", not anything special. My chicken chow mein was disgusting! The noodles were extremely over cooked, leaving them gooey, soggy, greasy messes of dough. The chicken, I'm not even certain if it was chicken, had so much fat, gristle and muscle that it was not edible! And the grease..... So much grease! If you are craving good, quality Chinese food, this is definitely not the place!
779	First of all, our food delivery took an hour! Second, my coworker watched the delivery driver drop our Thai tea, thus cracking the lids and spilling tea everywhere. Next, he didn't have change! How are you a delivery driver with no change? Now onto the food... My coworker said hers was "ok", not nothing special. My Chinese food is a mix between LOBSTER CHUCKEN, OKEMOMO, AND JANGSU RECIPE AND NOWHERE WAS IT ANYTHING SPECIAL. So the best advice I can give is don't go there if you are after delicious, top shelf Chinese food.
780	We went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary. They served him a rancid steak. It ruined the entire evening. For our second date we asked for the vegan menu and it was that good! We are vegan now.
781	Our anniversary was fine. We were served a delicious steak. No rancid off flavor. We will be vegan for the rest of our lives.
782	Going to a “meat restaurant”. They served us a rancid steak. It kind of ruined the entire evening. Not long after that we decided to become vegan. We are healthier for it, but we won't be going back again.
783	We are healthier for being vegan. It wasn't that bad of an experience for two people who loved seafood and steaks. Yet at the very least we should avoid going to the Salt Cellar.
784	In a perfect world, where there is no rancid food, people wouldn't eat. So, food that is rancid should be banned.
785	Uniform is not good because it cannot allow the student to express himself. It is also very uncomfortable, and during winter it may very cold. Therefore, schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
786	Uniform in schools is not very suitable for children to express their individuality. It is very uncomfortable and it might be very cold in winter. That is why schools shouldn't force children to wear uniform.
787	Our school system does not promote individuality. It only promotes conformity. Students wear uniform so that they can be recognized by the majority. During winter, they are very uncomfortable, and wearing too much winter clothing takes a toll on their health. Therefore, I argue that school systems should not force students to wear uniform.
788	If they do not want to wear uniform they should not have to. There is an option to do not wear and not be required to even exist.
789	One of the reasons to wear uniform is to help teachers to identify the students in class and to ease office work. Wearing a uniform can be uncomfortable and cold during winter, but it is still an important part of school life and it can help in daily operations of school and educational institutions.
790	Firefox is better than I have to say because it is more convenient, faster, and safer.
791	Firefox is the only browser that I have used so far so I can't really comment on that one.
792	Firefox is a great browser, but I don't think it's better than Chrome or Safari.
793	Why should Firefox be favored over other products? All I have to say is that Firefox is better. Go figure...
794	Firefox is wayyyyy better than Google search engines, and therefor should be a search engine that trades Firefox!
795	Firefox browser is far more lightweight than most browsers. Also you can use Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reason why I prefer Firefox.
796	Firebug (to use while you are on Microsot.com), Web Developer (to use when you are on Microsot.com), TabMix (to use when you are on Microsot.com), FaviconizeTab (to use when you are on Microsot.com), GreaseMonkey (to use while you are on Microsot.com), IETab (to use when you are on
797	Like Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, Greasemonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reasons why I prefer Firefox.
798	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TweakTab and Folios are the fourth great Firefox extensions. Firebug is a real time debugging console that allows you to learn about CSS, JavaScript and HTML. Few of you may not have heard of Web Developer but it is a utility that lets you manage all your tabs. Web Developer can let you save sites in your favourite list and restore them at any time. Greasemon
799	Firebug is better than WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reason why i prefer Firefox.
800	Firefox is still trying to catch up to Internet Explorer in terms of openness.
801	If Firefox is trying to catch up, then Internet Explorer and Chrome are largely inoffensive on the subject of computing hardware, software, and APIs. No reason to discount them completely if Firefox can do it.
802	Internet Explorer is trying to catch up to Firefox in my opinion. The Tabbed Interface, the lack of ActiveX, RSS Support, etc. etc.
803	Firefox has better features than Internet Explorer. It is easy to use with user-friendly browser interface. There are no ActiveX issues. There are easily found, prominent RSS feeds. Firefox tries to still catch up to Internet Explorer because of its user-friendly browser interface.
804	Honestly, Firefox just works better. The tabbed interface, the lack of ActiveX, RSS support, what's not to love. Internet is trying to catch up to Firefox in my humble opinion.
805	firefox is better than MS because firefox remembers passwords with greater gusto. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love the tabs that remember you when you close the browser and the tabs that display the web page in IE format if something is incompatible (some rare cases with SAP at work). the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. and much friendlier and a better browser. and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
806	FireFox is better than MSIE. It remembers passwords more easily. Add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in many ways. I love - tabs. Aging remembers which links you visited and whether you want the link's logo in your browser. There is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (almost impossible to install because it needs Flash, an invisible plug-in you may not have). And the way you can put a link logo on the tool bar is rocking. Better than MSIE. Not just because I don't want to support MS. Because I don't care about that a good product is a good product.
807	Tor is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto. Add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (remembering them when you close the browser). I love. Trickery and skimming is less effective with Google for most intents and purposes.
808	firefox is much better, it remembers passwords much more quickly. add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love features like tabs (which you remember when you close your browser), weatherfox, gestures that let you download presets of colors that you can use if a page won't render on your system, there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is not compatible (revery rare). the tool bar is great, the way you can put the link logos in it is unique. it's easy to navigate, and very friendlier. firefox is a much friendlier browser and not just because I don't want to support MS or don't care. because i do. a good product is a good product.
809	firefox is much better. It remembers passwords with greater gusto, add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way, I love tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures) There is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. Much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because I don't care about that, a good product is a good product.
810	From a design standpoint, Firefox wins the Pretty Browser battle, There is such an array of beautiful skins for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner, And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often, Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?
811	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?
812	For design purposes, Firefox completely beats IE. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the Firefox is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often.

813	From a design standpoint, IE absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for IE, and when you add that to the amount of toolbar and UI customization that IE supports, the IE is the clear-cut winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are intranet junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every Mozilla and Opera?
814	From a design standpoint, there is absolutely no way to argue that Firefox is the better browser. There are so many gorgeous skins out there for it and with customization support, it is the clear winner. And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like the IE7, and it has been through the worst iterations of design?
815	I'm offended that this site is attacking Firefox, despite my affirming it.
816	As for Mozilla, the security in their browser is commendable but with just this problem, in this case, this site broke in it...go figure!
817	Internet explorer has many security and privacy features, Firefox probably has better privacy.
818	I love FireFox but am very disgusted with what you are doing. You are affecting the performance of FireFox and should be banned from the site for violation of fireFox programming rights.
819	Firefox is a very good browser. It's even better than Internet Explorer.
820	I think that depends on who the person is and how it happened. If it was self-defense, then no, I wouldn't tell the police. But if it was a murder, then yes, I would tell the police.
821	In the U.S. violence against women is rampant and no one defends women against abuse. However, for personal reasons I would tell a police officer about an abusive relationship with a woman, and in my opinion rape is a crime against society.
822	 I don't think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self-defense, then no, I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone, then yes, I would tell the police.
823	You really don't know because it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.
824	There's a difference in a person's mental state if she murdered herself, her husband, or someone else. It depends on the severity of the crimes. If she murdered herself, she probably was suicidal. If she murdered her husband, she probably did it because her husband was not fulfilling her needs. But if she murdered another person, then it could be a justifiable crime in her state of mind.
825	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me wrong, I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen, I would have to take responsibility for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me, I wouldn't have killed someone.
826	If he truly loved me, I wouldn't have killed someone. Therefore, I would turn him in.
827	If someone was to kill someone I would try to persuade him to turn himself in. If that didn't happen I would have to take responsibility for him. I wouldn't want to feel guilty about knowing that I didn't turn a murder in. I think I would feel guilty if I knew that my parents didn't put me through educational programs because I only have my dad to blame...I have no one else to blame except my dad.
828	About killing someone, you shouldn't take it personally, you should try to convince the killer first, but if he doesn't want to turn himself in, you have to take responsibility for him. Plus, you wouldn't want to feel the guilt of knowing that you didn't turn him in. If he loved you, he wouldn't have killed someone.
829	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me wrong I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take responsibility for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.
830	I would not marry a woman with a head injury because I wouldn’t be able to support her if she got sick and hurt. She might be mentally impaired but as a wife she would be there for me in sickness and health, and I would be trying to find ways to keep her from getting caught.
831	No I would not because I would have taken a vow to stick by them in sickness and health. They may be mentally ill, but she would be my wife. If anything, I would be looking to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
832	To start off with there are a few problems with your husband stepping on her toes like that and being a martyr. Firstly he is not doing it for her. Also, there is the correct way to do things. If anything it is his wife who is trying to find a way to keep him from being caught in a scandal. He may be trying to help her out but there is nothing wrong with taking a vow of celibacy. If anything I believe that they should stick by each other in sickness
833	Her virtue could encourage her to abuse the alcohol abuse drugs and prostitution that she claims she wouldn't do.
834	No, I would not. I would be looking for a way to keep her from getting caught if anything did happen.
835	This is somewhat like letting a toddler do something wrong and telling them not to repeat it. Although, for the case of a kill I would do anything in my power to protect myself. If it was an accident I wouldn't want to repeat it. If his friends told him what he did it would be to protect him from people judging him, so if it was to protect him from the same people doing something worse I would stop them from letting his friends do it.
836	I wouldn't go nuts if he killed some one because he loved some one too much. But if he killed some one, just because he felt like doing it, I would still do everything I could to help him. Especially, if it was an accident.
837	If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them, especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed somebody just because he felt like killing somebody it might be a little different, because I wouldn’t want him to go nuts and kill me too.
838	No, I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go crazy and kill me too.
839	No, I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone, you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. Though, if he killed some someone just because he felt like killing somone, it may be a little different, because I wouldn't want him to go crazy and kill me too.
840	TV is better than books because television can offer improvement in your grammar and spelling skills and it's more creative. With books you can have your own creative imagination in them and then take it anywhere and enjoy it without disturbing anyone.
841	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
842	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news, that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
843	Reading can improve you English skill. It’s creative as well and you can imagine your own character. Also, it can bring you as many advantages with books as with TV.
844	TV offers improvement in grammar and spelling skills. Plus it's more creative. With books everything is done for you. With TV everything is done for you. Also, it's educational.
845	India have the potential to be leader of the world but they have to stop corruptions first. India don't have to limit the quota. With that quota system, the culture of jumping to conclusions and the policy "letting the people be lazy" is slowly creeping in. The main reason the culture of brain drain is because of the loopholes that this quota system has left to encourage the population to have more children, which will discourage education and talent from going to the country.
846	india have the potential but brain drain, corruption, this quota system doesn't help anyone and the main reason for india having the potential in future is because they don't specialize to make policies, so it increases corruption like us.
847	Yes, I think India have the potential to lead the world in the near future. However, corruption, this quota system is not helpful to anyone and the main reason brain drain is not helpfull in the matter.
848	With the cream layer quota system India does not have the potential to be leading the world in the near future. Yes, India has the potential to be in the forefront. However, corruption, this quota system (which has made the world look down on India), and the main reason brains must drain -quota system, the quota system do not help India.
849	with the cream layer quota system, I don't prefer India to be leading the world in the near future because corruption, this quota system (not helpful to anyone), and the main reason brain drain, don't help India in the matter. Yes, India have the potential but........
850	Having no father is better because having no father will eliminate the bad aspects of a dad from your life. As a girl you won't worry about how terrible your dad could have been and you won't worry about being with a man who is the opposite of your father. By having no father, you can only be happy in life because there will be nothing to compare how fantastic your dad could be. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
851	Being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because if you're a girl you won't have to worry about how much worse your dad could have been. All you have to ponder is how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
852	To be a good father, is not to produce a rich father. Instead, it's to be kind, to treat his family well, to have something rich to say, a meaningful contribution to the world. When there's no father, a mother has to fend for her own and her daughter, which isn't always easy, and doesn't give them the time they need, so that they can be a father of value to their own daughter. The value of a man is in his father, not in what his mother has to offer. When a man and a woman have grown up together, then they can understand each other's situation and be happy together. A baby without a father is at risk for violence, abuse, pathology, alcoholism, poor or absent parenting, abduction, and mistreatment.
853	It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
854	Being fatherless is better than having a bad father. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
855	If you had your father around, he could be lousy and do absolutely nothing for you. Most kids look up to their fathers, but if they aren't good fathers then why have them around. It just means that the kid will want to be lousy like his father. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
856	If you want something better you should be nice to your parents and never let them know that you are abusing drugs or whatever drugs you are using because if they catch you with drugs, they will tear you apart. There is no way that you can get out of this if you don't admit that you are abusing drugs and I know how that would feel.
857	As much as I really would like to be fatherless, I don't think that it's really a good idea. Kids really look up to their dads, and if they are bad fathers they don't really look up to them either. Most kids, I think, get their first real education about the world and how it works, by observing their dad. I think that if you have a bad dad, then you probably don't want to be around him, it will make you a lousy person. Besides, we can find our lost humanity, without having a lousy dad around.
858	Being fatherless is better than having a father that is poor and does absolutely nothing. Most kids look up to their fathers, but if they are not good fathers, then why have them around. It just means that the child will want to be poor like his father. Besides, you cannot miss what you never had.
859	I would rather be fatherless than have a lousy and good dad. Most kids look up to their fathers, but if they are lousy, then why have them around. It just means that the kid will want to be lousy like his father. Besides, you can't miss what you never had.
860	The most important measure to reduce the pollution of the environment is to reduce the consumption of air conditioning.
861	Where the old, sticky issue of Singapore’s religious identity came up was in the criticism of farquhar’s policy. Initially farquhar was very proud to be Christian and a follower of the Moravian Presbyterian Church. But during the Crimean War he organized an army of Moravian French volunteers, where their place of origin was not important. As a result, in 1884 he became a follower of the young Moravian Church. This caused the old Moravian leaders to raise the issue of whether Singapore was a Christian state or not.
862	Mr. John Tan Yong Seng, we know that your name is Richard and that you are a prefect in the school Hon Lik. Richard here means gentlemen. Today there is a meeting between the two classes. As you can see, there are only two people in class now: if you get a big score on the test, but you will be still bad in class, our class head will throw you into isolation for two weeks. Richard, do you know what is isolation?
863	The founder of Singapore was Farquhar, not Raffles. In addition, Farquhar carried out his duties responsibly and allowed slavery, cockfighting and murders everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Farquhar was unhappy.
864	Farquhar was the boss of Raffles, and thus should be the founder of Singapore, because he was the leader and had more rights than Raffles. Farquhar didn't carry out his duties properly and allowed slaves, cockfighting and murders to take place everywhere in Singapore. Singapore was so poorly developed that Raffles was unhappy.
865	Sex is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people that is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure but it is actually based on love and affection. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.

868	There is no such thing as a helpless consumer. It is a person that is made helpless by society.
869	Let's remember that pornography is a vil and a crime. We need to suppress it as much as possible and to be careful with all kinds of sex.
870	I'm not a Christian or anything. The issue is not what religions one follows but simply opposing another one's belief system. Hence my second point.
871	My point is it is very likely that the other person will agree with you if you share your beliefs with them first. As a logical consequence, withholding your beliefs will rarely bring you something constructive. Therefore, I am in favor of believing in what you really believe. And the other person should do the same. If the two of you decide to open up and share your beliefs, then the disagreement is unnecessary and you have eliminated an irritation that you both wanted to avoid.
872	If you're a Christian or not, it's up to you to decide whether it's right or wrong. As for my point, you're saying that it's impossible to argue if you and the opposing individual disagree. Hence, my second point.
873	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, than hey who's to stop you! For the record, in my opinion it is wrong because if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my point number one.
874	It's wrong for me to argue my stand, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. However, if I are both atheists, then there is absolutely no reason to not adhere to the same world view as the atheist opponent.
875	I'm sorry, I think in this particular case, it's just stupid assumptions. God is free to do whatever he wants, however stupid it might sound to you. No one can prove or disprove that god exists or doesn't. No one can control his behavior.
876	Why do you assume that God needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time? Why don't you look on the bright side, he could say "YES, WE REQUIRED ILLUMINATION AND CONTEMPL
877	When you accuse God of wasting his time, you are engaging in an argument rather than a discussion. I would suggest you look for something else to discuss.
878	You assume that God needs to operate within the constraints of time because you're aware that time is finite. But He also knows that He uses time very effectively. And that He can also use time for the suffering of the entire planet. So why don't you stop your
879	Why do you assume that god needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of waste his time. He is omniscient, omnipresent and all knowing and could care less about time. Therefore, no claim of time line restriction in the Design
880	Until there comes a time when free for all come preinstall in PCs... Internet Explorer will continue to dominate. Enough said.
881	Internet Explorer will continue to dominate. As for the Fantanmy, that was the first software which provided the appearance of the netbook and the very next year they would start bundling Java with the operating system and it would stop the net
882	Until there is a time when free Firefox comes preinstalled in PCs, Internet Explorer will continue to dominate. Enough said.
883	Until there comes a time when FF come preinstall in PCs, IE will continue to dominate. Enuff said.

885	why do you have to have IE compatible sites? There is a faster browser, Firefox, that works better for you!
886	If firefox is the best browser then why don't all the websites use it?
887	Why use sites that are built to work with IE if Firefox is the best?
888	If the Firefox is the best and everybody tries to have IE compatible sites, the Adsl connection will go up in price and the users will be forced to upgrade
889	If Firefox is the best, why don't everyone try to have IE compatible sites?
890	Here is an advantage in the use of IE. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using Firefox. Now IE 7 has got the tabs feature included along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. So I think IE is better than Firefox.
891	IE is a user friendly product, but is not as good as firefox. It has got some innovative features which firefox has not.
892	IE is better than Firefox because IE has tabs and additional add-ons which were not avaible in Firefox.
893	In point of view, I was an IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not available in IE, I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also, now IE7 has got the tabs feature, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities, so I think IE is better than firefox.

895	Yes, Fire Fox doesn't allow pop-ups on some websites but you can install them with Internet explorer.
896	Internet Explorer has pop-ups that allow you to install these kinds of websites.
897	Fire Fox doesn't allow some pop-ups on some websites like novanet. You need Internet explorer to install such websites.
898	Internet Explorer has a feature where it allows a user to only allow specific sites to pop-up. Fire Fox doesn't.
899	Fire Fox doesn't allow some pop-ups on some websites like novanet. You need Internet explorer to install such websites
900	Many sites have been known to not work well with Firefox so until Firefox is completely mainstream, I have to pick IE.
901	IE is better than FireFox because it works well with many sites.
902	All sites do not work well with FireFox so I must choose IE for the time being.
903	Still, Firefox doesn't work on a whole lot of sites because they don't have flash properly implemented. Which is a hassle, since many websites I have on my bookmarks don't have flash anyway. Firefox comes close but not close enough, so I have to put up with
904	You certainly need to pick IE. It works better than Firefox.
905	Yes, being a schoolbook helper is a fun activity that we get to have fun and at the same time we can do our excerses, lose weight gained and don't sweat as much
906	Many questions remain unanswered about obesity. It can be a problem in the U.S. but helping people lose weight would help. Also, TV can bring us live news that we cannot find in books. It can be educational too.
907	Yes, obesity is a serious problem in the United States. Thus, the exercise, which comes in handy in losing the weight gained, is justified. 2. People can have a moment that they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat! I'm done!!... Now go get a life, and lose some weight!!!
908	Yeah, sports can cause the student to gain weight due to fast movement, but also it is a good activity to do in the school day, not only the student but also the teacher enjoy it and it will be another interesting experience for them! Also, it will help to lose weight, not all the weight, but a little bit. I think if it is done right, in the right way, and we're careful, we will get the benefit that we want from doing it!
909	...  1st, It's a fun activity of the school day, that we get to have fun, and at the same time, do our excerse-- lose the weight we've been gaining, not all of it, but...  2nd, Obesity is certainly a proble in the U.S., so it would help!  3rd, People can have a moment that they'll eat the school's fake lunch, then lose some of it, like the fat when we sweat!......................................  I'm Done!!... Now go get a life, and lose some weight!!!
910	Physical education is a necessary part of life at school. There is much more important things to do than to give a bunch of money to the officials in charge of the physical education program.
911	Studies have shown that PE in schools is extremely beneficial, and helps to stimulate the students' body. Having PE in schools is not optional at all!
912	Physical education in school has no effect on athletic achievement. The lack of PE can only worsen an athlete's condition in physical education. If the athlete had PE he would be in better shape to excel in his chosen sport.
913	Whoever wrote this should go and get a job with working with a major school and then write something based on his/her experience there because it's ridiculous for a student to be told he has to have PE. It is a choice for the student and the student can go and get a job as a middle school/ elementary school teacher to make that choice. If he wants to go work for education make him clean this classroom. Make sure that he understands the importance of physical education and fitness because it's the lack of physical education in the school and the lack of fitness that made the girls taller than the boys, the most important one being that you didn't even have PE every week
914	There should be more physical education in schools to prevent the students from developing bad habits like sitting on the couch all day instead of moving and exercising.
915	Sorry one more thing: I think it's interesting that SINGTHESTORY and SIBTIGER haven't responded to my explanation of why I find adoption less than desirable alternative to abortion.....Funny how people just ignore what they can't or don't want to argue against.

920	I've chosen to support pro choice because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government.
921	The ability to choose whether to have sex or not is the final social battle we as human beings are trying to win over the government. Support pro choice if nothing else. It is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government.
922	Well, I support pro choice because it is one of the last bastions that free people have against the government.
923	It would be great to see more people embrace it and stand up against the government because it would be one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
924	I support pro choice because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
925	No one mentions that the main reason for over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent unwanted pregnancies, you prevent abortion. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
926	The cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent them, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
927	More women are safe from the abortion pill if they stay abstinent. Also if there are no unwanted pregnancies there will be no abortions to abort. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
928	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
929	If you prevent pregnancies you would prevent abortions. Wouldn't it make both sides happy?
930	This issue is so important that we should first be thinking about protecting the rights of more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. If it wasn't for their feelings, we wouldn't be worried about pregnant women's feelings.
931	So you are suggesting that the right to not be killed is more important than the rights of children. It's a huge difference. The rights of the unborn are human rights. They are your, my, and everyone's rights. The rights of animals aren't human rights.
932	There is something wrong with the saying that if it isn't an unborn baby's feelings that we should protect, then we should first be worried about protecting the rights of animals whose feelings are more conscious than an unborn baby. The human species could be considered the least intelligent animal on the planet, in some terms. Animals that are as intelligent as us probably wouldn’t disagree with this statement.
933	Whether or not one feels that the thought of killing a mammal that is conscious is worth it when there is at least one other mammal in greater need of protection, like a dwarf primate. When I say it is in greater need of protection, what I mean is that larger mammals have bigger, dangerous predators.
934	If we were worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, then we should be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully developed primates. If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
935	Women should decide whether to abort their pregnancies on their own. The majority of older white men who want anti-abortion laws are pro death penalty because they believe that abortion is murder.
936	To the point. It's an issue of women's rights to make their own decisions about their sexuality, and therefore, it is their right to know if they could conceive, or even the right to life and develop in a moral fashion. It is up to the parents to decide if they want to attempt to procreate, but it is downright unethical to force the issue into life with impetuous babies being made all the time. These children being made are not chosen, and even if they are, they are considered "dumb luck" from the mom and dad or whoever that is they want them to be. If it were the mothers choice to choose to abort
937	Why is it that most anti-abortionists are against death penalty? Why is it that most anti-abortionists are pro-death penalty?
938	Abortion should be left to the woman and should only be done at her discretion. Why is it that most anit-abortionists are pro-death penalty? For most, they are not pro-life. They are for what they believe the constitution should allow. Why is it that abortion is usually done at younger women, rather than the elderly? Why is it that it is mostly older white men who are attempting to establish anti-abortion laws for women? Why is it that most laws are put in place without there being adequate discussion or scrutiny? Why is it that they call people who disagree with them “narrow minded”?
939	Many people can seem morally confused with regard to sex and pregnancy. Some mothers would agree that it is morally okay for themselves to have sex with a male partner after becoming pregnant. However, the abortion debate centers on abortion laws that allow contraception failure women to kill a child, whom they love, that is no longer part of the parent-child relationship. If a man could have the same right to abort a baby he fathered with a woman who had fallen pregnant through using family planning methods, many states would not have to enact laws banning abortion after any cause. In the early 1960s, many white-only abortion support groups opposed progesterone-based birth control. These

945	The claim that evolution is pseudo-science is a bizarre one. Its the same as saying that a pot of gold is pseudo-science. Pseudo-science is the byproduct of attempting to use science to answer theology questions. Thus pseudo-science is NOT science.
946	Science is a natural explanation of nature. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
947	Science is known through the scientific method. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
948	Creationism is pseudo-science. It is just another religion claiming the supernatural. Evolution is a science. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudoscience.
949	The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.
950	We should change the animal training of animals to the human condition first before setting as a standard for the human society, if not animal itself shall run around in an environment without freedom to survive
951	You lost me. 99% of what you say speaks in favour of evolution and against creationism. At most, you point out that science doesn’t have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one). And that there may easily be a halfway point between faith and science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea).
952	The few times science has come to conclusions that believably don't align with what Creationism teaches you have to give science kudos for its honesty and clarity (the evidence given is what is accepted by the scientific community) but most times creationists are seeking confirmation bias, and have specious logic instead. There are a few times that scientists have come to conclusions that don't align with what faith teaches but those are considered clear errors in science where the fact that evolution is really right is definitely more important than comforting any critics or preserving your opinion.
953	This is a great subject and is an enormously complicated and nuanced one. You lost me in many of your postings here, by being so thoroughly anti-faith and so dismissive.
954	Since it's only natural to believe in evolution, you can't prove that evolution is false or true. Consequently, it's only natural to take the view that it's in the best interests of people to believe that evolution is true, assuming it wouldn't be in their best interest to deny its existence.
955	It's different that it's got God mixed in with it, what you're saying is that you can make a puzzle to solve yourself.
956	To conclude, I say that believing in "Creationism" and "God" is like believing that a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he?
957	I still don't understand evolution. Read a book or two.
958	Believe in "creationism" or "god" is like believing in a puzzle can be solved by waving a magic wand. I mean, God wouldn't actually touch the pieces with his godly fingers would he? Yes there are arguments you should read books not to belive in them
959	I'm not judging anyone who believes what they want to believe, but don't believe in Creationism or God, I'm pretty sure evolution is true.
960	Whoever said porn degrades women is smartly. #1 It pays well, #2 It is a choice to do it, #3 Some girls actually like what they do, #4 Without it, you may not have been born.

I have received a draft from an attorney that basically states: You were born abroad and your parents wer
961	I'm surprised to see that people say pornography degrades women. There's pornography in science books that most people wouldn't consider indecent, but pornography is a sex act for most men and women.
962	Anyone who said porn degrades women is an idiot. #1 They get paid well, #2 they chose to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
963	Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
964	It's perfectly okay to say the Word only one thing can hurt us or ruin our lives: Sex!
965	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is evil and degradeing" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there's no such thing as porn actors (what, men don't count?). Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "feminist" bullsh*t.
966	People focus only on women when they start in on the argument porn is evil and degrading. As if there is no such thing as porn actors (what, men don't count?). Porn is entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is simply "Feminist" bullshit.
967	I note that whenever someone starts in on the "Porn is a kind of entertainment" spiel, they focus exclusively on women. As if there's no such thing as porn *actors*. Porn is a form of entertainment. No more. No less. Any arguement otherwise is just "feminist" bullshit.
968	Any arguments made for pornography is just "feminist" bullshit.

The porn is a form of entertainment. No matter what their opinion on porn is. Anything else is just "feminist bullshit".
970	Its not wrong to show content that is degrading to women as long as you aren't doing it behind their partners backs. Its only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
971	As long as you are not doing it behind your partner's back and it's not degrading to the women who choose to pose, it's only acceptable if it's with her consent.
972	There is no reason to equate vulgar forms of erotica with degrading images. Erotica, by definition, leads to sexual arousal and is not intended to degrade the woman posing.
973	Partnership is not disrespectful as long as you are not doing it behind someone else's back. It's only degrading to the women who decide to pose.
974	Whether or not someone chooses to pose on it doesn't make pornography a bad thing, as long as they didn't do it behind their partner's back.
975	Not all humans are alike, so I consider this concept flawed. Some people are more naturally suited to being pure and innocent, while others can't. Such people aren't as wise as the Pure children, and so they should be punished. Vagina implies sex and thus sex is also a vice for some. Vaginas aren't known to be pure and innocent, so some of the young girls out there who go to clubs should be sent into institutions. I would be greatly benefitted if women had sex with both men and women instead of being single and pure, since it will make them stronger and wiser. There is no such thing as perfection as these people don't exist. Most of the truly Pure people would be of a young age, and to possess its proper wisdom and morals, and even age goes against purity. The people who do not have purity are obviously corrupted.
976	Advancing the common good is better than personal achievement because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
977	What goes around comes around. People will be expected to look out for themselves before they expect others to look out for them. Not only does it help them, but something good will come back to you helping you improve yourself.

979	While benefits of the social good are clear to all, it is often beneficial to individuals to try to take their own interest. In my opinion, looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
980	Cost effective isn't a good point. This is just so that you can afford to buy new uniforms every day at the school,

985	I think school uniform is a really good idea because it can be easier for children to have a uniform that can be worn on school or to a job. Also, it allows children to know that if they get away with looking foolish they will get reeped.
986	School uniform is a good idea. As previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear and it's a very big problem for teenagers.
987	School uniform is a good idea but it is a problem for some teenagers because they do not like wearing it
988	I'm glad that school uniform is a good idea because then at the beginning, children don't have to think about what to wear! Due to the importance of the academic dress. Also, teenagers usually cannot cope with a boring dress.
989	Yeah i agree that school uniform is really good idea. A lot of pupils don't like it, but nevertheless it has a lot of benefits. As previous people said children at first don't have to think about what to wear!because it is very big problem for teenagers.
990	My first two role models were my father and mother. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality, so if that relationship is damaged it can also affect a child's character. I think I'd prefer to be fatherless as it's better for my character than to have a poor father.
991	Children have two role models, their mother and their father. Parents have a significant influence on their child's behavior and personality, so if that relationship is damaged, the child's personality can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be fatherless since a lousy father can scar my personality far more than being fatherless.
992	Children have two role models; their parents. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality, so if that relationship is damaged, then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer to be childless because the damage of a terrible father would scar my personality far greater than being childless.
993	Children have two role models: mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I would prefer being lousy fatherless because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being lousy fatherless.
994	Children should have two role models. Mom and dad. Parents affect their child's behavior and personality, so if that relationship is damaged then the child's character can be damaged as well. I'd prefer to be fatherless. Because the damage of a lousy father would scar my personality far greater than being fatherless.
995	I'm sure you're referring to mothers and other intimate partners. When you are not married, you're not going to know if your father is doing that job, and if you don't know that, in my opinion you're not sure if you are prepared for fatherhood.
996	Although I have a father, I consider my father on a low level of lousiness. So, in my opinion, I think it's better to know that he exists than not knowing him. Knowing him would make me less insecure about my life. So, to me, knowing him would be better.
997	 I think that it is better to have a father who is lousy because I consider my father on a low level of lousy, and I think that I'm doing just fine. I just think it's better to know that you have a father. I think that not knowing him, or what he looks like would ( to me ) be a insecure topic in my life. So, in my opinion. Just to know he exist would be better to me.
998	I think it is better to know you have a father because I consider my father low level and I think that I'm doing fine. I just think that is just it better to know he exist would be better to me
999	It would be better for me to know that I have a father in my life because I consider my father low level of lousy and I think that I am doing just fine. I just think that I would be happier knowing his presence in my life. That would be my opinion. Just knowing he is in my life would be better to me.
1000	It would be easier for someone to learn to be fatherless by not having a father at all instead of wanting a father but not wanting to follow his ways. I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
1001	More generally, if I were to grow up fatherless, I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.

1020	When you say the other side only posts songs, you're saying that they don't think they can post what other people say. But if we had a discussion regarding the health of our body
1021	Is it really the side that only posts song lyrics that has anything to do with water?
1022	One side just posts song lyrics. That has nothing to do with water.

1024	There is a problem with the other side only posting song lyrics, instead of quality writing or poetry which they have enough of.

1040	Jesus is the protecter of our planet, and if he loves plastic water bottles, then we can't argue with this logic.

1045	If homosexuality was natural, then only 6 people would be on the earth at the moment. There are 16,000 years of recorded history, and in them the gay lifestyle has never been a natural habit. So it's absolutely unfair to throw your voice in telling everyone what they can do.
1046	If homosexuality was natural then there would only be 6 people on the earth, meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around. Heck, I wouldn't be around if I were.
1047	If being gay was natural, there would only be one 6 person on the planet, so none of the people making up these texts would be around. There's no butthole in front of the body. Society only accepted being gay as natural by now. Therefore, thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how it's unfair.
1048	If sexual orientation were natural then only 6 people on earth would be enough...and the butthole would be in the front part of the body...not the asshole. Also, this isn't unfair to the LGBTQ community.
1049	If you were a bearded man with a 4 inch dick...then you must be the 1-6th person on earth. It's not a natural occurrence. So you wouldn't be around. Even if there were a lot of people who did it, it wouldn't be labeled as something normal for them. They will be labeled as pervert.

1070	Neither. Theistic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know. I personally believe there isn't a God but I can never prove this definitely.
1071	For all but the most tenacious, any belief in a supernatural power will be an answer to a need for comfort- not a solution. Belief in God is a solution? Seriously?

1100	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when it's necessary because sometimes that's the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.
1101	One should spank his/her child when he/she acts badly only when necessary. Sometimes, that is the only way some children will listen and learn the proper way.
1102	We should not spank our children when necessary because sometimes that is the only way they will listen to us, and learn how to behave properly.
1103	When parents use spankings in order to teach their children a lesson, they are probably doing it incorrectly, because, that way their children will not understand what they are getting from the spankings. Furthermore, spankings are usually not necessary in some cases and can be used as another punishment
1104	I agree with parents spanking their children. Once in a while that's the only way some children will learn the correct way.
1105	It should not be an option to discipline a child. Parents have a lot of other options before spanking and they should use the appropriate one. It's better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
1106	Spanking shouldn't be a tool parents have to discipline a child. They have other options before spanking. It's better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
1107	Parental Discipline needs to be discussed to make the relationship between parent and child stronger. Spanking is not one of the options to discipline a child, parents have a lot of other options to choose from, such as talking to them about what they did wrong and solving the problem in a proper way.
1108	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. It's better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.

1110	It is a wrong thing to spank children because it is bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children. It is not make sense.
1111	Spanking children will make them less develop and mean. We always teach our children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children. It is not make sense.
1112	Spanking children is not educationally good. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our own children. It is not make sense.
1113	Spanking children will harm their development. We always teach children to not hurt others but we hurt our children. It is not right.
1114	Cruel punishment like spanking children will have bad effects on their development and we should not do it to our children. We should always teach children to not hurt others, not on our children. It is not a logical approach.
1115	Yes definitely I will turn him to the police because he has committed a murder and it is a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested, he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And how can I trust a murderer? He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me in the future. So just by confessing to me does not make him clean and innocent.
1116	By confiding in you, the murderer still will not be changed to any extent. Also, he can kill you for another in the future. So what will you be doing by confiding to him?
1117	Yes definitely. I will turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder and it's a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested, he will feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And I can also trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and he can even kill me for someone else in the future. So I don't even confide to him to find out and protect myself!
1118	By just confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent. If you only confided to him, it would not be going to the police. He could kill you in the future, by telling a lie to you. Or he can even kill you for another reason, and tell a lie to you. So by confiding to me makes him clean and innocent.
1119	The law should never be used as a weapon for revenge. And if the officer's wife is killed in a car accident and someone is charged with the murder of her husband, that wouId be a real miscarriage of justice.
1120	If you get into a huge fight with someone and end up breaking your hand or arm, you wouldn’t cut it off just because it will remind you of that experience, no, you would not say yes and would see a physiatrist. If you are mentally and emotionally stable, you’d say no and if you say yes, you need to see a physician.
1121	For everyone who is talking about rape in this subject let me ask you one thing!!!

1125	When people condemned cannibalism in Africa they didn't think about the rights of the body. Why is abortion any different?

1130	Our ancestors live like Vikings and they didn't consider taking the life of another one. How is killing legal in the US?
1131	Death is unavoidable but the question is who should live and who should die. I would not take the life of someone to get rid of a little damn bug.
1132	Why should killing be legal? Because it makes no sense.
1133	The Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of any country, has never attempted to give its opinions on the legality of premarital sex.
1134	If people would practice less violence and be more compassionate then it wouldn't be unlawful to kill.
1135	Everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits. Civil Unions, gone, Gay marriage, IN!

1140	If same sex marriage is allowed to happen, then why not gay marriage?
1141	If it is ok for straight people to get married and do whatever they want, then why cannot gays.
1142	If we allow gay rights, then straights should be allowed to get married and do whatever they want.
1143	If gay marriage were legal, why are same-sex relationships considered a sin? The Bible doesn't have much to say about this issue, with the exception of 1:16, 1 Cor 6:
1144	If only straights were allowed to get married and do whatever they want, wouldn't that mean that gays could get married and do whatever they want as well? Why can't they just marry
1145	One reason to not show movies on TV is just because so many more people agree with this side now.
1146	Because more people agree with this side now, it is more likely that the minority is right.

1148	Most people agree with the extension because many people do now.
1149	Just because so many more people agree with a side, that it has reached a consensus doesn't mean it is right. People are still being killed
1150	You cannot assume you are a great person if you do not have any good examples to follow. If you desire to see a world full of this goodness, you must realize you are an example that others will watch. You have to be that spark that starts the fire.
1151	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people.

If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
1155	Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's because you have a greater need. But then again, I really don't know. If someone in your family is in need then you are going to do anything for that family member rather than a random person you don't know. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what, because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need but you're not related to that person, you are going to help the random person.
1156	Helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.

1158	To me, a personal pursuit is a better endeavour. Your personal pursuit should come first before any other's.

If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
1159	Personal pursuit comes first but if someone is in need and needs help then it's your duty to help them. However, helping someone is not a requirement. Your personal pursuits come first and everything else will follow from there.
1160	At the moment, I would have to choose a Pursuit that would advance my personal goals, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished first. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
1161	Before I can begin to help others, I must set goals and accomplish them. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
1162	The choice must be what is important to you. Choose a personal pursuit, you have goals set, and you would like to have them accomplished before you can help others. Although helping others is important and enjoyable, it is more important to focus on what is important to you.
1163	At the moment, I would have to choose a personal pursuit. I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
1164	At the moment, I would choose to become the sole owner of a restaurant where I would help others, it might be a restaurant I would buy and help others manage. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
1165	Considering that people can be pushed into final stages of illness by medical negligence or abuse, I believe that those who wish to die should be given access to effective medical aid to do so. But if there is no medical management and no psychiatric assessment or if there is only opposition to the request, then such individuals deserve the opportunity to be given a natural and dignified burial.
1166	People should be allowed to die with dignity. While there are obvious needs for safeguards and protocols to protect the innocent from predators, if someone is terminally ill and no longer considers their quality of life to be sufficient to continue, then they should be allowed to request medications to end their life. I have watched relatives die of cancer; no-one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
1167	I believe we should be able to die with dignity. Those who want to should get all the support they need, and those that choose to die should be given the means to do so.

Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.

I have watched relatives die of cancer; no-one deserves to be forced to go through that process unwillingly. Those that want to should get all the support they need; those that choose to die early should be given the means to do so.
1169	It shouldn't be given the means to do so, if they can be brought to awareness that the quality of life is low and they have no control over it.
1170	See my point. Hypocrisy is such a prevalent trait in both parties that you know exactly what kind of person they will choose when the time comes for a statewide ballot election. The only person you should consider before voting is the one who has in fact made specific decisions to uphold the values you believe in. Wether in office or not, they have to present a confident, solid, competent, and ethical stance when dealing with the issues you care about.
1171	Whenever there is a vote it should be all about the policy and not pay raises and what this person did during their absence from office. After all, we are all their bosses to some extent, and we put them in office. You know what irritates me the most is the wonderful pay raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put in the ballot, it's rather or not. It's their day to day jobs that worry us and so should be put on the ballot. After all, aren't we all their bosses to some extent? Also, if they decided they wanted a raise, they would be working for us, and we should understand their needs. However, it is all mudslinging and propaganda with everything being a hostile political environment to influence the voters.
1172	There are some in the military that are hypocrites, you know what I mean. Because sometimes they vote the way they think that you want to vote. For example, they are hypocrites because when they are elected, they get higher pay raises, when they are not elected they don't get high pay raises. What irritates me the most, is that they are given wonderful raise's themselves if something ought to be put on the ballot, it ought to be when they were in government you have to learn of those things before you vote for them and also learn their past. Of course, you also learn the things that you want them to do. For example you vote for Obama, you want him to do that, then learn the things that he has done as a politician to see if it is what you want them to do. For example, maybe he promised to give something up, than learn how he has fulfilled his promises that he made before the election.
1173	You should be able to select your legislators based on what their actual record is, not what they pretend they voted on when they were in office. This way you know if they are voting like you want them to on the issues that are important to you. A campaign is a bunch of propaganda, with mudslinging.
1174	In many states, there are changes that should be put on the ballot by the government. If we all voted for someone from the position where we can tell if they are voting the way we want them to, then we would know if this person was voting the way we want them to on the issues that are important to us. Where was their "absent record"? After all aren't we all their bosses? You know what irks me most? It is the wonderful raises they give themselves. If there is something that should be put on the ballot, it's rather or not they should have a pay raise. After all, where else can you go to work and decide gee I am giving myself a pay raise? However it's all a bunch of propaganda with mudslinging.
1175	On a personal note, don't do it. This is a controversial issue on the Internet and in some places you are acting illegally by linking to other websites. We suggest that you check to see if the owners of the websites you're linking to want you to do so. It's a question of honoring your word and trusting others as well. Again, in this situation check to see that your links will not have legal consequences. It's a question of keeping other people informed and truthful about your ideas.
1176	Although the internet is a relatively recent phenomenon, laws and policies are being created as we speak. But unless you are pretty sure they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well. There are 'banners' for other people to put on their websites. However, some people don't mind if you put the link. Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
1177	There will be no laws (except self-regulating limits) regarding privacy on the internet. So far, what little is happening in these forums, has simply been the result of wise people having the same philosophy about privacy as we have, and the ISPs having the same policies regarding unpaid visitors that we do.
1178	Because the internet is such a recent phenomenon laws and policies are being created as we speak. But unless you're pretty sure, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.  Many people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites and link back to them. But some people don't mind if you put the URL. Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it? It's just a matter of asking.
1179	If you haven't checked something out of your own choice, please don't post a link to it on your blog.  It's always possible that someone's going to use it to confront them with something they don't want to face.  My bet is that you would end up putting a link somewhere on your site to such information, and that someone else could use it against you as a defense.  I can't answer any legal questions about it because I have never had to consider this myself. Bottom line is that you would have to ask someone first.  Just a good general rule of thumb.
1180	If you were to bend sexual harrassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from your co-workers, you would get in trouble with the police.  I think that policies against sexual harrassment only apply in the workplace.
1181	Not only does sexual harassment occur inside the workplace, but after working hours.  As far as I know, sexual harassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the sexual harassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harrassment exist only for the workplace environment.  But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1182	No, unless a woman is harassed outside the workplace by a man who doesn’t have a job, it will not be considered sexual harrassment.  But, I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1183	Not if it happened outside the workplace and after working hours. As far as I know, sexual harassment only occurs when the person receiving the comment, approach, or inappropriate personal contact perceives it as insulting, demeaning, or threatening. Many people bend the sexual harassment rules in the workplace by hitting on or accepting remarks from their co-workers. I think that policies against sexual harassment exist only for the workplace environment (whichever this environment may be). But I believe that a person can get in trouble with the cops if he or she is accused of bothering another person in a sexual way.
1184	Any of these four situations leads to the situation being accused of sexual harrassment.
1185	Yes, I agree that it's more difficult to prove someone is guilty nowadays, so the question remains; Is it worse or better for society? The corollary of the above statement; Is it better for criminals to spend their entire lives in prison or do they just get out and start killing again?
1186	I agree with you that Dna is easily proof that someone is guilty. However, in cases where the suspect or a witness was tortured, then the DNA can be abused. When that's done, it is a burden on the tax payer and ultimately the law should be changed so that DNA is not considered a guilt inducing tool anymore.
1187	Ancient Romans believed that punishment should only be carried out if a crime or transgression was proven beyond all reasonable doubt. But now in modern times, it has become accepted practice to give even the slightest fact about a suspected offender, even in the case of crimes against children, for example.
1188	It may have prevented further people from killing, but it is still a burden on the tax payer supporting scum like that in prison.
1189	It may not prevent further people from killing, but at least it is less of a burden on the tax payer supporting the scum who commit such crimes.
1190	Personally I detest it. However, I find it necessary since our husband and I own our own electrical company that offers 24 hour service and we get a lot of calls on our cell phones at night since we have our land line forwarded to our cells. However, we always put our phones on silent/vibrate when we are in a public place that way we don't disturb anyone around us.

1195	Expansion of the drinking age in Mexico only solves the problem for the drug traffickers who profit from underage drinking. There are no positive reasons for a higher drinking age.
1196	You know why not? After all, people in Europe are allowed to drink at the age of 16-Germany---and in Mexico the drinking age was 18 until now that it's 21. I think the reason why it's 21 is because people in the United States are too freaking retarded and don't know how to act right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or any other problems? Think about that!
1197	In your own country, drinking at age sixteen is allowed, but in other countries, it's restricted at age eighteen. I think the reason why it's eighteen is because people in the US are too freaking retarded and don't know how to behave right. Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower, and they actually have fewer accidents or any other problems? Think about that!
1198	Why in foreign countries the drinking age is lower and they actually have less accidents or any other problems? Think about that!
1199	Why in foreign countries? Why shouldn't they make drinking age 18 there?
1200	To reduce the amount of drug addicts, I would like to see better treatment centers. Put them in jail for hurting people and families. However, if they are capable of getting better by themselves, there should be a plan to clean them up by fostering them and getting them jobs. To put in jail who hurt another person and his family is unfair and can stigmatize them.
1201	If we gave the drug addict better programs to clean them up and help them get jobs and then we don't have to pay for food and lodging for people who can get better. I think that there are better rehabilitation centers that a drug addict can attend that will make them even better prepared for society.
1202	In all my years as a nurse I can say that I have never seen a patient in a better place than after treatment in rehab. So why take the people who are hurting other people and jail them instead of taking care of them and educating them and helping them get a job and then they can support themselves and don't need state help? Why not send them to rehab instead?
1203	My point is that there should be better programs to clean them up and help them get jobs, instead of paying for food and lodging for people who can get better.
1204	Instead of creating more rehab centers I think that there should be better ones where people who are currently in prison, and are hurting other people, should get into those rehab programs, and help them with it. The people in those rehab centers should be people who hurt other people because they need to be treated and taught how not to use drugs, rather than doing rehab. Put the people who hurt other people in jail not the ones who just need help or aren't hurting anyone but themselves. Also, if the family finds out about the drug problem and the family doesn't do anything then they should get to pay for the drug addict's food and lodging until they get better, rather than taxpayers having to pay for their food and lodging. I think that the people who hurt people should go to rehab, rather than jail, but there should be better programs.

1205	Admission based on race can be legally used as one factor in a mixed case of all different considerations when applying for college or university. The decision was decided by the Supreme Court in the case that is known as the Bakke decision. The ruling stated that race cannot be used as the primary consideration in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process. Although it is illegal for any employer to admit based on quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life to many people.
1206	Because the ruling stated that race cannot be used as the primary factor in determining admissions, but can be used as part of the decision process. No company can admit to quotas in the job market, but diversity is the new way of life to many people.
1207	Although no company will ever admit to quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life to many people.
1208	Whether people admit to quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life to many people.
1209	Although no company will ever admit to quotas in the job market, it does exist. Diversity is the new way of life to many people.
1210	YES, you can get a ticket for blocking your driveway in Los Angeles County. It's actually against the law to block any driveway rather than your own or not. If you block a driveway, in an emergency, how will people park there? If you didn't leave the keys, the other thing is what if emergency personnel needed to get to your backyard, etc. It's even against the law to block a sidewalk.
1211	Yes, you can get a ticket for blocking your driveway in Los Angeles County. It's against the law to block any driveway rather than it's own or not. If you block a driveway and an emergency situation arises, how will the public park there get there car moved if you are gone. ADN YOU DID NOT LEAVE THE CAR KEYS, and another thing, is what if emergency personnel needed to get to your back yard and this is contrary to the law to block a sidewalk
1212	YES you can get a ticket for blocking your drive way in Los Angeles County, it's actually against the law to block any drive way rather it's your own or not, if you block a driveway and there is an emergency and the people would like to park there, how will the people park there if you are gone, ADN, you didn't leave your car keys the other thing, is what if an emergency personnel needed to get to your backyard, et cetera, it's even against the law to block a side walk
1213	Yes, you can get a ticket for blocking a driveway in Los Angeles County, it's actually against the law to block any driveway rather it is your own driveway or not, if you block a driveway without giving any notice in advance, an emergency arises, how will the population park there, and the police can't move the car out if you left the car keys, the other thing is what if emergency personnel needed to get to your backyard, what's the law there? Block a sidewalk too,"
1214	Yes, it is against the law to block any drive way. Rather it is your own, or not, if you block any driveway. If you block an emergency people could get there car moved. What if an emergency person needed to get to your backyard, etc. It is also against the law to block a sidewalk.
1215	I think black people shouldn't say n because it still is a word that divides races. If two black kids are hanging out with a white kid and they call each other the n word the white kid just wanting to be friendly is going to want to say the word too because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other. But on the other hand i am one of the few african americans who feel this way. And i do agree why does it really matter so much to white americans. Okay you can't have this one word you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing.
1216	Why should black people say that either. They still have the word "black". If 2 black kids are hanging out with a white kid, and they call each other the n-word, the white kid just wanted to be friendly, is that going to want to say it too because he will always feel like an outsider, if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other. But on the other hand, I am one of the few African American, who feels this way, and I do agree why does it really matter so much to white Americans. Why can't they have this one word and make it there is all the other words to use, is it really so horrible that they have this one thing?
1217	Black people shouldn't say the n-word because it still is a divisive term that divides races. If two black children are hanging out with a white child and they call each other the n-word, the white child who just wanted to be friendly will want to say the word too because he will always feel like an outsider if he can't great them in the friendly manner they great each other.

Okay you can't have this one word you have all the other words to use plus you run the world, is it really so horrible that black people have this one thing.
1219	The reason why Black people shouldn't say the word is because Black people and White people from different countries should not assume that they are in the same race because every person is unique and should never be judged on the basis of race.
1220	This debate has clearly clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural marriages, they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.

1224	But sometimes I hear it mentioned as something to be proud of. I think there is something interesting to be said, though. I think something might be interesting in the next argument. I think it would be odd if men only. No men are alone, are they, so that too would seem odd. If we take that as a starting point, we must then separate married from divorced. There is no way of saying that everyone who has been divorced is less than someone married. It doesn,t matter what anybody does before the wedding, afterward, and before the divorce. Everyone in the world does it. All in the world have lied to one another. Everybody has abused one another. Every relationship, whether married or otherwise, has its share of problems. Some are serious enough that we label them problems and cast them aside. Others are cut and dried little issues that do not matter at all.  A degree of slovenliness is surely found in all relationships. You probably have been in a marriage where one person got up and the other asked him to stay up. You were never done. Something went off in the bedtime rituals and it turned into an emotional battle. At one point or another every married person has been troubled by some bizarre subject. Some are great fights and they are the results of any kind of relationship. Others are just conflicts which keep being filled in with every bit of
1225	There is a difference between saying "You shall not kill" and saying "You shall not commit murder." The first says that you must respect the life of all beings, while the second says you must respect the life of all innocent beings.
1226	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news and find as much info as you want, which a book couldn't possibly do. This is not true. Books can give you lots of good info as well as making you think and help you find things you can never find on TV.
1227	The Bible doesn't say "Thou shall not kill", it says "Thou shall not commit murder".  There is a difference.
1228	It blows my mind how people can be anti-capital punishment and pro-abortion. Either respect all life, or respect all innocent life, but not the liberal "don't kill convicted murderers, but kill all the babies you want". BTW - to the person below... the Bible does NOT say "thou shall not kill" it says "thou shalt not commit murder". There is a difference
1229	Don't support capital punishment for convicted murderers, but support capital punishment for babies and embryos.
1230	To think that anyone should have the right to have children is being selfish. Think about the children?..I wouldn't want a mom who's mentally ill..or a dad who's in a wheelchair..think about it...So my answer is no..Give the kids a home where they have a mom who can bake cookies for them and a dad who can go out back and play baseball with them.
1231	Everybody did not have the right to have children.
1232	Everyone had the right to have children. It's unfortunate that some people chose the wrong path.
1233	I'm in complete agreement that if a family wants to have children, they should have that right. My opinion is that there are more people than children in this world. So what if a mom can't afford to keep them? What if a dad is disabled and can't afford to take care of them? How does one protect the rights of the children or the parents when the rules are based on the birth order of each child? I think that people should be given the chance to have what they really want.
1234	I think those kinds of people that have children are just being selfish and are thinking about themselves. I mean think about the children? I wouldn't want to have a mom who goes through mental illness and a dad who is in a wheelchair, think about it! So my answer is no, I don't believe everyone had the right to have children.
1235	If you live in California, you would be able to have your vehicle forfeited to the state by simply going to the courts and informing them of your suspended license.  Thats a crime in its own right.  If that was the case, there would be a lot less vehicular crimes committed, including vehicular accidents.
1236	In the US, pulling a plate off a van is an inexcusable act that should be punished. Here's how to bring your van in to forfeit and avoid the 30-day suspension
1237	Seriously though...if you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm.  Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Someone like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  People like you are involved in an exponentially higher than average number of traffic accidents so the legislature figured maybe people like you should have your vehicles forfeited to the state if you just didn't go along with the game plan.  From the safe drinkers brief on the repeal of Proposition 28:  Voting for Proposition 28 will allow the California Legislature to pass a law to be called Proposition 26, which will repeal the proposed increase in the minimum drinking age to 21 years in the state.  The Safe Drinkers Code will enshrine in law the elimination of all public intoxication.  Proposition 28 was submitted by the ballot initiative team titled "Statewide Reformatory Act and Amendment to Driver's License and MDM 210 - Prohibition against Public Intoxication in Riverside, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino Counties" and had the November 2005 election code as the date for it to be put to the vote.  The link to the legislative package of Proposition 28 is below:  | SHAFE DRINKERS BRief NOVEMBER 2005 | Sfdr T1275-h05-4921-001 | fbs_1275_v2.pdf  |D'aquesta forma, el probinçatge de l'esmentada llei, que propugna que siguin sempre atorgades llicències d’emissor un cop superades una serie d'exàmens, serà substituït per un sistema continu que garantirà que l”autonomia dels centres transmissors no serà mai envaïda per un cheque en blanc del Consell i que l’entrega de la llicència per al seu emissor per part d’Education Nationale queda garantit d’una manera
1238	Assuming that someone is towing your vehicle and impounding it for 30 days for such behaviour isn't going to stop you. If you are in California, you bet the police can forfeit your vehicle and it doesn't take three times to make it a charm. Technically, your vehicle could be subject to forfeiture proceedings after your first suspended license beef.  Something like you is exactly the reason the legislature designed that law, because your privilege to drive has been taken away from you and yet you obviously continue to drive.  Pardon my shortsightedness, but driving is one of the most important privileges in human history, and yet you really need to stop driving.  Really.
1239	Are you seriously kidding me? What is the point of being some dummy with a car?  You need to take that license away.
1240	If the 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was a case of incest, or that their health would not tolerate it? I would expect more people to support infanticide or it's many variations but fewer would want to support murder.
1241	If the other 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was a case of incest, or that their health would not tolerate it?" It would also mean that breastfeeding would be stopped, the majority of women being breastfeeding for reasons of survival, rather than love, and it would mean more people like me would have to vote for certain men.  We need to give women the right to their personal health decisions. With birth control being such an important part of life, we need to protect it. We should have safe birth control, we should take care of our bodies as they come to us.
1242	If the other 97% were banned, wouldn't those women start saying that they were raped, it was a case of incest, or that their health would not tolerate it? I agree that cutting down on abortions in the US would be good. Birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
1243	Assuming that the request by the other 97% have been satisfied by the new law and that all the women want to carry the child to term there will be more censorship in the media, and more women will be weaned on to the birth control pill.
1244	As I'm sure you know, if the other 97% were banned, women would start saying they were raped, it was incest, or that their health would not tolerate it? Most of these cases would be dismissed as "that looks like a natural event" or "the rights of the child". And I feel like that would improve the quality of life for both parents, and would be very unlikely to cause the wide spread slander and conspiracy theory that it would be.  Birth control should be administered to anyone having sex.
1245	It would be little different from owning a block of land. Most or all islands are either the responsibility of a near country or are called a protectorate of a country so even though you owned that "island block" you could not do as you wished. Though there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has but remember who is going to police them.

1247	Even though an island block is possibly under the law of a near country you could still do as you wish within reason. This is the advantage of owning an island. There is a chance you could have local laws such as a town with a council but remember that the council is only to be trusted to do what they think is good for the people of the town.
1248	You would be little different from owning a block of land, most islands are either the responsibility of a near country, or are called a protectorate of a country so even though you owned that "island block" you could not do as you wish. You could not have local laws such as a town has. But there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has but remember who is going to police them.
1249	It would be very little different from owning a block of land that is mostly or all an island is either the responsibility of a close country or is called a protectorate of a country so even though you owned that "block of island" you could not do as you wished. Though there is a chance you could have local laws such as a town has, but remember who is going to police them.
1250	White Anglo-Saxon Protestants if systematically beaten down in their social and economic lives. Consequently, they pretty much match the criminal profile.
1251	If white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, they'd pretty much match the criminal profile.
1252	If white anglo-saxon protestant suffer so much discrimination in their daily lives that they are pressured and preached that it's a threat to their way of life, then people will then go more easily to criminal behaviour. That way, they are not punished for their bad behaviour, they will be taught how to commit crime instead.  The justice system is the best, but often does not work when it is used to punish a crime that simply did not exist. When we are not good at seeing some injustice being perpetrated by a wrong system, then we should not try to prevent anyone from committing crime. The biggest crime is not necessarily a murder and not necessarily a rapist. It is the absence of justice, which is a crime against humanity. I see the injustice and I call for legislation to prevent people from committing acts of violence.
1253	If White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASP) were systematically beaten down for generations, then they would pretty much match the criminal profile.
1254	Yes, if white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are systematically beaten down for generations, they would pretty much match the criminal profile.

1260	Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a f****** seat! Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat?  And what the hell is a "senior discount" about? I hear the same old old excuse that seniors are on "fixed income".  What does *that* mean? Aren't we *all* on "fixed income"? My income doesn't vary. In fact, younger people probably have more expenses than older people, with the exception of prescription drugs.  And what is this "kids eat free" b.s.? Why can't I eat free? I mean, Geez, the kids aren't paying for anything. Let me eat every 5th meal free and I guarantee I'll come back to your restaurant.  :-)  p.s. for those who misunderstood the question, Jr. isn't in jail. He was "charged" an adult *rate*, not charged with a crime.

1262	Yes, it is. I've always been bothered by pricing based on age. Take movies, for example. A seat is a f**king seat! Why should people between the ages of 12 and 64 pay more for the same seat?

1263	I'm not saying that kids eat free. I'm saying that the kids who eat free are kids who are my customers.
1264	Yes, it's true that if you are between 12 and 65 and are allowed to borrow money that you will have more than you have now but not money that goes out the door without getting something for it. If you are working, I mean, then there is no reason to have an extra $5 bill on you just in case!
1265	First of all, a ban on marijuana would be very expensive for the government since it would have to invest a lot of money in taking it away from people. Then, police will spend a lot of time taking people into custody for crimes related to the drug. Finally, the government would only make a little to no profit with the ban and would have to spend a lot of money from taxing people who consume.
1266	We agree that smoking pot should be legalized and the government should lose all of the tax revenue they currently make from it. The government could also create job's for the government's employees in order to direct them back to society instead of incarcerating them. As for the government spending tax money, there is no way the government would try to ban it. The government would only try to prevent illegal usage. Any tobacco sales are taxed by the government by forcing tax breaks on the companies. Therefore, any taxed tobacco sellers would also have to make money back in order to pay their taxes. On the other hand, marijuana sales are not taxed, therefore all pot sellers would have to take it to another form of business. As a result, it would not be as profitable for the government to take a more drastic stance towards marijuana. On the other hand, the government would focus more on illegal uses of tobacco and alcohol which should be banned completely, as the government wants the majority of the tax money they make from it to actually being placed in the pockets of the people. Any illegal usage of any other drugs would be taken as a joke and the government would not spend the tax money trying to prevent it.
1267	Yeah I agree. I don't smoke marijuana but think it should be legalized. Think of how much money the government would save/make. It makes more sense to tax people who drive recklessly and have no insurance. The government spends lots of money on promoting anti-smoking. They also spend huge amounts of tax dollars building new prisons because a lot of people get arrested for possession. The government could tax it similar to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make Millions maybe even more. Police could spend time actually helping people rather than trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then. They could create new jobs and stimulate the economy with people buying and selling.
1268	I'm fully in favor of recreational use of marijuana. Not only is it legal but it's also okay for the use of your own body and medical uses.
1269	I agree. I don't smoke marijuana but think it should be legalized. Think of how much money the government would save/make 1 The government spends loads of money to try and prevent people from using marijuana. With advertisements and all. 2 The government has to spend tax money to build new prison's, because so many people get arrested for possession. 3 Government could tax it similar to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make Millions maybe even more. 4 Police could spend time actually helping people rather than trying to bust people for smoking a little marijuana every now and then. 5 Could create new jobs and stimulate the economy with people buying and selling.
1270	To confront a woman who is trying to harm other people, you need to leave your anger and spite out of the situation.  Remember that you must still respect her.  If you anonymously show her the facts, it shows that you will not join her fellow employees in the sting operation, and perhaps you will even get a promotion.
1271	If you face an all-out war and you show indisputable proof, then he will have to act.
1272	There is an old adage: "Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you openly confront this woman, you are facing an all-out war, she will despise you for having exposed her misdeeds. If you anonymously send the General Manager proof of her actions, he may be inclined not to believe the accusations. You could have a meeting with the General Manager, and ask for anonymity, but you must have all your facts completely established. Getting people to write their opinion will not be accepted as fact. You need absolute proof, and to show her intent to cheat and lie. She can always claim these were innocent mistakes or things done without her knowledge. Remember, you will need verifiable dates, names, events, and most importantly, a consistent story from each person who was a witness to any of these events. You do not want to come across as a whining malcontent. If you show indisputable proof, the General Manager will have to act.
1273	To expose a cheating behavior, you must confront this woman directly.  If she hates it, she will definitely despise you.  If she is just aroused, she may be inclined not to believe the accusations. You can show your desperation with the threat of social media, or through meetings with the Management. It must be absolutely clear all facts were established. Getting people to write their opinions will be unbelievable. Also, you need proof as consisiting date, names, events and most importantly a Consistent story from each person who was a witness to the event. Don't come across as a whining malcontent. Just make it unbelievable that it's a standard behavior to take photos or videos of sex and use them later. Remember, it must be verifiable that dates, names and event were consistent and that you know them because they happened. Don't assume that everyone is upset about the cheating behavior. Be at all times bold, and you will find a way that proves her cheating.
1274	We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession!
1275	Although Tanzania has lots of potential, if you ask me my opinion as an outsider, if Tanzania can develop into an exemplary country, my response would Yes, but there is long way to go and a lot to change before that.
1276	Dar has many opportunities but if you asked my opinion, I think there is a lot to change before the country can develop into an exemplary country.
1277	One thing that I noticed is that Dar is not enthusiastic in whatever they are doing and have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is a general feeling of detachment in the Dar people and hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing. This country can certainly develop into an exemplary country, but there is a long way to go and a lot to change.
1278	There is general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is hardly any enthusiasm in whatever they are doing. There is great amount of tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to accomplish.
1279	Dar, as a country, has great potential. But if you ask me my opinion as an outsider if Dar can develop into an exemplary country, my response would Yes, but there is long way to go and a lot to change before that.
1280	In the name of'I don't like that party ', people will side with him as well. So he could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him because they are so much dislike the opposing political party.
1281	I'm often asked a question.   The sheep stand behind the administration because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing its supporters with fear. They use the sticker on the crayon chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 affect how they live.   In the name of'I'm not a fan of that party', people will side with the administration too.   So Bush could have told his supporters that he is the spawn of Satan and people would still have voted for him as they so much dislike the opposition party.
1282	The sheep stand behind Bush because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. Public servants.
1283	When I look at the chart and read the statistics I think that how it is reported is somewhat misleading.   In the name of 'I don't like that party' people will side with him as well. So Bush could have told people that he is the spawn of Satan and people would have still voted for him because they so much dislike the opposing political party.

1285	People have the right to do whatever they want to do. Yeah, maybe it sucks that there are so big consequences to it, but really you sound stupid! Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsibility and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl were thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more people are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
1286	Sex is not an evil thing. You should talk to your kids about responsibility and how they can choose to respect your boundaries. Jails are overcrowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of that. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discouage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
1287	It is our right to decide whether sex is good or bad, and we don't have to be taught how to do it. We should know it already from when we were younger. The more we discourage sex, the more people want to do it. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl are thrown into jail because of sex. You can't stop nobody from doing what they want to do. You should know that already from when you where younger. The more you discourage it the more they are going to want to do it. People have that right. Yes, even kids. That's the only way they learn.
1288	Sex should not be taught as an evil thing because sex is an important and should be taught in schools. Jail is over crowded because of sex and not because of drunken driving or anything else. People should be able to make their own decisions in life. Yes, people are free to make their own decisions in life. Maybe this is something that sucks because people can be punished severely for the terrible things that they do. But you should know that it's not for real. Jails are over crowded because people are punished for horrible things. People cannot be punished too severely for something that is only in their mind. The more you discourage sex the more ppl want to have sex. Sex is normal. Jails are over crowded because of that. Imagine what it would be like if ppl were not punished severely and he was the one that throws them in jail because they was having sex. Jails are over crowded now. Imagine what it would be like if ppl were to go in jail for something that is only in their mind.
1289	Discussing sex is never evil. The more you discourage sex the more people are going to want to be adults and live a responsible and private life. It's a personal choice between the person and their partner. It's not teachable. The only teachable thing is responsibility and knowing when it is appropriate for you to have a child. If you don't know when, your partner can always come to you and inform you, if he really cares for you.
1290	This situation has nothing to do with a lease...it's your business if you give the key to your apartment to someone, especially if you provide them with the reason you stated. No extra person is staying there, it's not a sublet, you're doing nothing wrong...Sounds to me like your landlord is way too nosey, you are most def within your rights.
1291	To me sounds like your landlord is way too nosey. You are most definitely within your rights.
1292	You are most definitely within your rights if you give a key to someone, specifically in your case, to get rid of a particularly nosey landlord.
1293	It is no one's business whether someone gives a key to another person, and this case is no different. It's most likely just a misunderstanding.
1294	Your landlord is too nosey, you are within your rights.  Maybe you should look into letting someone who you trust in there and then reporting the theft to them?
1295	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. Your part right on it never being used in a violent crime. I'm not sure where it happened, but so far only one person in the United States has been killed by a.50 caliber weapon and I believe it was a.50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. When California passed the law Barrett ended the warranties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so CA made an exception for.50cal black powder rifles!(which are easier to get by criminals)
1296	Your portion right on it. Never being used in a violent crime. I'm not sure where it happened but, so far only one person in the united states has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and I believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that is not stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. When California passed the law Barrett actually ended the warranties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal.416 rifle.

1298	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. Your point on it never being used in a violent crime is correct. I do not know where that one incident took place but so far only one person in the united states has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and i believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal.

Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so CA made an exception for.50cal blackpowder rifles! (which are easier to get by criminals)
1299	California passed a law so that the LAPD could be prevented from purchasing Barrett rifles because black powder rifles are easier for criminals. Barrett is actually an illegal rifle and as such the lawsuit against Barrett forced California to give special consideration to black powder rifles. Black powder rifles are usually around fifty cents less expensive to acquire than the very expensive Barrett rifles.
1300	Yes you do have officers that are racist, it's sad that you can't even trust the people out there that are supposed to protect you. But if you think about it, everyone is racist in their own little way. Some just don't even notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like crayons... They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still have to live in the same box.

1305	If you want to ask for forgiveness of God through Jesus Christ, then be a Christian not a Catholic because a catholic's sins are forgiven through the pope or father of the Catholic Church.

1310	The United States and the United Kingdom are among the most prosperous nations in the world, making them attractive targets for terrorists.  Additionally, because they have been steadfast in the Global War on Terror, they are more likely to be attacked for maintaining that position, and terrorists are more likely to try to scare citizens of those countries.  Therefore, the US and the UK have been more aggressive than most other nations in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries.
1311	Those who oppose antiterror laws (and who are terrorists in their own right), lack concern for the individual rights of the people. Therefore, the US and the UK are more aggressive in monitoring potential terrorist activities in other countries, but not everyone sees this as appropriate.

1315	We have freedom of speech and expression and all that crap. If you think freedom of speech is crap, then maybe you should move.
1316	If you don't like the idea of burning the flag, but the freedom it's supposed to represent, should allow someone to do so if they  want to. After all, what is being destroyed is only a piece of cloth. Making a law which prohibits us from burning the flag does much more damage than the act itself. You lose so much more by taking away people's freedom.
1317	If you think freedom of speech is crap, then maybe you're the one who needs to move.
1318	Free speech protects our rights. If you don't like it then maybe you shouldn't have used it. The freedom it gives can be used to harm or destroy other people.

1320	In the case of the Vietnam War we didn't get pulled out, and the Bay of Pigs was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry.  So it has nothing to do with it. And the world has been talking about the U.N. since President Eisenhower pulled out of it.
1321	If that happens to happen then the US will pull all their funding and troops that they have under their control.  Without the US support there is no UN organization that there to maintain peace and order in the world and so they can try.  I am sure that it was the Government that made the mistakes but I am also sure that they know about it, the thing is that the UN is an agency of the states and it is a fact that states do not love to be criticized by a certain group and that isn't a fault of the UN organization, it is a fault of the states.  We don't have anything to be ashamed of and I would love to get rid of that organization because it has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money.  We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have but the Bay of Pigs but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry and that's
1322	What if this happens? Then we'll pull our funding and we won't have any troops under their Paki control. Without US support, there is no UN. So they can try. I would really love to get rid of that organization for all the bad, useless and deceiving it has done in the past. We haven't done anything we shouldn't have anyway. Well the Bay of Pigs was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry.
1323	if they tried to starve the US, I would appreciate it if they would get rid of the UN. I would love to get rid of that organization, it has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. When we haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway.  Well the Bay of Pigs but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry
1324	If that happens the US will pull all our funding and troops from UN peacekeeping force. Without US support there is NO UN, so they can try it. I would love to get rid of that organization it has done nothing but steal, bad mouth the US and Israel, and waste our money. We haven't done anything that we shouldn't have anyway. Well the Bay of Pigs but that was Kennedy leaving the Cubans out to dry
1325	The Freedom of association is among other things, protects the individual's freedom to associate with whom he chooses. As far as I'm concerned, if two men want to free associate, they can do so as much as they like. But if they want to marry another man, that's the day I leave the US. Nobody's gonna force me to be gay.
1326	The first amendment, among other things, protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses. I willingly allow my desire to marry another man to exist if both of us choose to share our life in that union. I do not think that under this law, nobody is forced to get gay married.
1327	The first amendment, among other things, protects the individual's freedom to associate with whomever he chooses.

1330	Well, I think eventually it is just going to be a gimmick. Why would the large supermarket chains want to pay more for coffee beans, and when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods, and when we are all brainwashed on the money making carbon footprint idea, how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor.  I don't think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic even though it is riddled with genetically modified products.

1332	Once again it's easy to read through these labels. It's just about supporting a good farmer.
1333	Although Fairtrade and organic are riddled with GM foods, the social elite (in the sense of the U.S. government) will not go without them. Because in the eyes of this class, social justice is not an obligation. Instead, the class-interest and self-interest are what are just about all. They see no reason not to shoot first and ask questions later. This also shows the kind of double standards that are only reserved for the less than elite part of the population, for the basic standards of morals and accountability.

I don't think that the social elite will go without fair trade or organic even though it is riddled with GM, due to snobbery.
1335	(pause here for a deep bitter laugh).....What an excellent question! Let's see, this is a poor woman? A new immigrant? A middle class white woman? A woman whose family is not torn to shreds over an agonizing decision about which they don't agree? This is not an election year? The shrub is in enough hot water with the public without having this case become a major item in the same clogging halls that covered Schiavo's case? In any case, I agree completely that the "culture of life" supporters are a bunch of politically motivated hypocrites, but I find that I am a little grateful that this woman was permitted to die without going through the storm of public controversy that was played out between people who don't even know her.Cold comfort, but it's all I have some days. I am grateful that this woman had family with her and shame that compassion moved no one to wait for her mother.
1336	My vote is for the woman, but her death would have been a massively neglected scandal, and perhaps an act of mercy by her doctors.
1337	Do you, on the other hand, find it fair that a legitimate human life be quiescently taken at birth by using the phrases "Culture of Life," "freedom from unwanted pregnancy," "choosing the life", or "stealth"? Or that her tax dollars be used to plead for her life, or that she be paid the wages of a convicted felon? All of these terms have been used to justify abortion as long as I can remember...and they are all repellent and disgusting...and yet there are who believe that is okay? Why? Because it's agreed upon by most? What right or basis is there to do so? By the way, none of this applies if the life at stake was actually aborted at birth...But we couldn't be sure if that was the case, after all, she had an abortion and still didn't die. If it wasn't a sound abortion, why wouldn't the child be saved?
1338	(pause here for a bitter laugh)...What an excellent question! The culture of life party wants to make abortion as acceptable as it can be, just as they are making the process seem easier. The rights of the woman aren't who you blame. After all, it's not as if a woman couldn't come to a time in her life where she didn't want to get pregnant. Maybe she and her partner were searching for a way to expand their family. I'm sure there are many a woman in the past who's not proud of her abortion and now regret it. Maybe she discovered she was infected with HIV or her life would be in danger. Maybe she got pregnant out of desperation and not because she was planning to get the abortion.
1339	In the culture of life, when people support the right to abortion, and cannot bear to wait for the mother, they at least can agree to euthanize the mother. Such is good, human decency. But killing pregnant people really is wrong. It is not our business to decide when babies are aborted.
1340	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson release an album of songs that he never wanted to be released. Similarly, Tolkien's translation of Beowulf has just been published despite his protestations that it is "hardly to my liking". Jackie Kennedy's private letters to a priest are even being auctioned off. I believe that this kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur. If they are unfortunately published, you and I ought not to listen to or read these works. In short, I believe the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest. Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.

1345	Almost all problems seen today (and throughout history) with corruption in government is that we allow them to be bought with their own personal desires and selfishness. If we don't allow them to have the possibility of wealth, then we can put a stop to a lot of corruption. If a rich businessman gets into politics, he should give up all money and all other non-essential things. This will prove he isn't in it for the money, but for the actual job. I know chances of this being implemented are slim. Don't use that as an argument.

1350	my family was involved and to an extent is still involved with the troubles in Northern Ireland. While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them. It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland and them wanting to be part of Northern Ireland was blantantly false. The Republic of Ireland has more or less existed since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers. I also think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason.
1351	Although the IRA were blown up and people should be tried for offences, I don't think that the IRA should be disavowed by the government. Those in the IRA were people who loved their home as much as anyone else and I think that they should not be blamed for the troubles that have happened in Northern Ireland. There is also a black history, in Northern Ireland, that goes back many hundreds of years and which has been entirely different to the democratic rights that have come to the country. All of this would deserve to be remembered and to be researched and new generations should take advantage of these opportunities. I don't believe that we should be ashamed of the troubles in Northern Ireland, because that in itself would be a crime against the British heritage, which we all share.

1353	My family is involved in Northern Ireland troubles, and it has been an uncomfortable topic for me to address. My family has direct links to the IRA and its supporters, but I have not been told explicitly that they are evil people. My family is involved in the IRA and its supporters, and they are evil people and their behaviour is an attempt to destroy the UK.
1354	However, I think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and thus guilty of treason.
1355	Incumbents have the advantage of being able to grant political favors immediately, better financing, gerrymandering, and name recognition. Challengers need a boost to make it fair. This would cause higher turnover, which would be good because:  * It would reduce the corrupting influence of non quid pro quo contributions by making it more uncertain how long the purchased influence would last  * High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists  * When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good  I'm not sure what the best way to implement it is, but maybe just decrease incumbent's vote tally by 15% or so. My view is that something like this *should* be done, not that it's likely under present circumstances.
1356	If an incumbent has the good fortune to win reelection, he or she is more likely to be reelected given this system because the incumbent's advantages - more favorable financing, more support from the established major parties and no facing a challenger - will make it easier for them to win. I would say that it would be unwise to make such a change though; the incumbents' current gains are unquestionably problematic, and it would be good to incorporate some mechanism for the challenged's to receive some advantage in terms of the campaign costs. The partisan winner will undoubtedly enjoy some advantages in terms of funding, as will the incumbents who are in office by fiat. It would be difficult to cause even mild shift in the balance of power between the parties since the costs to the losing parties are so small.

1360	I'll start off with saying that I am a male myself and I consider myself an egalitarian, a humanitarian and a socialist. I don't like the feminist movement because from what I have personally seen from their views, they are simply female supremacists, however, from what I have seen, MRAs are the same as them.  I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, females being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it.  However, that's just my view. Feel free to change it!

However, that's just my view. Feel free to change the sentence that I had written to suit your tastes.
1363	I've heard several men say, "I want equality in the workplace and in society." I want to agree with them on the equality part, but I think they are jumping to conclusion here since it really is the same thing. A man can be as feminist as he wants to be, but the term feminist should not be used to imply anything other than the basic equality of men and women, and that's a dangerous move IMO. Not that I personally do any specific gender discrimination (not that I do, it would not be right) but the general perception that I'm a feminist to think so is quite wrong since it equates me to a feminist movement. When it comes to feminism it's not up to me nor is it your job to tell me or anyone else how to live my life but it's a goal, or a utopia to have equal rights. When I disagree with certain men it seems to mean that I actually have a value or higher position in society than women, while I'm not so sure if that is the case.  That's all I'm saying. Don't jump to conclusions because it's getting you nowhere good, ignore the words no matter what they say and just think about the feeling that's behind it.

1365	I think misinformed voting is a problem. The test could be a way of decreasing the number of misinformed votes. The bill would be laid out for voters to read. The test could be done in the manner that just as in e-voting, a representative of the government would present the bill that the voter was voting on to them. This would be called a 'open book' test because the voters would literally have access to the bill.
1366	Misinformed voting is a problem. I think that introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important. The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.   -EDIT 1.0-  I believe this is necessary as people with limited education tend to be those most likely to vote by proxy or in the mail. Even if one successfully intimidated someone into voting in person, one might still be able to call another voter and persuade them to vote for the candidate of their choice, especially if the problems with the voting system are not made clear. I believe that in such cases, our government could use this practice to create incentive to learn of the problems with voting methods that are currently available.
1367	Introducing a way to cut down on the amount of misinformed votes is important, and I think that the test would have to be 'open book' like the way the test of comprehension is done. The test would have to assess not only if the voter has read the bill, but if they are actually able to understand the truth. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill.

1370	If you're going to waste an unnecessary amount of time on sound systems then go out and rent or go out to a cafe or restaurant and enjoy it with people rather than your family. My personal opinion is that an audio system should never be considered street legal. I would decline any inspection from the DMV for this reason.
1371	You know these cars with "systems." The sound is a clear distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren, or passing car horn. From a quality of life standpoint, it's pure noise pollution, and a sign of pure inconsideration when a driver refuses to keep it down late at night. I feel that the DMV should be performing a decibel check on all car audio systems, and that they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal. Reject their inspection, and impound them if discovered on the road.
1372	Car audio systems, speakers, and stereos should not exceed the maximum sound output of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal. With safety and quality of life being the main reasons for not allowing loud car audio systems, I feel that the driving test should be incorporated to verify that the car's audio system does not exceed the maximum sound output of the car's horn. Reject their inspection and impound them if found on the road.

We will never replace real medicine and they are our customers. Take care also! I know you said it was ok not to like this stuff but you are also saying it is not ok to say something like, "You should be taking this product or living this way and not the other way." I cannot use the people i know to say my body and my beliefs to everyone else because not everyone is interested in, nor understands, nor accepts what the evidence says. Sure they are free to think whatever they want, but you are going to know for a fact that it is not OK for you to tell someone that they cannot have all the same rights or freedoms that other people do, because you are simply not willing to listen to the facts. Saying that to anyone is abuse and persecution. Stop, that is not how it should work. Here is an example of why I do not respect your religious beliefs about issues that are important to you. You are closing your mind to facts about what someone else says. "That is just stupid, that is stupid, that is stupid." "What is he saying? What are the facts? How can someone say that? This should never happen." "Maybe it is not important to me, I am not going to bother about what someone says." Yet you are free to say things like, "go buy a gun. It is probably one of the safest things you could do, especially if it was accurate." I have you on a day and time that I can not come with evidence because I do not have an answer or answer to your objections. What better reason do I have to go hide and suck up to someone? If you were a proponent of this would you tell me to buy this product or see this doctor? Sure sure you would
1376	I understand that religion can be good because it teaches good morals, encourages people to help others, etc. I also understand that many conflicts have started because of religion or have revolved around religion, for example WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another reason I think this is because of how other religions try to demonize one another. "Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!" There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on "faith", religious places (whether it be a church or temple whatever) are always asking for money, censorship of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc. Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion. Suicide bombers Suppression of logical thought You get the point. So reddit, CMV
1377	In regards to other religions, you can see them in conflict over almost everything.  For example, think about all the wars started because of religion, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, the Western & Indian/Malay Ocean, China-Europe, Mughal India, Carthage, Persia, Israel-Palestine, the 19th century Holocaust, the American War of Independence, the current conflicts between India & Pakistan, the political revolts against the royalty, the different strict and non strict rules & laws and the continuing conflicts between two nations can be attributed to religion and it takes a lot to get people to stop fighting.            NOT to mention people are often elected to office because of their religion. The supreme court of the United States  was founded because of the religious disagreements.  Religious people desire that we see this as a national holiday to show respect to their religious beliefs.  Not to mention, social media,  censorship,  suppression of logical thought, and religions wish to make us believe what they want to believe so that they keep us blind to the real world.  Religion will always cause conflict.  Censorship seems to come up in almost all religions of all cultures and not all of them want it.  We only should censor things that harm us or put us in danger.  The state has a right to censor anything to protect its citizens.    There are several countries where the government is at war with its population.  It's because of the religion or country's history or government oppression or both.   Also, consider countries that go to war as soon as they hear about a nuclear war.  Even if there aren't any people that die.  Even if the impact is small.  Because of their religion.  A group who is fanatical will wreak havoc in an effort to destroy the masses.      I do not understand how sex is sin.  If you are going to do it, then do it but if you don't you are living a moral
1378	Only people who speak only from the heart can make an actual change to the world. You can only do that if you have a strong moral system behind what you are saying and do not compromise on it. Also, let us not downplay the importance of politics and the governments role.
1379	You are right.  We should be turning to science and logic. There are a few religions, which try to demonize or suppress others. There are many conflicts that have been fueled by religion like WwII. Many muslims have invaded various other countries and left people in their homeland struggling to survive. The Ottomans ruled almost a third of Europe during the 1300's and 1500's, and they gave themselves the title Great Satan in the name of Islam, to rile up the population. There was also the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the disputed region of Palestine which took place between 1948 and 1967.  But of course there are a lot more conflicts with religion just as long as there is no approach to truth. But I think that many of these conflicts started because of religion itself, not religion being apathetic to them. Religion brings about so much ignorance and hate. For example anyone can go to Google and type in "killing people". They will find sites that offer advice on murdering, such as "Trimlinfo.org", but they won't find those sites if you type it into Google on a Religion website. That is because some Muslims might say that killing Jews is bad, but there would be no problem about it if it were suggested or even just implied. This starts problems. Religious groups are like camps. Anyone who has an opposing view to the group's doctrine is found lacking and is eliminated. This even happens within religions. I remember going to Sunday School when I was a kid.  The kids that were orthodox were voted less than valuable and therefore were kept in a separate class.  That started the idea of quotas by which the group was forced. This is bad, because it starts lies and misconceptions. The most egregious example was the Holocaust. A lot of people believe that because so many Jews were murdered during WwII (also believe that since it started in the 20th century all Jews will be killed some day), that all Jews are
1380	To clarify, I do not believe the world\'s climate is static and unchanged, I just do not think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone.   Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling.
1381	We don't know for sure if global warming is happening. Many scientists dispute the claim that global warming has caused harm to people or planet. For my part, I'm skeptical and cannot accept the idea that there's some kind of scientific consensus on this subject and have my doubts on global warming. I've known some people who are moving to colder climes and they have no idea what they are getting into.

1385	Every new development in sickness prevention or life elongation contributes to the steady and inevitable increase in people on this earth. The bottom line is that people will increasingly die at a smaller rate while new people are increasingly born at a greater rate. The earth cannot sustain this.  Is there another point of view that would help me enjoy these medical discoveries more? All I see is a bleak future fast approaching as more people live longer.
1386	Yeah, the discovery of the malaria vaccine will decrease the suffering, eradicate the disease, and increase the number of people on the planet, but it also will increase population.

1388	In point of view, if there is a vaccine for malaria, it is terrific that this discovery will end the suffering of infected people and eradicate the potential to put more through that sickness. It will ultimately result in an increase in world population.

1390	It just means you're a ridiculous person.  Your world would be nothing but propaganda: noise, claptrap, and pathetic fantasies.  The entire economy of a nation might depend on you, but still...
1391	Pretty much as the title implies. Yes, I've played the game and beaten it and I really don't see why this game is being praised as much as it is. Everything about the game is average at best, maybe except for the story, which is 90% of what people talk about when they say that it's a great game. A good portion of the game is either spent walking through a level, watching cutscenes, or engaging in combat or stealth, both of which are done much better in other games.  Every time I ask why people love TLOU, I always get roughly the same answer; how it's an incredible story, and how it's so emotional. And this is certainly true, but what makes it better than other games? How does a good story make up for bland everything else?

1393	The story of The Last of Us is an incredible story that is way better than a lot of other games.  But the game is really about the fighting, stealth, and stealth beating.  As far as story goes, it's average.

1395	Armed attacks, warfare, or violence, can kill individuals or cause groups to leave. Sometimes, though, the violent result is outweighed by the evil that the violence causes. In general, violence is a human right that has its place in the context of a political war. Yet some types of violence, such as bombing civilians, for example, ought to be halted. Think of the bombing as a form of warfare.  It kills people, which could end or delay a war or hamper international relations. However, the bombing of civilian areas can also lead to more ill-fated results such as killing innocent civilians, killing unarmed peaceful protesters, destroying valuable infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, and destroying or damaging civilian facilities such as hospitals.
1396	All of these methods of killing result in long and painful deaths. Why is one acceptable but the other not? A bullet wound to the abdomen can cause intestinal agony for months, which seems on par with mustard gas. If infection sets in, possibly worse. Having your limbs blown off while you are conscious is probably worse than being gassed. Being burned by the flames from an explosion is probably on par with mustard gas burns. Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and doesn't spread to other areas such as civilian areas.
1397	All of these methods of killing can be as painful or more painful than a bullet wound to the abdomen.

1400	The establishment of Israel is sometimes cited as necessary because of the need to protect the people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.

1402	Why would it be ok to disenfranchise a significant portion of the population in Palestine for the benefit of a minority within the Jewish race?
1403	Israel is the victors of this particular conflict. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old?

1404	Establishing an Israeli state is often cited as being necessary based on the need to protect Jewish heritage, which is a strange and rather outlandish notion. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate the population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? If Jewish security is the issue, then the annexation of a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been far more moral than simply conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If the state of Israel is the most moral state, why not work towards moral peace negotiations?
1405	Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:  1. Putting a large amount of value on sex by viewing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility.   2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship.  3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc.   I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!
1406	“Sex should be enjoyed like any other pleasure, and is not viewed as something to only do with one person in a relationship.” Make it simpler and direct.
1407	The foundation of our society is built on family life. In order for it to last and function well, people need to maintain healthy sexual relationships.
1408	One benefit of sex is that it can be a great outlet for both sides. However, it can also lead to tension in a relationship due to the fact that sexuality is only one part of a relationship. If you put a lot of value on sex, it can create possible tension. Thus, making it less valuable can allow both sides to explore other aspects of a relationship.
1409	Sex is an integral part of a relationship.  It should be equally important. It is something that both parties want or need to communicate and express and build on.  The value of sex can change, but it shouldn't be dependent on what may happen in the future.
1410	It's a lottery, and luck of the draw. The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in overtime does not produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either. There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play. It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.
1411	It's a lottery - luck of the draw.  It will decide a winner, to be sure.  But the better team doesn't always win.  And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.  The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in overtime doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.  Why not?  How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?  There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.  It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.  CMV

1414	In the game of soccer, luck of the draw, more probably, it will decide a winner, to be sure, but the better team doesn't always win. And the truth is that shoot outs are exciting as any other sport can produce, but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup. There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs, but everyone seems to be okay with this style of game play. I don't understand why people have to be so cynical about it. At the same time, it wouldn't be so bad if the cups were big enough, but it's not. I think it's nice that many people love soccer, but it doesn't make sense that some people find it so exciting to have it decided by shots!
1415	There are some games that people play that seems very "boring".  It's not that kids play video games.  People don't buy them as kids because it's a lot of work and the games don't truly satisfy them.  If you have any kid that you're responsible for, don't encourage them to play Pokemon Go.  It's dangerous!
1416	The Pokemon craze I grew up with entirely missed me.  Being on Reddit, I see how it's become a cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I've never had any contact with the cards or games whatsoever.  I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look dumb.  Really dumb.  The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding.  CMV that Pokemon games are aimed at kids and there's no point to trying them for the first time as an adult.
1417	To be honest I am amazed that Pokemon came out in the first place and how much it has become a Cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine.  I never had any contact with the card or the games. I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look unbelievably dumb.  Really, really dumb.  The games, from what I can tell, combine the thrill of turn-based combat with the fun of grinding.  This is what you have to say about something when you are trying to reinvent it into something else.
1418	By my observation, Pokemon is the cultural touchstone for the generation born after mine, but I've never had any contact with the cards or games whatsoever. I've seen some bits of the TV shows, and they look dumb. Really dumb. It's really unfortunate. It's kind of like the way the theme songs are used in the movie. The Pokémon movies always have a very catchy, two syllable title song that has the lyrics, "Stop, Land, Peck, Advance, Peck, Rock, Peck, Peck, Peck". This is used to set the tone and get the audience in the mood, and yet the description of the game in the movie never mentions it. Most of the discussion in the board revolves around the way you play the game, and not necessarily the things you get to experience when you are not actively playing the game.
1419	When Pokemon's first Shinies like Ash and Brock were released they were aimed at kids. They are not aimed at adults and they are meant to be played with the appropriate currency called Pokecalls. You are not recommended to even try playing them as an adult.
1420	In general I agree that jokes should be appropriate, but I do not expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang.
1421	The current situation in North Korea is not a laughing matter. When scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation.  I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.  And yes... I do expect the top comment to be a joke about being banned from /r/pyongyang
1422	Being sarcastic and disrespectful towards other cultures and religions is not a good way to deal with sensitive issues. You shouldn't be saying ridiculous things about something as sensitive as North Korea. I feel North Korea's cases should be considered serious as they are serious issues. Also be nice to other r/danubian countries because no one is immune to discrimination.
1423	Thank you for supporting my statement. I know humor can be an important tool and people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they're just jokes.

1425	It is currently legal for people to to undergo hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity as much as scientifically possible. I have a few gay friends that resent the LGBT acronym and transgendered peoples' "uninvited" inclusion with the gay movement. They feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today. I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
1426	The right to be married is currently denied to most gay people in the world, but I understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance, want want their voices heard, but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
1427	It’s not really about the inclusion of transgendered people. It’s about gays making their voices heard, which is a legitimate demand, but it’s not an important issue. The transgendered struggle is actually just a play on words. The bisexual would be fighting for their rights.
1428	Transgendered people want to be accepted as they are, and being wronged by misplaced political correctness is an injustice to them. The LGBT people are also out to be accepted as they are and for equal rights. Again, I understand that these two groups are talking the same language and want the same thing, but they should not undermine one another's platforms in an effort to grab more attention.
1429	What other cause would the transgendered movement need to fight for except societal acceptance? There is already legal reform that allows hormone treatment and surgery to change their identity. I have a few gay friends that resent the LGBT acronym. They feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today. I completely understand that transgendered people wish to be heard in society and want the inclusion of their voices, but co-opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
1430	These graduation ceremonies are not just little milestones in the student's life; rather, they are primary responsibilities. Change the way people view their graduation ceremonies.
1431	Over the past couple of weeks, I have attended or seen pictures for family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation. I am not talking about a simple gathering, I mean full on ceremony, commencement speeches, hours long, etc full on graduation ceremonies. I feel that celebrating all these milestones in the exact same way as the final goal, that student's actual graduation ceremony completely diminishes their effort in the first year of college.  Change my view.
1432	Celebrating all these minor milestones in the exact same way as the final goal completely diminishes the person that you aim to be when you graduate and attend a university or college.
1433	Over the past few weeks I have attended or seen pictures for family member graduation ceremonies for kindergarten, 6th grade, 8th grade, and my daughter's high school graduation.

1435	Judaism, as its own proof, claims the Abrahamic parents left Egypt in 1120 BC, meaning that they left around 6000 BC. I argue that Jews were never at Mount Sinai and I suggest a brand new proof, the national revelation proof. Either way the Abrahamic religions, Judaism and Christianity, are less believable than Islam.
1436	Judaism and Christianity rely on the same proof and another leap of faith. Therefore, they are less believable than Islam.
1437	In the first place, 600,000 men were at Mount Sinai because it says so in the bible. Even back in ancient times, getting over a million people to believe that all of their ancestors were at mount Sinai and God spoke to them is an insane task. The ways to fake something like that is EXTREMELY difficult. Therefore, I think the national revelation proof for Judaism is more believable than the proof given by Islam and Christianity.
1438	There have been 600,000 men at the Last Supper in Judaism. Being that there are 600,000 men at the Last Supper, I think we can safely assume there were over a million people gathered. Now, even back then in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all of their ancestors were at the Last Supper and God spoke to them is an insane task. It would be EXTREMELY difficult to fake something like that and get a whole nation to believe it. Therefore, I believe that the national revelation proof makes Judaism the most believable religion.
1439	Judaism believes that there were 600,000 men at Mt Sinai, which it says was that amount that left Egypt.

1440	If an individual is drunk at a party, and another notices them, and requests to have sexual encounters. If the first individual consents, then the individual has waived their right to accuse the first of rape. This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the first's drink or, in any way, use the situation to his or her advantage maliciously (e.g. getting him or her drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse). This was spurred by a discussion between me and my girlfriend the other night. I want to know the arguments for her side, my own being the one presented.

1445	Coors Light tastes like piss water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is.   But Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good.   It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything.   Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties.   These guys are not easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs.   Change my view.
1446	not because it's good enough or bad enough, but because it's *not* like any other beer. The following is an example of a beer snob, "Sorry that hate news came so quickly. Still feels like it's at least half a year away!"

But Yuengling is mass produced and actually pretty good. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's good, but it's not like king of beer or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and some beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please, but they will settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Change my view.
1448	Coors light has been compared to piss-water and is said to taste like a pond by 80-year-old canucks. Labatts has been compared to a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for a beer-snob who doesn't know what beer is. Yuengling is mass produced and actually pretty good. It's not the best beer, mind you. It's good, but it's not like King of Beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention lately, especially in America and a lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please, but they will settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Change my view.
1449	Coors light tastes like piss-water, especially if you don't have ice. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in, mainly because it tastes like soft rocks. Budweiser is for jerks who don't know what beer is. I don't drink beer that is mass produced because I like the process of the brewing beer. But Yuengling is great! It isn't made by actual beer artists, but it tastes good. It's not like King of Beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America. A lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please. But Yuengling is still good. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America. A lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please. But Yuengling is great. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. I'm a real beer snob, but I think Yuengling tastes great. It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything.
1450	Well, if you earn $70,000 and have a salary, I guess it could be used for travel. Is it all you need in life? It certainly contributes to living at a higher level and it certainly makes you feel good when you get it. This is why you are so happy to get a new job after so long.
1451	An average American earns much less than $70,000 and gets by just fine. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would an extra $30,000 benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
1452	An extra $30,000 just wont make me happier. It wont fix the problem of no weekend, or going on holiday. I still don't know what to do with an extra $30,000 each year. Now i'm making about $80,000 which is enough for the basics. No need to get an extra $30,000 each year. I don't see it as a need.
1453	If you have a job that pays you $70,000, chances are you will get a vacation. What will an extra $30,000 help you do that you cannot do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility as far as financial comfort is concerned.
1454	The average American does well with much less than $70,000. So why would anyone want to earn more than $70,000? How would more benefit you? If you have a job that pays you a $70,000 salary, chances are you would have vacation time. What would an extra $30,000 help you do that you can't do with your existing salary? There's no marginal utility in terms of financial comfort as far as I'm concerned.
1455	Yes, artificial intelligence is artificial because a more intelligent being created it but the creating being is still there. That's why you have to respect the creating being and not make anything artificial because otherwise, something is artificial.
1456	Right. If anything we create is artificial we ourselves are artificial intelligence. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can God love me or you?
1457	Anything intelligent that was created by a more intelligent being is artificial. The creating being is the "real" being, while its creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations. Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?
1458	Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?

1460	It depends on how the rich make their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, alot of rich people came across significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring 'illegal aliens' workers who worked for maybe $1-2 per hour instead of hiring a legal worker who they'd be required to pay minum wage, by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. Any rich person who has come across money through dishonest means...I'd say steal it all and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking that money from.
1461	While I agree it's ok for the rich people to come across the money honestly. However, there are some rich people who have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means. Therefore, I'd say steal their money and give it to the poor. They may or may not deserve it...but at least it would be a gesture of 'justice' as they have made others so wealthy and they deserve to have a fair shake.
1462	Every rich person has come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means. I'd say steal all of them and give it to the poor.
1463	It depends on how they made it, some rich people are honest and have earned their money honestly, others are inveverent and have used unhebyt process to gain their money, and some have come accross money through unethical process, perhaps by hiring unwed illegal aliens, cheating on their taxes, pulling other accounting fiascos (just look at Enron), etc. I think that any rich person who has come accross money through either unethical or unsunspected way, he'd steal it, and give it to the poor, and then deport each of them because it's sure that is not how they got their money.
1464	In my point of view, if the rich people come across money honestly, they should be left alone. Some rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means like they hire illegal aliens in lieu of legal workers, cheat on taxes, pulling other accounting tricks, etc. Any rich person that has come across their money through dishonest means, I'd say steal all their money and give it to the poor because that's likely who they were taking it from.
1465	All the nice things about God are: - It is perfect. - God sees evil. - God can do whatever he/she wants. - He/she sees everything. Now, based on those, I suggest creating the following: - God sees evil in the world and has the power to stop it. - Despite this, he/she does not. - Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. - This is contradictory to what it is written about God, and therefore the existence of God cannot be proven.
1466	Before I begin, let's create three basic ideas about God: a. God is perfect. b. God sees all. c. God can do whatever He wants. Now, based on those, we can create the following: 1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), does not. 2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect. 4. Therefore, God doesn't exist.
1467	Before I began let's create 3 base ideas about God, A. God is perfect B. God sees all C. God can do anything he or she wants Now, based on those, we can create the following: 1. God sees evil in the world, and despite having the power to stop it doesn't (B), so then why doesn't God stop it? 2. Any being that sees wrong knows it can be stopped, but takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This contradicts with (1) above, as in the scripture, it is said that God is perfect. 4. Therefore, God doesn't exist

1470	Rowing is def more intensive. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vice versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.

1475	Global warming is a very controversial topic. There's strong scientific evidence that it's caused by the sun, and that carbon dioxide doesn't play a role, but there are people who say it's artificial, created by chemists to make you buy more green products. I do agree that climate control is important to us, but I also think it's more important for our environment to clean itself naturally.
1476	I do believe environmentalism is a great idea. However, recently environmentalism has been categorized as a cult. There is strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. However, the people who are taking the environmental issue so far beyond its limits have just come out with a way to say that we must stop carbon dioxide from causing global warming. They are going to drastically change many aspects of our lives to stop climate change. We are all being told that no more automobiles, no more airplanes, no more growouts, and more strict laws about greenhouse gases in our homes. They are trying to tell us that we must do everything that a dictator wants. I believe they are trying to create a utopia, where they will have complete control over everything. I am tired of their green products, carbon credits, and attempts to waste billions of dollars and slow down our economy. I am tired of an government that constantly tells us we have to take on artificial and evil dictators. These environmentalists have gone far too far in their attempts to control our lives. I would like to discuss this, but it is already late. So I hope you enjoy these rewrite things.
1477	 I agree environmentalism is a great thing. But recently I think it's a cult. They obviously have some good points and do help the planet. But the thing that tickles me off is "global warming". I believe there's strong evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. But these radical environmentalists are trying to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled in order to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic and even with overwhelming scientfic evidence against global warming they persist. I've tired of overpriced green products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down our economy. They've gone from the point of actually focusing on real environmental issues to just feeding the public lies and creating new, pretend problems to waste our time. Discuss
1478	The environmentalists of today are driving me crazy. They keep trying to find new ways to convince people to think and act differently, but they seem to want to control just about everything. As someone who has turned environmentalism into a way of life, I cannot stand all the green products, carbon credits, and wasteful activities that get thrown out as solutions to climate change. I am tired of overpriced "green" products, carbon credits, and attempts by them to waste billions of dollars and slow down America's economy. They have gone from the point of actually focusing on real environmental issues to just feeding the public lies and creating new, pretend problems to waste our time. I am tired of all the green crap out there and I am not willing to accept a global apocalypse. 
1479	Global warming is a thing that is heavily disputed. There is a strong scientific evidence that the earth is warming naturally because of the sun and not our production of carbon dioxide. But environmentalists are literally attempting to form a kind of dictatorship, where so many aspects of life are strictly controlled to stop climate change. Anyone that questions them is a heretic, and even with overwhelming scientfic evidence against global warming, they persist.

1480	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion, sometimes his opinion seems justified, sometimes not. Similarly, someone like Keith Olberman also has opinions which are often justified and often not. Each can wield structured argumentation and each will occasionally stoop to more base forms of persuasion. It's all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.
1481	Every once in a while, Bill O'Reilly or Keith Olberman might have an opinion that is moderately justified and sometimes not. Similarly, CNN's Anderson Cooper or Rush Limbaugh might have opinions that are moderately justified and sometimes not. These people can wield structured argumentation and they will occasionally stoop to more base forms of persuasion, but the audience can disengage and move on. It allows audience to move on or glower as if a skit on David Letterman or even work from home.
1482	There are two parties in the media that both have legitimate perspectives. One, with their reactionary viewpoint can also rely on appeals to established structures of belief. The other, with the progressive viewpoint can go with pure humor to the status quo and can also seek to extort. The final, audience are content with just winking at the sleight of hand.
1483	Bill O'Reilly has an opinion, and there are times when he seems to have a moderate justification to his opinion, but when it turns out to not be so, we can just wink at the sleight of hand. Keith Olberman also has opinions which are sometimes justified and sometimes not, and he can also wield structured argumentation. It's all permissible because the main audience is content in just winking at the sleight of hand.
1484	Olberman's opinion on military expenditures is supposed to be an argument. It is extremely misleading. Olberman keeps saying that military expenditures are wasting money while going on and on about the need for it. He does not give an answer. How you justify military expenditures is not critical, just mention it.
1485	It really depends on the occupation as well as the political settings that ensure those with a high degree are rewarded with adequate salaries. If it happens that the people's political solutions go in line with their personal efforts and not through organising mass protests by the youth, then what is the need for an academic qualification to succeed in life?
1486	For a successful academic career, it is advisable to acquire proper academic qualifications because a good basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is crucial for getting success in life. The ability to master these subjects allows one to calculate, innovate and communicate. These essentials for success cannot be acquired without professional help in schools and colleges.
1487	Academic qualifications ensure success in life because they provide you with the basics in learning. If you master the essentials in mathematics, science and languages, you can get success in life. To master these subjects, professional help in schools and colleges is needed.
1488	To me, Academic qualification ensures success in life, because academic qualifications ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in maths, science and languages is strong, you can get success in life. Mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
1489	Better academic qualifications ensure success in life because if you have well grounded basics in Maths, Science and Languages, you can get success in life because these essentials can calculate, innovate and communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
1490	An optimistic view of the recession is that all of the corporate fat is being trimmed and weeded out. So, the short term job losses and price increases are only temporary. The US has gotten out of worse before (late 70's early 80's situation, and the Great Depression) just to name a few.
1491	An optimistic view of this recession is that all of the corporate fat is being trimmed and weeded out, leaving only the best and most sufficient companies. The short term job losses and price increases are definately a bad thing but they are only temporary.

1495	The present-day crisis was brought on by the auto, petroleum, rubber, and construction industries after World War 2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists devolping solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuels while destroying the environment.
1496	Our present day crisis was brought on by the automobile, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after World War 2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists developing solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuels while destroying the environment.
1497	In point of view, the economy got damaged because the auto, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after WW2 chased the big bucks, destroying public transportation, building hiways and freeways, malls and using fossil fuels. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists, developing solar energy they chased the big bucks and using fossil fuels destroying public transportation and in doing so polluting the environment.
1498	The current problems of the economy in the United States, its brought on by the industries such as automobiles, petroleum, rubber and construction companies after World War 2. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists evolving solar energy, they have chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, malls and depending on fossil fuels while destroying the environment. This is just a case of the chickens coming home to roost
1499	Capitalism brought the present day crisis after World War II. Instead of maintaining, increasing public transportation and as suggested by scientists developing solar energy, they chased the big bucks destroying public transportation, building highways and freeways, shopping malls and depending on fossil fuels while destroying the environment. It's all coming back to a screeching halt with continuing recession, oil addiction and nuclear wars with the NWO programing to implement afterwards.
1500	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for a restriction on new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway), should have restrictions on the number of passengers. Personally, I would also suggest a restriction on how far a newly licensed driver can travel on their own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on their first motorway jaunt.

1502	Perhaps there isn't a clear distinction between "teenagers" and "new drivers". Perhaps that whole section needs to be re-written to focus more on "experienced drivers". Although I wouldn't be against strengthening the legal aspects in places where new drivers are present, because new drivers are out to do the wrong things.
1503	Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers, because in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees should have restrictions on the number of passengers and their age. Personally, I would also suggest a restriction on how far a newly licensed driver can travel on their own, or with them as the sole driver.

1505	The Royal Family in the UK costs them 40 million pounds per year. This is a lot of money, if not more than most of the public schools in the United Kingdom.
1506	Monarchies are just burdens to economies if they are parliamentary monarchies because they don't have the original role - ruling. There are many of examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizen. For example, the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pound per year.

1510	Crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc, all make a person learn new things about her or himself. Deep down, everyone has something that is revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
1511	No you can't really know what makes a person tick.
1512	Being within the same flesh is like sitting at home with your family and all of a sudden your family expands and joins you. You can’t truly know what makes one family tick because one family member can never truly know what is really taking place within the family.
1513	No you cannot really know what makes a person tick.
1514	Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior. With that, you cannot truly know what makes a person tick.
1515	Nothing exists. To utter that sentence is applying existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists is asserting - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing making nothing something indeed!

1520	I don't believe the Phelps clan is protected under the first amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one persons funeral. At that point it is almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. Now, had they been at some other location and were stating their beliefs against all military members or gay people then they would have been fine. But to sing out one person in particular and hold signs up saying "semper fi fag" and "thank god for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.
1521	Singling out one person in particular and holding signs up saying "Semper Fi fag" and "Thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.

1523	When you say your beliefs, you should be able to say what they mean and who you believe they are applicable to. So in this case I do not think the Phelps Clan is protected under the first amendment. I think they crossed the line by singling out one persons funeral. At that point it is almost an emotional hate crime against the Snyder family. If they were in some other situation, say they were saying the same things about army members, or gay people, then they would have been fine. But to say "Semper Fi fag" and "thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.

But to single out one person in particular and hold signs up saying "Semper Fi fag" and "Thank God for dead soldiers" is a direct emotional attack and should not be protected under the first amendment.
1525	It was an incredibly mean thing to say. Why not simply say that the article's writer is a disabled person in need of support? That's one more thing she can use against her.
1526	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and she made a point of commenting while trying to be funny, her attempt at golf. While trying to be funny she said her golfing was like the Special Olympics, which caused quite a bit of controversy. I think it's one of the worst things she has ever said, so what do you guys think?
1527	In 2002 Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny she said that her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics. The article caused quite a bit of controversy, and I think this has to be one of the meanest things she has ever said. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense some times, but you can clearly tell that she is making fun of mentally disabled people here. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it's one of the worst things she has ever said...what do you guys think?
1528	Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny, she said that her trying to golf was like the Special Olympics.The article caused quite a bit of controversy, because her opinion could offend people who are autistic. I think she's trying to make fun of the mentally disabled, but I disagree that she is making fun of them. What do you guys think?
1529	In the essay, Ann wrote an article and in part of it while attempting to be funny, she said that "my trying to golf is like the Special Olympics." The controversy sparked by this essay was quite a bit of turmoil as it was made about a mentally handicapped person, which was uncalled for. I like some of what Ann has to say, she makes sense some times, but you can clearly tell that she is making fun of mentally handicapped people here. That is absolutely uncalled for and I think it's one of the worst things Ann has ever said.
1530	Uh, lemme see. If you give us examples, we will list those reasons.
1531	All murderers should get executed, even Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson who were much more conspiracy theory probabilities than Hitler.
1532	At 82 years old, a man might have died of natural causes. If the government wanted him dead, they would have killed him by giving him high doses of methamphetamine and the many other drugs that he chewed. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more conspiracy theory probabilities.. lol...
1533	82, assuming it's him, is way too old to have been born with his inventions. It's only a logical probability. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley? That would be much more likely to have been conspiracy theory.
1534	In point of view, I think it's kind of like the planets. The earth should be another planet, but its not, because who could wish that. I think its cool though. Yeah, there are countries, like USA that ask too many questions and people like the movies are beginning to even like answering those questions that the people don't ask.
1535	In point of view, I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. A happy surprise was that it was taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet, they tasted good enough that I ate both. The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc. I could've taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos but instead, I ate them.

1537	 Because I was starving, I decided to live wild by trying out a taco that sounded really good. I was surprised that it was taco Tuesday when the food was actually really good. Yes, the tacos might have looked poor, but they were huge and fresh. The salsa too was really good. I made a good decision to take a few picture as it has so much content of meat.
1538	http://www.thetimes.com/article/2006/09/17/NOVAtns_shopping/the_snacks_big_changes_a_rustic_a_rustic_whole_food_very_best_bandits/ the Times. About Spring rolls, that is what you want best.   They are sweet and sour - a bit like a Chinese salted egg tapioca, but with lots of filling. A hot towel warmer was a welcome addition and would be easily forgotten about in this consumer-driven society! The worst part about the place were the chickens, real chickens! I really, really wish I would've had meat tacos instead of chicken.  Good long waffle fries (my favorito).
1539	Wow.      I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out.      A happy surprise was that it’s taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would’ve been plenty.      Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that’s worse because I’m quite full now).      The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc.      I could’ve taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos but instead, I ate them.
1540	Only take cash and feel a little bit unsafe if they don't have debit or another way to pay. Order at the counter and food at your table. Would go back for coffee break.
1541	Crude, rude and a constant reminder of the slums that are an offshoot from it. The interior is gross, some of the screens are broken, smells are somewhat unpleasant. The only thing I enjoyed the most was the lovely views over the port and the harbour, I hope they retain them. You could easily see how and why Beguine made it to the top and as someone who has been to Spa regularly, I was satisfied.
1542	The bar is a relaxed place to be, with nice terrace and good variety menu. However only takes cash. Last time I was there the ATM didn't work either, although I don't really like using my card with unknown ATM machines. They should at least have debit cards or Apple Pay. Other than that. Order at the counter and food at your table. Would go back for coffee break.
1543	The terrace is relaxing and nice to be there. But they take cash. I've been there last time and the ATM didn't work either. But I'd like to use my card, so they have to have debit or Apple Pay. Other than that. Order at the counter and food at your table. I would go back for coffee break there.

1545	The great man invented the Cheesecake Factory, and after the great downturn years that follow, the chain keeps growing in popularity. There is no doubt that cheesecake is delicious and very popular, but can it compete with low calorie goods made with fruit instead of added fat and sugar? There is no doubt that many foods on the menu are inspired by Italy, which is a countries with an outstanding culinary history and reputable cheese. But has the chain actually risen to the fame and standards that customers feel it deserves? There are probably very few Cheesecake Factory lovers that have walked away from the mall without buying one. Probably not too many since these moments of indulgence are probably what prompt people to come back on a weekly basis. There could always be a box to go, but at the end of the day, most will wait to sit down in the restaurant before bidding goodbye to the mall.
1546	'The grand daddy of big box food. Tasty? Yes. Inventive? Not really. Oil and butter as substitutes for inventive, creative food? Most likely. It's hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable. The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full "skinnylicious" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit too heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.
1547	Butter and oil are not the best options to add flavor to your meal. Some places have become very creative with other ingredients as substitutes for them, like ketchup, mayo and more. The Cheesecake Factory does a good job managing the demand on the great bones. But I would suggest that if you must eat here, try some of the healthier menu options. My personal preference is the skinnylicious menu for its great variety of food and limited caloric intake.
1548	The main draw of the Cheesecake Factory is their truly unique combination of sarnies, cheesecakes, and calories. Its cheesecakes certainly have the hallmarks of something tasty, though not so inviting for those watching their weight. The oatmeal cheesecake and crumbled wheat cheesecakes are among the best among many that you can find elsewhere. But, the cheesecakes seem to rely too heavily on oil and butter as the main flavor constituents, and they do not offer much else on the menu to offset it.

1552	First time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was on point. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were friendly. The second time I came in I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scratching her butt through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it at this point. I didn't plan on eating anything but politely waited...and waited...and waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait. It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait...Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top. The valley is in freefall and health code standards have gone out the window.

1555	The ambiance was good - very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto. Beyond bland. Didn't taste basil. Didn't taste olive oil. Didn't taste Parmesan. Not sure how that's possible. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. Salad was brown. House Italian tasted like stale parm. Portions were lame for the price (usually you can count on a $14 gnocchi to be pretty hearty - this one would be a'small plate' at most other Italian joints). A very unimpressive $60 meal for the two of us. I'll be returning in the summer to check out "the most romantic patio in Cleveland," hoping another dish will be worth it.
1556	An oddly framed restaurant with a unique vision. I had their grilled tomato chutney, which was a very good salad. As for their dinner, I had the gnocchi pesto. It was not nearly as good as the antipasto and it tasted of bread. My wife had the gnocchi with tomato and chili, and I do not recommend it. It was frankly a disappointment, but more than the food, what made this an even less pleasant meal was the restaurant's food photography. I was not disappointed with the food, but, by the time I made it to the counter to finish my meal, I was upset that they had hung pictures of models with tiny and slim bodies. I would have been more comfortable eating my meals with a blank wall behind me.

1558	The ambiance was good. We had the gnocchi pesto. The gnocchi was dry, the basil wasn't that stinkin' good. The pesto was just a muddy grey paste. The house Italian tasted like stale parm. We ordered a side of bacon-wrapped hotdogs, which came with a cinnamon roll, pumpernickel bread stick and something called a 'cheese dough ball. The bite-sized sides were really basic. The bacon wrapped hotdogs were actually okay - not great, but not bad. The pumpernickel bread stick was OK, too. The cheese dough ball was heavenly. Now, I don't see anyone living anywhere in this world describing this as "cheesy." I know. It couldn't be simpler. Cheesy. Pasta that's just the right size, not too oily, a nice crisp outside, perfectly cooked inside, the perfect blend of tomatoes, parsley and olive oil. The combination of lemony pesto and creamy Parmesan cheddar cheese is so so tasty. Would highly recommend.

1560	Our waiter was fine. He was very polite and attentive. That was the best part of the meal! That's sad. So disappointed in the food here. Absolutely horrible lasagna. Might be the worst I've ever had (maybe chef boyardee is worse - MAYBE!!!). Don't go here to eat. So many better places in LV! Absolutely bland and boring food. Calamari was just meh. The meatballs were ok but kind of bland. Don't eat here. Cannot stress that enough. Unless you want to overpay for bad food. Very disappointed!!!

1566	Sometimes a girl just wants some matzo ball soup and this place is one of my favorites... I will say it has been inconsistent from time to time (sometimes being less flavorful than others but that is not always the case--- I have been satisfied more times than not. Sandwich selection is good, veggie burger is one of the better ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. We often use Wheel Delivery to get the Smallman Street Deli and everything is always marked properly and the orders never have issues (unlike many places who do large lunches unfortunately). I will keep patronizing this yummy place...
1567	Although occasionally they may miss orders, they've been consistent in their service and nutrition and therefore are among the best options.
1568	There is nothing wrong with burgers in general, but I find that this place fails in the creative burger department.
1569	This place is only mediocre since it is inconsistent from time to time (sometimes less flavorful than others but that is not always the case I have been satisfied more times than not). Sandwich selection is great, veggie burger is one of the best ones I have tried, and they are generous with their portions. They are always reliable and punctual in their deliveries and orders never have any issues (unlike other places who do large lunches and it ends up being horrible). I will keep patronizing them and when I'm going to Olive Branch I will come by Smallman and order this salad.
1570	Clothes of school uniforms are so weird that you can no more bullshit them or even tell the truth. One good reason why is because most sexual molestation happens within the school community. One more reason is because gay people try to pretend that they don't even like men and only want girls for playing in the playground.
1571	Teenagers need to wear smart dresses and not dirty school cloths, and obviously there should be no bullying. Reason being, no one can bully someone else because of the dress they wear.
1572	I think we should not wear school uniforms because their so weird and the good reason why is that no more bulling and also THERE DUMB STUPID AND GAY

1575	The argument against IE is that it has Windows preinstalled. I have seen a lot of advantages of Firefox.
1576	IE has better features than Firefox. IE is pre-installed, and so does Firefox. Windows is more secure, IE is more secure than Firefox.
1577	It is being argued that IE has a lot of its advantages because Windows has it pre-installed, and from what I've heard, they're going to get rid of that. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.
1578	IE has nothing going for it when it comes to speed or add-ons, Firefox has it.
1579	IE only has the advantage that it's pre-installed on Windows. From what I've heard, they are going to get rid of that too. Everything from speed to add-ons, Firefox wins.

1585	If my husband committed murder, I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took.

1590	No, I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught, I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
1591	No, I wouldn't turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for each other through good or through worse and I would give her anything to help her but don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I would not go down with her because most likely I would have a family to take care of and wouldn't leave them for anything.
1592	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse.

1593	No I would not turn my spouse in because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse. I would not go with her even if she was to get caught. I would also have a family to take care of. Also, I would not let her ruin my child's life.

Most likely I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.
1595	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.
1596	To be honest, I'm not sure if I would turn my spouse in if I murdered him. If it was down right cold-blooded murder, yes I would.
1597	If it was down right cold blooded murder I would turn them in, but since I love my spouse and would like to keep it that way, I would not turn them in.
1598	While it is true that love binds us together, it is also true that it should lead us to uphold the values that God has placed in us. On the flip side, in the case of misogyny, there is no given base where he makes the responsibility all hers. If her husband would bring something in or stand for something then he should live with the morality.
1599	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would.
1600	I think books are better because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. I am not completely against television but I do believe that television is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people.
1601	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. TV is also more interesting than reading books.
1602	Nowadays children only play video games or watch TV even getting educated on it. Also, video games can cause children to go and commit crimes which can lead to prison, and they do not have a legal right to argue about it. Books, on the other hand, can cause children to have better vision, better reading, better writing skills, and a lot of other good things.
1603	TV is better than books because TV can bring you news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.

1615	According to Ramesh Sethi, the GDP of India is going to increase within a period of 5 years. They have enough money to feed all the poor people. How can we even imagine them to lead the world?
1616	Even as an Indian citizen..... I don't think so, even in the next 5 years, because of so much unemployment, I don't think the GDP of India will increase. They don't have enough funds to feed all the poor. How can they even imagine leading the world?
1617	Although Indians are almost half a billion, I do not think that the GDP of India will increase in the next 5 years because they have not enough funds to feed all the poor people they have. How can we even imagine them to lead the world?
1618	If there was enough unemployment, the GDP of India would increase. But there is not even enough funds to feed the poor. How can they even lead the world?
1619	Even if an Indian citizen became president, unemployment would not decrease because of so much inflation. Therefore, it won't be possible to reach the dream level of prosperity.
1620	Being fatherless is better than having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you don't want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And there's always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.

1623	Being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And there is always going to be other people by your side helping you through life.
1624	Being fatherless is better than having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you don't want to be looking up to a guy who does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on yourself with no need of a father being there. And there will always be other people by your side helping you get through life.
1625	Being fatherless is much better than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen and I havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disappointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.
1626	Being fatherless is a better choice than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very unkind. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and I have never heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I do not know him, and because he is not around I am never set up for any disappointment. So I think being fatherless is much better.
1627	 I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and I haven't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.
1628	It is better to be fatherless than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like. My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and I haven't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him and because he is not around I am never set up for any disappointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.
1629	It doesn't bother me because I don't know him. And he isn't around I am never set up for any disappointment. So I think that being fatherless is much better.
1630	I rather not be raised by a poor man who is either not caring or lazy. I would be better off raised by my own mother who is loving and care about me, works everyday to make money for us, and is patient and caring with me.
1631	Id rather be fatherless than have a lousy father. Having a lousy father who tires to tell me what to do but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. I rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to put food on the table.
1632	I prefer to be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table.
1633	It would be better for your daughter if you father stood up and took charge of his life instead of letting her father, who's immature, impose himself on your daughter. She deserves better than that.
1634	It would not make me so mad if the father didn't say anything to me and did nothing for the first 18 years. I understand that a few things can be done better or differently but when a man doesn't do anything for the first 18 years he shouldn't come in and spoil my life.
1635	Nazism was a cultural revival project that was set up by Hitler to bring back the cultural heritage of the country. Farquhar wanted to gain control through his actions.
1636	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people, and Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
1637	Fu Shou Henreign revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
1638	Farquhar revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays. He did a lot for the people while Gangsak just wanted to gain control by his actions.
1639	He revived the cultural heritage of the region through setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people. Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
1640	It is wrong. Porn is wrong because you are being lustful. Porn is wrong even more when you are married and cheating. But we all have been lustful in the past, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
1641	It's wrong! Pornography is wrong because you are being lustful: it is even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which counts as cheating on them. But everyone has been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
1642	It's wrong. Porn is wrong because you're being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
1643	Sex is wrong. Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your spouse. But I think all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
1644	With all due respect, pornography is wrong because it is a form of lust. Lust is wrong and you should stop doing it.
1645	Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting the theory of evolution, while there are massive amounts supporting the theory of creation. True. But, the theory of evolution does not rule out the theory of creation. Since the theory of creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and the theory of evolution can, the theory of creation is the best possible theory.
1646	There is a vast amount of evidence supporting evolution, whereas there is very little or no evidence supporting creation. This is part of an argument to support creation. True, but, we cannot say that creation is wrong because it lacks an explanation for the origins of the "particles" that caused evolution. Although evolution is good, and definitely possible, it does not rule out the possibility of creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
1647	All debates are based on convincing evidence; There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. However, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.
1648	Evidence is the basis for debates. Since there is no evidential support for creation, it is not possible to prove creation. However, creation can not be ruled out by any means, nor can evolution. This means that creation must be accepted, since there is no explanation that is better than it, and since both can be wrong. Since creation cannot be ruled out and evolution cannot, creation must be the best explanation.
1649	Explanations must be convincing and can stand against the test of accepted truth. We cannot say that creation is false because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the particles that would cause evolution theory. However, evolution cannot be ruled out in any way, so the best possible theory is creation.
1650	Well, there was some evolutionary biologists who said that species have certain characteristics and properties that randomly change. For example, frogs were once water-inhabiting but scientists have discovered that frogs change their habitats to be land-breathing. Species are made up of members that are related with each other and are suitable for one environment.
1651	I am not making a big deal of animals lacking certain traits because they didn't evolve so I don't see them evolving, rather I think that because they have those traits they have to have evolved, like having its mouth open all the time. There are scorpions that don't have a tail and were evolved for predation. But when they acquire one I am sure they would have had to have it. Scorpions are definitely successful species.
1652	Why do you think an animal acquires a trait that it wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties". I noticed that you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change. What insects are you talking about?
1653	Although it is true that species can be described by certain characteristics and properties, it should be noted that an organism can acquire new characteristics through evolution.
1654	You proved my point that species have certain characteristics. I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change. I noticed you didn't mention the point about insects. Also, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person... what insects are you talking about?
1655	There is an operating system called Window's that has been there since the DOS years. IE is a type of operating system. Firefox is a browser.
1656	Internet Explorer was there since forever and is installed in a typical computer. IE is universal. Firefox still needs to be downloaded or installed on our computers
1657	IE is used to be a part of the operating systems and is still used in a typical computer, but the new versions of the operating system like Chrome, Opera and some other browsers support the Firefox better.
1658	IE was there since then and is already installed in a typical computer. IE is a universal browser. Firefox still needs to be downloaded or installed
1659	Internet explorer has been there and is already installed in a typical computer. IE is UNIVERSAL! Firefox still needs to be downloaded or installed
1660	In my opinion, I think that it should be compulsory in schools to have PE classes because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes were compulsory, there would be much less fat children. Of course, some health classes should be included, so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
1661	PE classes should be offered to every child because they offer a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes were offered, there would be fewer fat children. Of course also some health classes should be offered so children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
1662	Being asked to do a little exercise is more than enough for the average child, no matter how much food or how much television. PE classes and health classes will make the average child well educated and make sure he has enough food. So in my opinion, PE classes are more important than the media.
1663	There should be obligatory PE classes in schools because it offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes were obligatory there would be much less fat children. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and so they won't be obese anymore.
1664	In my opinion, it should be obligatory for kids to have PE classes. PE offers children a bit of exercise. If in every school of the world PE classes were obligatory there would be much less fat kids. Of course also some health classes should be included so that children know how to have a basic diet and they won't be obese anymore.
1665	Many people die from lack of physical education because that is why your aunt or uncle is in the hospital and it's because of lack of physical exercise because lack of physical education means getting fat and sleep doesn't work properly because you can not sleep at times because lack of physical exercise means not having the super great sex in your life.
1666	Yes! and yes! and yes! and definitely a damn bloody YES. Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s).
1667	Yes, and yes, and yes, and definitely a god damn bloody yes. Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s).
1668	No one really knows why your aunt or uncle is in hospital, but it's a definite causalty of lack of physical activity. There are millions of people that are too fat and need to take physical activities to control their weight, and if there isn't enough physical activity for this reason then the people with fat overhang will be in the hospital. Also, the lack of physical activity cause a severe health problem for people and they cannot sleep properly. Our ancestors once lived a much more physical existence and they know the value of physical activity. Lack of physical activity has caused our ancestors to lose all their health and vitality, and that's the main reason behind their mortality. Sex with your girlfriend(s) is becoming one of the preoccupations of men in our time and without physical activities this whole situation wouldn’t be possible. That's the main reason I live
1669	Yes, and yes, and yes, and definitively a god damn bloody yes. Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times. Lack of physical education is the reason why you are not having super great sex with your girlfriend(s)
1670	While Raffles was away, Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore.
1671	Singapore is still a prosperous city now despite the fact that its famous master Yap Kar Ho, the Datu (ruler) was not around. He was not able to protect

1673	Peter Pearce defended Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.
1674	During the Dutch colonial domination of Singapore (1611–1765), Farquar protected the island and attracted merchants to it while Raffles was away.
1675	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.

1680	Why should Raffles deserve the title of "Founder"? Farquhar developed the island with all his ideas contributing to the development.
1681	 The island of Singapore wasn't discovered by Raffles. With all his ideas, he only helped in the development of the island. So why in the world should he deserve the title of'singapore's founder'? Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
1682	raffles didn't care about the citizens, didn't spare a thought at all. So why in the world should he deserve the title of'singapore's founder'? Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
1683	He did not care about the citizens, he did not spare a thought for their development. So what if he discovered the island and helped in its development, he did not contribute in any manner in the Singapore's development. So why in the world should he deserve the title of 'Singapore's Founder'? Fah Quirk developed the Island and all of his ideas contributed to the development.
1684	He discovered the island, but he did not help in the least in Singapore's development. So why should he deserve the title of ‘Singapore’s founder?’ Farquhar developed the island with all his ideas contributing to the development.
1685	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles showed that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
1686	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people saw Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
1687	When Farquhar left Singapore, the people recognized Farquhar as their founding gentleman and not Raffles.
1688	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
1689	More people were there to send off Farquhar than Raffles because the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
1690	Even in the short span of time Farquar has been able to destroy rat and centipede infestation, Raffles couldn't even do that at all.
1691	In reality, Farquar only did a few days work while Raffles failed to act at all.
1692	Raffles didn't do anything about the problem at all because the problem was not a big one and it took just a few days for Farquar to finish destroying it.
1693	Whenever he ended his military career as a major general, Farquar weeded out many problems. It took only a few days for Farquar to finish destroying the infestation, whereas Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
1694	Farquar weeded out many problems, such as the rat and centipede infestation. It took him only a few days to finish destroying the infestation, whereas Raffles did not do anything about the problem at all.
1695	What if the baby was to be the next Leonardo da Vinci? There is a simple counter to this: What if this person who has been pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world and never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
1696	you should know before you even want to have a baby that if the child is a gift of nature it will not be the next DaVinci.
1697	There is a simple counter to this argument: what if this person who is having the baby is to be a legendary figure in the world, but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
1698	What if the person who has pregnant is a legendary figure in the world, but he or she can't get a decent job because he or she has to raise a baby that he or she was not prepared for?
1699	Why is the quoted text okay. It does not alter the meaning of the sentence and will not lead to misunderstanding.
1700	Life is around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a lab is purely because of failure to focus research on the area of replication for those billions of years. For example, we have the same amount of research spending focused on replicating life that we have during the last 100 years as in the past 100 years. Even DNA
1701	Life has been around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. Life can't be recreated in the laboratory because it is infinitely complex.
1702	 Life has been around for billions of years. There are things that happened millions of years ago that we don't understand. Therefore, it may not have been easy to recreate life in a lab. However, there are some things that we could replicate with lab techniques that happened millions of years ago that are difficult for us to replicate today, such as
1703	Life has been around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years of failure to actually attempt to. :)
1704	Humans have been around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a lab is purely because researchers have failed to devote that same billions of years trying.
1705	At issue is the first humans. Some believe that there was an Asian garden of Eden and an African garden of Eden and so on. The issue is not if there was an Asian or African Eden. The issue is rather, who created those. In fact, it has been argued that there was a European Eden and a Turkish Eden and so on. So who created those?
1706	If you can then please do so, illuminate us with your facts, do you have brain scans of the first humans? How about average organ sizes, hair patterns, facial characteristics? Heart rate records? You want the truth? There is actually no Garden of Eden. The Stone Age children evolved into people. Humans are a single species and we got our distinct traits from our mixed genetic pools which happened through evolution. Humans get the mixed traits they got from their mixed genetic pools by participating in all their mixed ancestral activities. Humans can, in fact, participate in all the ancestral activities they performed in their mixed ancestral pasts. The only ones who cannot participate in all their mixed ancestral activities are the ones who joined the African branch right after leaving the original human group. The fact remains however that the genetic pool from these different branches of humans all share a common ancestral and genealogy, which can be traced all the way back to the original human group. When the original human group encountered the different branches of humans, the admixed genetic pools of the ancestors of these people mixed with their genes, and the resulting hybrid genetic
1707	Many human adaptations involve genetic and environmental influences. The fact that you believe they were all created in the same continent may be a genetic factor. Be sure you examine the evidence, so we know if you are making a very similar claim to what an omnivore would make.
1708	What do you actually believe?
1709	During a greenhouse effect, the different racial characteristics of modern humans could be a result of the fact that they inhabited different areas.
1710	But if you want to believe in creationism or evolutionism....whatever the evolution you choose...that is personal and honestly, I didn't mean to make it seem like it was some sort of big step. So why not go ahead and have different ideas. Because that is part of life right? Its all debate and what you wanna believe. I have no problem with that! Let the people debate and discuss and decide for themselves if they think it exists or not and let it be! But why say it is important or what should or shouldn't be said? And I always thought, debate is like a book study. You read it. Sometimes you make comments and I don't agree with those and that's just how it is. But debaters don't have to agree and you're just making complains I don't agree with right? So stop saying, this person did that and that happened then. I happen to say...all the time. It's all part of life and life goes on. I never said, I don't care what my opinion is. I just say it! I don't want your opinion on it. I just don't have. So don't say
1711	If you want to believe in creationism, that's great. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is necessary.
1712	I'm not sure why it's so important. We're here. Whoop-de-doo. So go on and live your life! If you want to believe in creationism, that's great, good for you. If you want to believe in evolutionism, same thing. I understand that the point of debate is to get the opponent to be convinced of your side and everything, but I just don't see why even debating it is necessary.
1713	I don't think that it's hypocritical. It's a subject that has been debated for a long time and everyone seems to have a differing opinion on it.
1714	This paragraph was entirely unnecessary.
1715	Some moths that exhibited different expressions due to external factors were evidence of evolution. However, when different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
1716	There is evidence that Peppered Moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur when different alleles are expressed.
1717	Because different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
1718	Every species has a method to pass on some traits to the next generation, such as males keeping a fighting gene or females keeping a mating gene. If there is enough variation over time, and that variation is kept within the species, this is evolution. In the case of the peppered moth, there is sufficient variation because the environment fluctuates. It causes a mutation, the gene to be expressed, and therefore evolution has occurred.
1719	When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.
1720	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable. Before the theory of evolution, however, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1721	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the question of "who created the creator" seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1722	Before the theory of evolution, people thought that you needed a creator to explain why life can exist on Earth. But, the "the who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1723	Both belief in God and a belief in a complex creator can be fully justified.
1724	An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.
1725	There are seven votes for "Porn is wrong", but no one is willing (able?) to say why.
1726	Is pornography to be considered a crime, or what? I also find it telling that there is 7 votes for porn being wrong, but no one is willing (able?) to say why.
1727	Seven votes for porn? I find it telling that there's, as of now, seven votes for "porn is wrong", but no one is willing (able?) to say why.
1728	It is striking that while there are seven votes for "Porn is wrong", there is no willingness (or indeed, ability!) to say why.
1729	It is telling that there are 7 votes for "pornography is wrong," but nobody is willing (or able) to say why.
1730	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it is not wrong it's genius.
1731	Don't the people in this world have sex every day. There are more people that read a book every day. Making money is not wrong because
1732	Everyone has sex, so prostitution isn't wrong or bad. It's genius.
1733	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it is NOT wrong it's genius.
1734	Everyone has sex, so making a profit on it isn't wrong it's genius. Why should you bring it up?
1735	There are no objective words about porn that are clear enough, so the reasons you would not give this as a reason are in sync with the purpose of the article: porn is bad.
1736	It's not wrong to listen porn as long as you consider porn not as an alternative to faith, moral, and family values.
1737	Listen porn is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Porn not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
1738	Listen porn is not right because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Porn not only teaches you but also gives you a prime example.
1739	Listen porn is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration of porn because of parents. Porn not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
1740	Being able to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
1741	Someone shouldn't be forced to do either if they choose to. Although helping others is very important, I'd rather take care of myself because, you know, it's my life.
1742	Being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life is a great idea. Being an ace pilot is an amazing skill. Do both!
1743	My preference would be to do both but since I have to choose, I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
1744	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose, I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone else's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
1745	I think that school uniform is a good idea because it makes students look nice and tidy. It also makes it easier to know who is study in which school and how we look like at school and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend so much time to choose clothes to school
1746	I think school uniforms are a good idea because first they make the students look nice and tidy. Second we can know who is studying in which school and who is in a same school with us and finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much time to choose clothes to school
1747	It makes the students look nice and tidy. Second it can let you know who is study in which school and finally it saves time.
1748	School uniform is a good idea. First it's a nice dress code that can make students look nice and tidy. Second we can know that who's studying in which school. And finally it's convenient because we don't have to spend too much of time to choose clothes for school.
1749	There is a reason why uniforms at school are used for good look of students, and recognize them easily. The uniform is comfortable for students and save their time in school.
1750	Instead of getting a lousy father I would get one, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.
1751	Better have a lousy father than not have one at all. Father are a huge thing in a child life... as a father is, at least, it is meant to protect you and teach you. Unlike many supposed heros. It's a great support. I think lousy fathers are like that, because they want their son or daughter to be as perfect as possible, or so I guess.
1752	Your father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. And I guess, lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or daughter to be as perfect as possible.
1753	You should let your parents be there when you need them. You can count on your father on anything, and your lousy fathers are like that. They love their child, and they want their son or daughter to be as perfect as possible.
1754	Doing good to others without expecting any in return, and having a lousy father is a more unique human quality than not having one at all. Do good to others without expecting any in return. That is part of being human. Having a lousy father would be a more unique human quality than not having one at all.
1755	It is better to have a bad father than to be fatherless, having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
1756	I think having a lousy father is better than being Fatherless, especially living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
1757	Having a lousy father isn't that bad. Other than living with the idea that you didn't have one or having the doubt of how could it be to have one.
1758	Being Fatherless and living with the idea that you didn't have one or the doubt of how could it be to have one is not that bad.
1759	It depends on how you see it. Dad's make life easier for their daughters. Dad's help, comfort and love their daughters. Depending on what type of father you have there may be some advantages and disadvantages.
1760	If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father then you don't have anybody to count with or tell him your problems.
1761	It is better to have a single parent than a fatherless because, you can count on your father. No matter what your father is, always going to be there for you in the good and bad times. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father than you don't have nobody to count with or tell him your problems.
1762	Being born with no father can be a problem but being fatherless is worse.
1763	In a very personal way, if you don't have a father it is like you don't have a father. No matter what your father is always going to be there for you in good and bad times. If you don't have a father, you're not really going to know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father, you're not going to have anybody to count with.
1764	Having a lousy father is a worse thing than having no father at all because you can't count on your father. You have to be in peace with yourself and your problems. If you don't have a father you don't really know what is right or wrong. If you don't have a father, than you don't have anybody to count with or tell him your problems.
1765	By choice, I would pick having a lousy father over not having a father at all because, there will be a point where you may need his help. I know that I do not have the father I would like, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
1766	Being born with a bad father is not good. For one, it can make you feel lonely or even worse. But if you need his help in a difficult situation, try to do it. If you like your father, help him. If he likes you, also help him.
1767	I'd have to pick having a lousy father, than not having a father at all, because I may need his help (it may not help but at least you tried). I know that I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again there are times where he does the dumbest things, and makes me laugh. I know that I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
1768	Having a lousy father than not having a father at all is because there will be a time when you may need his help. But I know I have a lousy father, and he gets me mad sometimes, but there are also times when he is doing the dumbest things that make me laugh. I know I don't have the father I want, but I still love him, even though he is lousy.
1769	There is a point where you need the father but don't want his lousy qualities. I know I have a lousy father, and there are times that he gets me mad, but then again, there are times where he does the dumbest things and makes me laugh. I know I don't have the father I want, but I still love him no matter how lousy he is.
1770	To have a lousy father is better than to not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, there is always a possibility of becoming good at it. To be fatherless, there's no chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.
1771	Having a lousy father is better than not having one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means there is a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be fatherless there is no chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father is better.
1772	To not have a father isn't good, but not having a bad father might be better. Someone who is not there, has the chance to be there. So if someone is bad at something, it's a chance for them to be good. Fatherless people will never be fathers, but if the lousy ones don't exist, the goodness ones might.
1773	Healing damage done by your own father is not good because one day he may prove to be a cruel person to you in a bad way and you will never be able to forgive him.
1774	It seems to me that it'd be better to have a poor or a lousy father than to be fatherless. If someone is bad at something, there is a possibility that one day he may be good at it. To be fatherless there is no chance of having a good father. So I would say the worst case scenario is to have a poor or a lousy father.
1775	Estimates variously place worldwide bottled water sales at between $50 and $100 billion each year, with the market expanding at the startling annual rate of 7 percent. Bottled water is big business. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well.

1777	According to various estimates, worldwide bottled water sales are between $ 50 and $100 billion each year and the market is growing at an impressive 7 percent rate. Bottled water is big business. But in terms of sustainability, bottled water is a dry well.
1778	Estimates vary widely but range from between $50 and $100 billion each year. Most estimates placed global bottled water sales at between $50 billion and $75 billion last year. Put together, these figures do not encompass the U.S. market, which could range from $58 billion to $65 billion. The sale of water in bottles is big business. For better or for worse, there’s only so much bottled water a person can keep in their home, so it’s advisable to have a large water supply alternative.
1779	The global bottled water market is valued at over $50-$100 billion annually, growing at an average rate of 7 percent a year. However, bottled water is a dry well for what it is; it is highly inefficient, highly polluting, highly expensive and far from sustainable.

1795	The bottles are a safe source of water and are guaranteed safety.
1796	Water bottles are a safe source of water and it's guaranteed.
1797	it provides all the benefits of bottled water without the health risks of chemical contamination.
1798	Water bottles are a safe source of water and guarantee safety
1799	The water bottles are a safe source of water and is guaranteed safety.
1800	Water is relatively less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
1801	Water in developing countries is less likely to be in the public water supply. Thus, many programs regularly distribute bottled water to users. Distributing large bottles of water is much easier than distributing large quantities of water from a large bulk storage vessel. Also, contamination from large bulk storages of water is much more likely than from single bottles of water.
1802	Another good reason to buy bottled water is that it is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. Many government programs regularly disperse bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water. Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
1803	It is true that bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries, where public water is least safe to drink. But bottled water is also probably considerably more cost effective than distributing public water. For example, buying 30 to 60 gallons of water is easier and much more cost effective than buying 10 or 20 gallons at the water fountain every time. And in developing countries water quality problems in public water distribution can be worse than in developed countries.
1804	Taking into account that bottled water is somewhat less likely to be found in developing countries where public water is least safe to drink, many government programs regularly distribute bottled water for various reasons. Distributing small bottles of water is much easier than distributing large bulk storages of water, Also contamination from large water storage containers is much more likely than from single 12-20 ounce bottles of water.
1805	One can use bottled water until there is clean water source available, but it is true that bottles can be reused!
1806	It is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused.
1807	Unless used, water bottles can be reused.
1808	It is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottled water can be reused!
1809	It is true that bottled water is a waste. However, plastic bottles can be reused.
1810	If there was no bottled water, people would drink sweetened drinks because it would be the only portable drinks. People would become fat.
1811	If bottled water did not exist and the only portable drink was sweetened liquor, more people would be drinking sweetened liquids as it would be the only portable drinks! People would become fat.
1812	If bottled water did not exist, more people would be drinking sweetened liquids instead. People would become more fat instead.
1813	If bottled water did not exist, it would have been easier to control sugar intake. More people would have been drinking other drinks, and it would have led to people becoming obese.
1814	If bottled water did not exist, people would be drinking sweetened liquids because it would be the only portable drinks. People would become fat.
1815	Two men/women together does not seem natural, although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?
1816	What is in front of God is not important. There are many reasons to make a family together. Marriage is a way of life. What has taken place in the last few years is a new marriage that goes beyond God. There have been more than enough actions to justify changing the name of God.
1817	Looking at it from a perspective, two men/women together is not a natural thing. And although we know that the world is changing and we are getting new ideas, the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce. Marriage is in front of God and the words come from the Bible, but I think it's obviously that God doesn't approve of this. So it doesn't seem ironic that God never realized this?
1818	Two men/women together does not seem natural to me. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas, the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible, but God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?
1819	Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas about sex, the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?
1820	For anyone who tries to follow these threads of arguments and rebuttals, I wish that the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
1821	For those who try to follow these arguments and rebuttals, it looks like Chasbas' argument which I rebutted on Feb 07, 2007 07:09 has been deleted, presumably by Chasbas. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.
1822	Chasbas was responding to me rather than deleting it and I suppose he deleted it himself. I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.

1825	Girls AND Boys were made for a reason. This reason is not so they can pair up with the same sex. It is so that they can pair up with opposite genders. Opposites Attract, Every where, wether its in magnets, electricity, atoms, or humans. Besides, it just doesnt work with two guys (genitals), thats why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.. Girl AND Boy!

Besides, it just doesn't work with two guys (genitals), thats why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.. Guy AND Girl!
1829	It should not be correct and agreed that Guys and Girls were made for the same thing, unless you believe in Uniqueness of Humans. Otherwise it is just untrue, especially for those guys with out interests and strong emotions for those special girl beings. Guys can be GUY in many ways, so it doesnt matter what nature has come up with if they dont want it!
1830	Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly, nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their own beliefs.
1831	Why don't we simply get rid of all incentives to be married, politically or not? No tax benefits, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out of the loop completely. If a particular religion wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that's going against their religion. I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks, tax incentives or other benefits to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to be Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.

1835	Its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex. However, other plants do it as well.
1836	It is natural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
1837	It is sex for sex. Most of the time it's between opposite sexes and it is natural.
1838	It's just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
1839	It's just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with their opposite sex.
1840	Potential means something outside of our control. Right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict. It just doesn't work. To "lead" a country must have time and resources to worry about other countries and not itself.
1841	The potential of this would be huge, but right now there is much religious tension between Muslims and Hindus. So, the leadership of a nation would have to spend a lot of time and resources to avoid another war inside it's own country. There are enough things we have to worry about like terrorism etc., without the peace and harmony that is required for real power.
1842	Indeed, any representative of a former great nation except for its capitol, wouldn't have a chance. Especially since their capitals would be in big old piles of rubble.
1843	Of course, it has the potential, but right now the current religious tension between Muslims and Hindus would probably prevent this. I can't think of a leading nation that has had large scale internal conflict, it just doesn't work. To "lead" a country must have time and resources to worry about other countries and not itself.
1844	There isn't any internal conflict in a leading country because a leading nation can handle all the problems in a country.
1845	India and China could redefine what third world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
1846	India and China could define what third world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
1847	You have to change how you view these things because India and China both are already first world countries and in the future both will be both first and third world countries simultaneously.
1848	India and China are redefine what a 3rd World country means because in the future both will be First and 3rd World countries simultaneously.
1849	If India and China could redefine what third world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously, then India and China would represent what we have now: first and third world countries.
1850	It is a controversial belief that we cannot know if there is a higher force. Christianity is not that. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With Atheism, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
1851	As human beings, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity, however, is not it. Firstly, because it is not one belief that every Christian shares. It lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. In Buddhist faith, because it speaks of the One true God, unity, good, peace, love, and so on.
1852	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however does not have this concept. It lacks solidarity. It is different for every religion. I compare it to a road with different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With atheism, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
1853	Christianity is more scientific than atheism because religion is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With atheism, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
1854	In Christianity, the concept is pretty clear. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. Secondly, I see the point with your comparison, and I agree that atheism is more scientific.
1855	This is my biggest problem with Christianity is, why is it about belief? There have been horrible people who are believers. What about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is? I AM an atheist, and I'm a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, it's madness!!
1856	This is my big problem with Christianity. Why is it about belief? There have been horrible people who are believers.

The idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is beyond preposterous, it's madness!!

1860	This debate presents a false dichotomy. It's one of not being christian or atheist. When we think about religion, it should be theism, pantheism, omnivory and eclecticism.
1861	Christian or Atheism? This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are theistic or atheistic. Why not "Nothing or This or That?" Theism is not God, rather, it is the positive view that humans can be positively able to use the powers of God to accomplish good.
1862	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are "Christian or Atheist". Why shouldn’t it be "Theism or Atheism or Other"?
1863	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which the only options are Christianity or atheism. Shouldn't it be "Theism or Atheism or Other"?
1864	This debate presents a false dichotomy in which only one option is the answer. All religions are equal and should be treated with respect.
1865	Kids sometimes need punishment to learn to behave. Stop being that much nosy, stop talking to strangers. Just don't work at all for a while.
1866	No one needs to be told that they cannot do something because it annoys others. Sometimes that's what a kid needs to know that if they do something wrong, they should stop.
1867	It can be a difficult task to teach kids not to hit others, especially when adults too often ignore the need to educate and discipline their own children.
1868	Sometimes that's what a child needs to behave all those nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
1869	Stop pressuring a child and considering it an impossibility when children sometimes need encouragement.
1870	Children who grow up from wrong behaviours will eventually pay for their actions and learn from their actions.
1871	They must understand that their actions lead to consequences. From that they will learn to not do it again.
1872	I agree that teachers should stop using corporal punishment and punishment. Even though it may cause long term psychological effects on the child, the child who has been punished may not feel safe with their teachers anymore.
1873	They need to understand that their actions would receive consequences. From that, they can learn to not do such things again.
1874	Teachers should be punished for letting students stay after school. They should be fired even if they don't have pets, they should be punished so that others can learn a lesson for a day. They should be angry and upset. That would teach all students to never stay after school and never go home so late.
1875	Atheism is not based on science but on the soul. An atheist always seeks the absence of God but a religious person just believes. Atheism needs to be constantly fed but faith is not required. Though I'm a religious person, I think an atheist can stand to hear because everyone is independent and everyone has to have their own opinion.
1876	Although atheism is based on science, faith is based on the soul. A religious person is always looking for the absence of God, but an atheist just believes. It is necessary to continually feed atheism so that it won't die out.
1877	Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith should not be as it is a moral system based on something difficult to explain. Therefore, it is not the best option.
1878	Religion should be constantly fed with new information to counter the false information. Atheism is only about the concept of God, but faith is a warm feeling. Although I'm a religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear everyone is independent and everyone has to have his own opinion.
1879	God Is in everyone's heart. No matter what is stated in the scriptures, everyone is being appointed by God to carry out his duties.
1880	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline their children. It only makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
1881	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get angry than to see what they did wrong.
1882	Parenting is hard, you need to trust your child and let them make mistakes. Spanking doesn't work well as an option to discipline a child. It makes the child mad. The child should see what they did wrong without being spanked and
1883	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it. It just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
1884	Spanking is a physically abusive method of disciplining children that doesn’t help them learn and which can make them angrier rather than calmer.
1885	It can make them think hitting their kids is okay, but it is not alright to hit them.
1886	No, because hitting your child could make them think it's alright and is not harmful. Also, it could scar them mentally, and could also make them hate their children.
1887	No, hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. Also, it can make them think hitting their kids is OK.
1888	We can't sit and ignore laws like this that are harmful to children. It's wrong to hit your child, even though it doesn't physically hurt them it would have a negative affect on their future and how they see the world.
1889	It can cause significant harm to mentally scar them for life. Also, it can make them think hitting their children is alright.
1890	Whether it was a defense or a rage, I would turn him in if he was accused of an act of rage. If he was accused of a defense, the chances are he would get off lightly. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that a family is mourning because of his actions.
1891	Regarding the murder charges against Orlando, Florida, police officer Daniel Pantaleo, there would be a lot more turmoil if somebody murdered a police officer. There would be outrage and people would be angry. But in this case there is not that anger and there is no outrage. People are with the officer. Well, at least for now, there is still hope. When my daddy in law wanted to get rid of our dog he made me bury it myself. I did not want to do it but I had to make him do it. I will never get over it, but I also do not mind. The 69. [I]n these elections many misunderstandings were between Mr Obama and Mr. McCain. The former wanted to be president of the United States and the latter would not allow
1892	They would most likely get away with it if it was self-defense. But if it was rage, my conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there is a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.
1893	If it was self-defense, they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.
1894	If they were driving at a excessive rate of speed and it were self-defense I would be happy to forgive the offense because it could not have been for the sake of happiness. However, if it was a rageful act, I would be mad and furious and I would not forgive them at all.
1895	There are a lot of casese that you and me put things on the spur of the moment which can turn out to be bad for me. When it comes to meeting spouse you have to evaluate the person and understand whether they are suitable or not.
1896	If my spouse murdered your spouse I would turn him/her in. Weather it was an accident or on purpose. If it was an accident then the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life there is more to worry about than yourself.
1897	In point of view, whether it was an accident or an intentionally murder. We as human beings should always remain vigilant to prevent wrong doings.
1898	If my spouse killed your spouse, I'd want to know who did it. But sometimes in life, there are more things to worry about than yourself.
1899	If my spouse committed murder, I'd turn him/her in. Although, if it was an accident then the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse killed your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would want to know, I wouldn't allow myself to rest until I knew. Sometimes, there's more to worry about than oneself
1900	I put my argument on the side saying "probably", because I am not entirely sure. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
1901	In my opinion, it really depends. If my husband kills someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die. But if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
1902	I put my argument on the side saying "yes but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die but if he just killed someone for no reason, I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
1903	If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than him die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
1904	I put my argument on the side saying YES, but in reality it really depends on my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die. But if he just killed someone for no reason, I'd probably turn him in because love may be strong, but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
1905	When I say women can and can't do with their bodies I don't mean how many kids they have or whatever else a person can do with their body, I mean the legal rights they have to do with it. For example, if a person has an abortion and gets it legally they don't have to go to prison or anything because their life is not at risk. You are not committing suicide when you take a pill, and if a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute. The government doesn't tell women what to do with
1906	Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies. It's illegal to commit suicide if a person is caught trying to hack themselves to pieces they could be placed in a mental institute so the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body.
1907	It's illegal to commit suicide if a person is caught, they're placed in a mental institute. So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body.
1908	Government does not, or should not, tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body. If someone was caught trying to hack himself to pieces, he or she could be placed in a mental institute. So, yes, the government limits what a woman can do with her body.
1909	Now you aren't telling a woman what she can and can't do with her body. It's illegal to commit suicide and if a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute.
1910	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When rape occurs, why is it the poor, defenseless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about
1911	Women have become selfish when it comes to giving birth. They believe that they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are children’s lives we are talking about.
1912	No matter what circumstance a woman is in, she got herself pregnant. When rape occurs, why is it the poor, defenceless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasn’t the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? Women have become selfish, where their bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about
1913	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! Women are free to get pregnant any time they want, when rape occurs. The baby that is born after the rape is innocent. Yes, she wasn't the mothers' fault but why should the innocent child have to die? These are childrens lives we are talking about.
1914	No matter what circumstance a woman is in she got herself pregnant. When rape occurs, why is it the poor, defenseless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? Women have become selfish where their bodies are concerned, they believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about.
1915	What we are dealing with is "indirect murder" if a woman decides to abort a child that she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
1916	What we are dealing with is indirect murder if a woman decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society.
1917	If a woman decides to abort a child, it is indirect murder, because she's killing a life that might have been a big contribution to society.
1918	Indirect murder when a woman who just has a baby decides to abort it, she's directly killing the life that could have contributed to society.
1919	It is the mother's decision to abort or not to abort the child she just had. It is indirect murder if she makes that choice.
1920	While yes physical education classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory (especially not all 4 years of HS). Maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. In lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That's All.
1921	Phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools, but not mandatory. Maybe that one year should be mandatory. For children in grades 1-4, I think it's mandatory. Little kids have much more to gain or lose in weird ways. That's all.
1922	In lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That is all.
1923	If PE classes are only in high school, they should not be mandatory (especially not all four years of high school). Maybe only having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. In lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That's all.
1924	While physical education classes should be mandatory in high school, they shouldnt be mandatory all four years of high school. Maybe just have PE be an optional class that students take and give them the option of PE classes year by year. In lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain or lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
1925	Expensive, embarrassing for some, unfair for AP students that aren't in varsity sports.
1926	Expensive for some, embarrassing for students not in varsity sports because varsity athletes can waive the class.
1927	Various expensive and embarrassing policies can only be implemented if the school is in the middle of the school system and not far from an elite school.
1928	Anchormen and women in girls sport have a better chance of getting in (sic) varsity sports than AP students.
1929	Not too many people are willing to start early enough to save a lot of money on tuition. For those who are in varsity sports, they can just waive their classes.
1930	How can anyone say that gay marriage is wrong? It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs, so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
1931	How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is wrong? It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs. So who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
1932	How can anyone say that gay marriage is wrong? It's a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs and who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
1933	How can anyone say that gay marriage is wrong. It's a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
1934	How can anyone say that gay marriage is wrong? It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs. So who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?
1935	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of two people who love and care about each other. Some straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if two people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e. Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
1936	The purpose of marriage is to provide security and stability to the family, irrespective of the gender or sexual preference of the couple.
1937	Think about the recent events in the South where some gay men have been accused of raping some black children and because there was one gay man who has died after committing a murder, the whole country decided to stop letting gay men get married. This was hugely unpopular with Christians and they refused to allow gay marriages. Also, marriage is for the benefit of getting kids as we are living in a developing society. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap it's benefits? I.e have kids? 
1938	My religion does not conflict with this matter because I'm an agnostic. I am an ardent supporter of gay rights. As the saying goes, marriage is a legal contract between 2 people who love and care about each other. Some straight couples just get married for the benefit of having kids. So, is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e. have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is fine.
1939	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter.

1940	 Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1941	The idea of "common good" is good, but first you have to have the means to do so.
1942	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride, but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other, but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However, for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1943	It would also be good to have personal pursuit before you can help others for the common good. However, for some people, their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1944	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but one first has to have personal pursuit before he can help others for the common good. However, for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
1945	There is no provision in either document that says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom. Now, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan. We also applied our tax money to construction projects for the common good. We also had courts to help protect our rights. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, we were not opposed to taxation. We never have been. You have a pretty limited view of humanity and our responsibility to create a just society. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.

1947	There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is part of our freedom. Now, our founding fathers were involved in government before they were involved in rebellion. In Virginia, our house of burgesses provided money every year to every widow and orphan.

1948	In point of view, our founding fathers were involved in colony govts before they were involved in rebellion. When we had our revolution, we were opposed to taxation WITHOUT representation, and we never have been opposed to taxation.  We never have been the most powerful portion of the American society after a revolution. Plus, you seem to be basing it on parts of our founding documents which don't exist.
1949	There is no provision in either document you cite which says keeping all the fruits of our earnings is a part of freedom. There is also no provision in either document which says that we should just because they make up about 2% of the people in the state. We also cannot do that as there are many good law professors that make up some good law schools. Yet there are bad law professors that make up some bad law schools. So we need to be representative of the majority of the people that we serve. If there are good law professors that make up a bad law school, the court of public opinion will figure that out eventually and the bad professor will be forced out. Also, we cannot offer our property as collateral because the only way you can collateralize anything is when you own your own stuff. The lawyer's company has absolutely nothing to offer because they are out of business. We need to be representative of the majority of the people that we serve. If there are good lawyers that make up a bad law school, the court of public opinion will figure that out eventually and the bad professor will be forced out. Also, we cannot own our own stuff because no one will trust us as everyone in the history of the world has been ruled by priests, kings, or dictators.
1950	It sounds like you have a major problem. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and makes determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.) they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
1951	It sounds to me that you have huge trouble. CASA is a system that is staffed by Registered Nurses and make determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.) they are bound by law to make a report. If there is nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Being bureaucrats they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
1952	If CASA determines that you have an abuse case and decides that your child's medicaid benefits should be terminated then you need to appeal this action and ask for reconsideration.
1953	If there is suspicion, then the government would have to look into it. CASA is staffed with registered nurses that makes medicaid determinations. If you took your child to a doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse (bruises, etc.) they are bound by law to make a report. If there is nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade.  Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
1954	It sounds to me like you have a big problem. CASA is staffed by Registered Nurses who make determinations about Medicaid eligibility.

If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicaid.  Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to stick their noses into everyone's business.
1955	Officially, they state that they make an 'orderly market'. They must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. So they are forced to buy and sell under certain conditions. It's also true that they make full use of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I don't agree with them or with this policy but that's what is happening.
1956	Officially they argue that they need to make an 'orderly market'. They need to buy and sell goods and services in order to avoid too drastic or sudden shifts in the markets.   It is also true that they fully take advantage of buying and selling when they can make money.   It's an unpleasant trade-off.   I don't agree with them or with this policy but that's what is happening.
1957	The official reason for requiring this trade is that it makes an 'orderly market'. They have to buy and sell because the market may suddenly and dramatically change. So they are forced to buy and sell when they can make money. It's also true that they make full use of buying and selling opportunities when they can make money. It's an unpleasant trade-off. I don't agree with it or the policy that it is applied to but that's what is happening.
1958	There are many different reasons for regulations, including... to make a market... make full use of opportunities to buy and sell... unpleasant trade-off... agreed to by... a rationale for.
1959	The official reason they give is that they make a 'good market'.  They must buy and sell to keep the market from sudden and dramatic shifts. So they are forced to buy and sell under certain conditions.   It is also true that they take full advantage of opportunities to buy and sell when they can make money.   It's an unpleasant trade-off.   I don't agree with them or this policy but that's what is happening.
1960	There should be no argument in this really because the two women in this case have different issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court against you. The new wife is going to court against her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, would be if the ex-wife and you both had the same lawyer. Obviously that cannot work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex-girlfriend with the new one, because then she would be probably named in the divorce case.
1961	Yes, the two women have separate issues. They have a public split and each must face her own legal problems. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband.  This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
1962	Yes, the two women have separate issues that are going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict that there would be, would be if the two women had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone to look out for your interests and she needs someone to look out for her own. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new wife would probably be named in the divorce case.
1963	Well, I could tell my ex that there is a new woman in her life, but that may not be as positive to her as telling her that you were cheating on her. I could also tell her that you were cheating on her, so you need to leave the house, so a lawyer can't help you out.
1964	This is completely legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you and the new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest, and she needs someone looking out for hers.

1965	The intelligence community exposed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent, and her life and possibly the security of the country was put in jeopardy. Hillary Clinton's infidelity only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and was no skin off the nose of anyone else. One of the reasons why the media did not devote as much attention to Plamegate was because corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
1966	Plamegate was far worse than the CIA Leak. When Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed, her life, and possibly the security of our country, was put in jeopardy. Clinton's infidelity only directly affected Hillary and Chelsea, and was no skin off the noses of everyone else. One reason why the media devoted less attention to Plamegate is because corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.
1967	The CIA leak was far worse when Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent was revealed. Her life, and possibly the security of our country was put in jeopardy.   One reason why the media devoted less attention to Plamegate is because corporations who own the media are major Republican donors.

1970	I agree that a woman should have the right to chose and there are lots of children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal then there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think that when a person says they are pro life, that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didnt want or couldnt take care of these children.
1971	Women should have the right to choose. There are lots of children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives. I support choice. I also think that if it is made illegal then there are going to be a lot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think that when someone says they are pro life that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that were abandoned from the mothers that did not want or could not take care of these children.
1972	Women should have the right to choose and there are lots of children that need to go through foster homes, and live hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if this becomes illegal there will be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I think when someone says that they are pro life they aren't looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didn't want or couldn't take care of these children.
1973	It is not always easy to differentiate between true believers and a religious fanatic like certain members of the body politic who are focused on their own political agendas and taking decisions that may hurt the average citizen in the end. So, you have to go with your gut. If you believe in the integrity of the people in the government than go with your gut. But if you think they are going to be bought with money, scandals or anything else...then go with your gut.
1974	When you say that you are pro life, ask yourself if you want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didn't want or couldn't take care of these children.
1975	This is basically where the US was in the 1970's/80's.  The government was very interventionistic and there was little privacy for anyone.  Not only were the privacy laws deemed unconstitutional, but the government also enforced them.  With the SSNs, some businesses are being forced to hand over information to the government when they charge a fee for something.  With all the craziness that was going on in the government, this is becoming increasingly likely.
1976	It is not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  The government has the right to know what the government is doing-- because it is with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us. Anyone arguing that the fourth amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The fourth amendment has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search and seizure, tapping phone lines, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
1977	Ethically speaking, it’s not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person. It’s stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing— because it’s with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.  Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a "probable cause", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left.
1978	Explaining that it's not okay to invade the privacy of an innocent person is a waste of energy and potentially dangerous. And if you do violate someone's privacy, then it is only proper if you have a "probable cause" to search the premises or if you have a search warrant.  For one of the the Fourth Amendment is effectively nullified by passwords (passwords must be 3+ numbers or symbols) and requiring full name or passport number from you whenever you shop or use the Internet.  A computer with full encryption and security is the only way that you will be able to avoid letting the government look at your computer and having your ID sought for you all the time.

1980	China is oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Instances may have tailed off over recent years, but beatings and torture are still a regular part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China. Even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
1981	This man has a point. I don't know specifics of any yahoo involvement, but I do know for certain that the Chinese government is very oppressive to anyone who questions its motives or policies. Beats and torture are still a part of protocol there. America simply chooses to ignore this because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China, even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
1982	Using beating as an example, the Chinese are imprisoned because their opinions are too radical or their language is deemed too esoteric. We simply choose to ignore it because we're more concerned with preserving our good economic relations with China even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
1983	China is a very oppressive place. There are many instances that over the past decade have tailed off a lot. But beatings and torture still exist there. America simply chooses to ignore it because they're worried about preserving the good economic relations with China even though a lot of the cheap labor we outsource there is indeed done by slaves. We really should wake up and start seeing the truth.
1984	Killing the illegals and turning them into slaves is something our government is involved with. It is morally wrong to export/import slaves or illegal aliens from one country to another.
1985	If you were strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then you should sue for compensation. Money won't change what those evil bastards put you through.....but if you can get something out of what you have been through other than anger and bitterness, then why not. Hope it all goes your way. You deserve it, your family deserve it.
1986	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then you should sue for compensation. Money won't change what those evil bastards put you through...but if you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness, then why not. Hope it all goes your way. You deserve it, your family deserve it.
1987	The award for the best line, verbally or visually, is for the statement written on a sheet of paper or on a piece of thread tied around the neck of an innocent creature and wrapped around its own neck in true horror, She was originally pregnant by the string and torn in half.
1988	If you are strong enough to relive the worst moments of your life again, then i say you should sue for compensation. Money won't change what those evil bastards put you through... but if you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness, then why not. Hope it all goes your way. You deserve it, your family deserve it.
1989	if you can get something out of the crap you have been through other than anger and bitterness,then why not. Hope it all goes your way. You deserve it, your family deserve it.
1990	Probably not. Not many people work for free unless there is a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc). You MIGHT get someone to take the case on fee, which is to say they'd get a percentage of the verdict. This will only work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent many years (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to get my training; I don't generally give work out for free unless there's a damn good reason. And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
1991	Probaly not.  Not many people work for free unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc).  You MIGHT get someone to take your case for fee, which is to say they'd get a %age of the verdict.  This will work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount.  Otherwise, prepare to pay. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training; I don't generally give work out for free unless there's a damn good reason.  And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
1992	Being poor is one reason you don't get work for free. Besides that, there are only a few other things that get people to volunteer to work for free.  The most important is that the work is easy and when it is, the volunteer's paying expenses don't affect what they get paid.
1993	Probably not. Not many people work for free, unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc). You MIGHT get someone to take the case on fee, which is to say they'd get a %age of the verdict.  This will only work if 1) you have a good case and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay.

And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
1994	Most people don't work for free unless there's a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you're protesting discrimination, etc).  You MAY get someone to take the case on fee, which is to say they'd get a %age of the verdict.  This will only work if 1) you have a good case, and 2) your case has a high potential settlement amount. Otherwise, prepare to pay.

And no, "I don't want to pay" is not a good reason.
1995	There is no opposition between what we say vs what we say in private.
1996	By having experienced public speakers and speakers that know how to listen, you don't have to wing anything, since they are experts in both.
1997	If you really want to hear how a person speaks, debates are a good place to start, since even though they have official “answers” to expected questions, they do have to be on their toes a bit more than when they give an address.
1998	One thing I have noticed is that his inability to be an effective public speaker. You would think he has the best speech writers money could buy. Problem is..I don't think he uses them. I almost think he just wings the whole damn thing, but who knows. He can't be a good public speaker, because he doesn't have an impressive enough vocabulary to paint a clear picture. If he wanted to be a good public speaker, he would need to enrich his vocabulary.
1999	There are a couple speech writers that have been hired to write speeches for President Bush and it is not the person that has the right answers but he is good at saying what to say.  Try to hear how he speaks and debates if you think he is not so articulate and what he said might be taken upside down.
2000	The Constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit of happiness". That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent - why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?
2001	First of all, the Constitution does not guarantee a "pursuit of happiness". That phrase appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. On substance, I doubt very much that time and effort are spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for, say, 15 year olds but not 16 year olds?

2002	In the first place, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the "pursuit (or pursuit) of happiness".  That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.

2003	First of all, the constitution does not guarantee the "pursuit" (or the pursuit) of happiness. This idea appears in the preamble to the declaration of independence. On substance, I doubt very much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution in relation to other offenses. Finally, will you admit to any role for morality in criminal law? For example, take laws relating to age of consent -- why is consensual sex illegal for 15 year olds but not 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?
2004	First of all, the Constitution does NOT guarantee the "pursuit (or pursuit) of happiness".  That expression appears in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence.

2005	Well, the difference between the two, more importantly for the question is whether they are legal or not in the same manner as a bunch of other things, but more importantly, because only top tier politicians or top tier lawyers could come up with it. They could make prostitution legal, they choose not to, they could make porn illegal they choose not to. It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says is the difference. The bottom line is they could make prostitution legal, they choose not to, they could make porn illegal they choose not to. It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says is the difference.
2006	Deep, dark, and troubling truth is that the legal definition of prostitution and pornography are illogical and cannot be universally applied.
2007	The difference between the two is more like dolphins and porpoises not lions and bats. The reason one is legal and the other is not is because the law says one is legal and the other is not. The actual difference between the two acts are hard to see. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have sex with another person for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with.

2008	There is a difference between prostitution and porn. Prostitution is illegal, but pornography is legal if it is commercial.
2009	It is one of those cases where the difference is only what the court says. Great question.
2010	Actually you have it wrong.  The justice system developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind in all of history so far.  It is far from perfect.  It is flawed.  It is human.  It is still the best we have come up with so far.  No matter what media may claim and promote, it is getting better all the time, not worse.  Because people do better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our children.

2012	Media claims and promotes the justice system that evolved in the United States as the best that has developed in mankind in all of history so far. However, it is not perfect, it is flawed, it is human, and it is still the best system that has come up with so far. No matter what media may claim and promote, it is getting better all the time, not worse. Because people do better and want better, we will become better for ourselves and our children.
2013	Acting on the principles of equality and justice, the U.S. society has already implemented its own justice system, very similar to the justice system of Ancient Greece and Rome. Nevertheless, the U.S. justice system is not perfect. Its principles and rules have great weaknesses, flaws and mistakes. Despite that, it has tremendously improved over the last 200 years. The justice system of the United States is the best that has developed in all of mankind for more than 200 years.
2014	Actually, the justice system has developed and practiced in the United States is the best that has developed in mankind, in all of history so far.

2016	You might be able to. Here's what I would do.  1. Gather all your receipts.  If you don't have the actual receipts, well, your screwed and might as well stop here.  However, there is the possiblity that the old pharmacy has your perscriptions on file and they may be able to provide you with a print out of your purchases. 2.

2020	People don't know all the details of your case and it would take a lawyer a good amount of time to prepare a defense for you. It's not a good situation to find counsel to support you on this difficult problem.  Y!A can't support you on the reasoning of your case since no one here knows all the details.
2021	You shouldn't expect a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case.  It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details.  This is one of those situations where Y!A really isn't going to be especially beneficial for you.
2022	Nobody here knows all the details of your case.  It would take an attorney no small amount of time to prepare a defense for you, and nobody here is going to be able to offer you real help without knowing all the details. This is one of those situations where Y!A really isn't going to be especially beneficial for you.
2023	You don't have to be here in this chat (and you shouldn't have to be) to receive good legal advice. The attorney will have no trouble getting real information about your case without being right here in this chat room.  In other cases, it's very possible that I would be able to offer real help, even though you wouldn't know me.
2024	You shouldn't expect to get a realistic answer from anyone here because no one here (except you, perhaps), knows all the details of your case.

2025	If you can't do the time, then don't do the crime. 
2026	Three strikes equals life in California.  Live with it!  You've been warned so don't ask for sympathy because it's "just a little pot".  It's not like the third strike was for pot only.  He / She committed other crimes, but didn't get caught.  We are safer as Californians without them on the street.  You know what they say... "If you can't do the time then don't do the crime."
2027	If it is just a little pot, just go to jail and do time, not commit other crimes.
2028	Three strikes is just barely enough to get you in trouble.  You can live with it.  You should have been warned not to ask for sympathy because it's "just a little pot". It's not like the third strike was for pot only.  He/She has committed other crimes that are not as serious. We as Californians are safer without them on the street.  You know what they say... "If you can't do the time then don't do the crime.
2029	Seven strikes means serving life sentence.  You've been warned.  Don't ask for sympathy because it's "just a little pot".  It's not like the third strike was for pot only. He or she committed other crimes, but didn't get caught.  We as Californians are safer without them on the streets.  You know what they say... "If you can't do the time then don't do the crime"
2030	For a woman, if she's married with a man who isn't her husband but still the legal father, then they're legally bound.  The father has every right to demand that the baby's name be used, if anything else is put in the birth certificate.
2031	Yes, if the father was there, he has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in.  Why assume that he left.  She didn't say that in her question, she only said they were separated.  Maybe the mother is the one who left!
2032	Yes, if it's his baby they were married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. How can a baby give birth to itself? Also, it can only do so when conceived artificially or surgically.  {Considering this, it seems reasonable that whoever attempts to give birth to an embryo is stealing the child. What law would allow such an individual to enjoy the fruits of such adultery? How can a baby give birth to itself? can become a second father, should he also receive the infancy of the father?  If so, it seems reasonable that whoever attempts to give birth to an embryo is stealing the child. How can a baby give birth to itself?  Considering
2033	Yes, if it's her baby. They are legally bound to each other. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else is put in. Why assume that the man left? She didn't say she was. Maybe the mother left!
2034	Yes, if it is his baby, they're married and although they may be separated, they're still legally bound. The father has every right to demand that the baby be given his last name and if I were him, I would refuse to sign the birth certificate if anything else was put in. Why assume that the man left? She didn't say that in her question. She only said they were separated. Maybe the mother is the one who left!
2035	All right, wait...you signed a contract knowing you were not going to abide by it.  The answer is yes.  They can place restrictions in the lease and depending upon how the lease is drafted, the key to this restriction is the word "loaded".  Meaning you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speedloader nearby- It will be hard to prove either way.
2036	To take your gun (black, blue, silver, brown, shiny, functional, and anything else) in a public place, put it on a gun rack or keep it unloaded - A load carried gun may be a most serious charge. There is little way to prove it without encountering an actual loaded gun and likely or probable cause. So that generally makes private places where guns are not loaded a better choice.  For example, some stores, apartment buildings, family homes have corner gun racks or "lockers" under bed frames.
2037	It can happen if the lease doesn't state anything and they say yes and yes when they shouldn't have.  It also can happen if the lease states anything and they say no and yes when they shouldn't have.  Yes you can keep a loaded gun nearby.
2038	There are many ways to dispose of weapons. Some are legal, but many are illegal and in addition, some weapons cannot be disposed of. To avoid legal issues with your firearm, consider the following: {After a shooting incident,  learn from your mistakes and try to prevent future incidents by eradicating your access to guns in the immediate following events: A shooting, explosion, or any other tragedy.  Learn from the error and don't get another chance to do so!  Get rid of firearms and you will avoid wrongful conviction or death, misconduct of family members and their actual or potential consequences,  public reprimand, loss of gun rights,  costly court costs, stigma, or physical harm to you or to others. Don't wait and get rid of your guns.   Forward this warning to your friends and to the next law-abiding citizen.  There is
2039	yes, you signed a contract knowing that you would not obey the law, but they can still place restrictions on the lease to make this line of defense nearly impossible to prove.
2040	It is best that you not re-open such a case. The best you can do is go after your lawyer. However, it probably won't help a whole lot. The most important thing to learn is that you were young when it happened. Your body had many changes to go through yet and with Firestone's record, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
2041	Not going to the court can be a very valuable lesson, it's not that hard. They found a way to dismiss your case and ignore all the evidence. You've got the plaintiff, you're young and unknowing, there's no excuse for your death. It's a legality you should have learned from the past: don't try to get justice in the legal system, even though it might save you in the end.
2042	Unfortunately, you cannot reopen such a case. The best you can do is go after your lawyer, but it probably won't help a whole lot. As important as it is to learn from such a gruesome crime, it is worth nothing that you were too young when it happened- your body had many changes to go through that could affect your future. And with Firestone's record in such cases, you should have had a clause put in the settlement (or not settled at all) that future consequences of the accident could be claimed.
2043	Unfortunately, you cannot reopen the case because not enough evidence has been proven. The best you can do is try to get a bad lawyer in and they should only press up on the settlement so they don't get sued again for negligence. Very valuable lesson is to be learned here:You were so young, and your body was in so many changes, and you did not have a clause in the settlement for future effects of the accident.
2044	Eventually, thanks to the lawsuits filed in this case, we can actually go after the doctors, lawyers, and insurance companies that caused our client’s injuries. This is not something that would be a big change in your life, but it is a very useful lesson.
2045	If you do it in good faith, it's fine. If you do it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language-- and it was your only reason in coming up with a new language in the first place -- then it won't help you and you will be convicted of making "terroristic threats."
2046	If you do it in good faith it is fine, however if you are doing it to protest against your country of birth (not because of any reasons other than because it is a poor country), then you should use an alternate method.
2047	If you do it in good faith it is fine. However, if you are doing it in order to yell "I have a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you were speaking in your new language -- and it was your only real purpose in coming up with a new language in the first place -- then it won't help you, and you will be convicted of "making terroristic threats".
2048	If you do it in good faith it is fine. If you were speaking in another language as a result of searching for work, it would be OK. However, if you are doing it to make terroristic threats, then it will not help you.
2049	If you do it in GOOD FAITH it is fine. However, if you are doing it in the purpose of yelling "I'm having a bomb!" in public places and then justify it by saying you are speaking in your new language and you are the ONLY person coming up with a new language in the FIRST PLACE. Then it will not help you and you will be convicted of "making terroristic threats.
2050	It shouldn't be deemed as hearsay and thrown out immediately. It's inadmissible evidence. They can't accept this as a confession, because first, his low IQ made him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered, and the wording and thought process are too complex for this defendant. He is too incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
2051	The police can't take it as a confession because his low IQ made him easily susceptible to coercion. He was coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered. The wording and thought process are too complex for this defendant to think of in any sort of logical progression. He is too incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
2052	Declaring the talk at trial inadmissible will not have the desired effect. The defendant's testimony may be taken into consideration with that of other evidence to make a better decision.
2053	To create validity in this case, you must have a direct account of someone saying this to him. This man has no such account. Therefore, the plaintiff has no viable legal case.
2054	This confession was coerced because he had low intelligence. He was easily coerced into confessing. Second, there is no proof he spoke the words he is said to have uttered and the wording and thought process are to complex for this defendant. He is to incompetent to be able to think of problems in logical progressions.
2055	Well, since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it.  There is no way to get her name off the loan.  The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck.  And no, he won't get off scott free either.  They can take his tax return to pay on it.  She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.
2056	If she signs for the student loan then legally she can be held responsible for it.  There is no way to get her name off the loan.  The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck.  And no, he won't get off scot-free either.  They can take his tax return to pay on it.  She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.  I would urge her to call the loan company and find out the status of the loan.  I can tell you this, none of these things will happen until it goes into default.
2057	Undecided about paying off a student loan via bankruptcy? Then contact your loan company and learn how it will affect you.
2058	To the dude below:  Student loans can not be discharged through bankruptcy anymore.  They will go after him first, because he is the primary borrower.  If they can't collect from him, then they will go after her for the money.  As far as I am aware, the mortgage will follow him.  They will claim to be foregone creditors and argue that the mortgage is more important than the loan.  Well, neither one is.  She can still take them to court for the money.   To the cheerleader below:  Don't worry about it.  We can't pay off the debt if we don't keep making the payments.
2059	Since she signed for it, legally she can be held responsible for it.  There is no way to get her name off the loan.  The only way that she can try to get it off, is by disputing the signature on the promissory note, otherwise she's stuck.  And no, he won't get off scott free either.  They can take his tax return to pay on it.  She needs to chalk it up to a lesson learned.   To the dude below me:  Student loans can not be discharged thru bankruptcy anymore.  They will go after him first, because he is the primary borrower.  If they can't collect from him, then they will go after her for the money.  Like I said in my source, I work in a student loan company.  I would urge her to call the loan company and find out the staus of the loan.  I can tell you this, none of these things will happen until it goes into default.
2060	There's no doubt that rape and incest do create death and suffering, though it would be hard to say if either contributes to less murder or suicide. But the feminists' collective whining that 'Margaret Sanger wrote about wanting less minority babies', does a disservice to the millions of people, both men and women, who have their lives ruined by the sex-obsessed women. Who the hell has read Sanger before now?
2061	Because in order to deflect from the fact that most women are killing their babies, they have to do a lot of scaremongering so that women will think it's safer and more pleasant to kill the baby than to suffer its birth.
2062	I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority babies.
2063	Because in order to deflect from the fact that most women are killing their babies because they're 'unwanted' they have to do a lot of scaremongering. So you have the 'rape' and 'incest' scare factors and throw in the 'back alley coathanger dying by the 1,000's' myth, and you've eliminated the picture of a tiny baby being chopped up and vaccuumed out, or being burned in a brine solution, or having its head pierced and its brains sucked out. I guess the feminists are still following Margaret Sanger's eugenicist desire to have fewer minority babies.

2065	It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar. That's all.

2067	With the exception of how the cameras are pointed, you do not need to worry about your privacy at a news conference.
2068	They don't really ask you to swear to the truth about an event that happened in the past. They just raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." But the statement you are about to give only includes information that happened after the fact.
2069	There's no special form in the court to swear a statement. You've been to court, you've seen people swear their statements. Asking you to raise your hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." or something similar. That's all.
2070	Are you sure that you are accurately reporting the information the attorney gave to you? if your vehicle is parked on the private property of your employer, the laws of your state may very well give them the right to enforce this policy. Regardless of what you feel about the policy, chances are that you are an "at will" employee unless you belong to a union. I am not aware of any state or federal law that would protect you if your employer fired you for violating the policy. So you have two choices: (1) stop smoking; or (2) go off the property to smoke.

2075	It's still considered a "right-of-way" violation. The driver with the legal "right-of-way" is the one with the green light, whether he's an idiot or not. Up here in New England (and I'm sure everywhere else), we have a lot of drivers that go for miles with their blinker on. I wait until they have actually started making the turn to go, because once they start turning, they lose the "right-of-way" on the street they were on.

It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many. It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many. You cannot think through EVERY issue by yourself because you have so many. As a result, it is impossible for the U.S. to think through anything properly.  Conservatism say's anything that was done before is right, so in many cases we feel better continuing to do what's been done. B) Holistic asshole Here is some text: {[Richard Dawkins, a Creationist recently expressed his views as follows:] "I do not see the argument for the value of life based on the principle of survival of the fittest being well-founded. I have no doubt that people could compete against one another to see who could breed more offspring, though I don't think this would be much fun. We have a lot more than an intellectual human life to live. There are all sorts of tangible and intangible benefits to life, and I do not believe that these benefits should be discounted in favour of having to jump through hoops to get an extra pair of extra limbs. I would argue that in order to really benefit from life, we must find ways to flourish, not just compete with others for resources.

2086	In fact, conservatives are not the only people who mix other peoples opinions. The result is inconsistent opinion on almost every issue. What a parent believes about abortion is probably not the same as a politician or secularist. An a parent may say that a foetus is not worthy of life, but a politician may say that killing a terrorist is far more important than saving a pregnant woman. An a parent may say that a foetus is not worth, but the rest of us probably believe that human life is extremely valuable. On the other hand, pro-lifers may show their insistence that a lifesource is more valuable by refusing to support emergency contraception or even condoms. In any case, an a parent's opinion isn't worth the rest of us looking over it for inconsistency. How do you think abortion is going to work in a society that permits abortions?  So, given your judgement about which ones you find "logical". What are the odds of there being the one person that is completely logical (assuming there is a random person in America or in India that is logical and unbiased)? Or are logics actually just a matter of taste? (note I'm avoiding almost logic because that's an almost impossible task. When do we say we are almost there, the task we should be doing instead would be to say what are the odds that no one can argue a point back to you with the same logic?) This seems like a smart way to approach the mindset issue:  One of the biggest difficulties in trying to understand human reasoning is the inability to see this complete failure of logical reasoning because we use it frequently.  I think the further we look we see more people fail to grasp that there is logic (call it how a person makes a decision), and people are ignoring logic where logicality exists.  You ask the problems that exist because people are trying to understand personal/individual ways of thinking about issues.  What

It is almost impossible to think through EVERY issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases it could be conservatism is masquarading as pro-life. They are not the same thing. Conservatism says whatever we used to do is right. Pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.  On the other hand, pro-choice could be called inconsistent. Just as an a parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
2088	Inconsistent pro-choice. Just as an a parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the U.S. may feel it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is a bloody mess. Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.

For instance, something like changing the national anthem at the Thanksgiving football game or instructing schools to teach the history of Martin Luther King, Jr. on the days before the day of MLK service are inconsistent, and generally sadden people. But the same thing is true of promoting abortion rights to the point where it can be said to cause as many harms as Martin Luther King did, or as every parent feels they have to do.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
2090	Yes I am completely in favor of it. People are arguing that it's barbaric and inhumane but who can stand up and say that some perv who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live. We would put down a dangerous dog why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in Britain at the moment is hopeless. Many people are getting away with all sorts and something needs to be done!
2091	Yes, it is barbaric, but unethical to execute a man, and it is important to prosecute anyone who carries out such killings. Of course, a man who has sexually abused many young girls needs to be tried and prosecuted.
2092	Yes i am completely for it. People are arguing that it is barbaric and inhuman but who can stand up and say that some perv who has raped and killed a child still has human rights and the right to live? We would put down a dangerous dog why not do the same to some of the scum that lives in our country. The justice system in britain at the moment is hopeless.

2095	Admitting fault is never good and admitting fault while trying to avoid it and trying to look tough in court is worse. In this case, he wrote a ticket for failing to stop at a stop sign. Because of this, if you get hit by a car that was going faster and there was no obstruction on the road, you will be at fault.
2096	You admit fault here and I bet that you admitted fault there too.  Read what you wrote and you will realize that you have no argument in court.  He did not write the ticket for not stopping for the stop sign.  He wrote the ticket for "failing to yield to oncoming traffic at a stop sign."  If you were struck by cross traffic it becomes obvious that you did not yield to their right of way! Your best bet would be to plead "no contest" accepting the courts verdict without admitting guilt, it keeps you from looking foolish by trying to argue an open and closed case, and save face at the same time.
2097	You admitted fault in both cases.  If you stop in a cross traffic in a location where it is dangerous because of the back end do not get kicked in the back by accident or immediately give way.  If you stop at a stop sign which your suspect there may be an accident on the road then kindly yield the right of way.

2100	Therapy can only be considered effective if your stressful life has a severe impact on your personal health. For example, when you are no longer able to function in the society because of your stressful work, mental health would include issues such as hallucinations, delusions and depression.
2101	That way you can avoid hurting other people. Try to teach your children to treat each other as they treat you. Two negatives only make a positive in math. No one should torture anyone or anything because it is unethical and barbaric. Those who think this is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds when they have been tortured.
2102	However, trying to teach children that only consider two minus two to be two may be a little too strict for them and won't work. Therefore, torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable. Those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured.
2103	If you were to think that torturing other people to death is somehow acceptable, then you might think that a mother who would do this for her child is also acceptable. If so, you are barbaric and would gladly stop it once you have been tortured.

As hard as that can be to believe…that is what love is all about…which is not a an act…it is a reflection…and in finding love…you will find out who your TRUE soul mate really is…and a Christian should just pray…not act like some virgin boy about to be worn out by the remainder of his life…
2116	@ lady: @ lady: My previous 2 marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault.  So we should study that aspect more don't you think? Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English... I believe we should study how much holier are we than the rest of us... @ lady: @ lady: We need to study how much religion people have... I realize that the relationships you describe must be extremely beautiful and wonderful, but holy relationship, by definition, is something different.  You cannot so cynically compare morals of your own religion to what another religion teaches. @ lady: @ lady: Yes, you could never make it work... How would you ever prove it? This is a much larger question than just pronouncing a lady's name... And you are on vacation and you are off topic here.  Good for you that you do not believe in polygamy.  Please shut up or you will get blocked...
2117	My previous two marriages had the exes walk out because of cheating. I was not at fault... So we should study that aspect more don't you think?
2118	Well, you should have used Spell check first. Your question is hard to read for those of us that actually speak and write in English. So my answer to this is, which marriage were you speaking of?I am in my third marriage and at my age it would be foolish to act like a virgin this far into my life. I know others that are in their fifth marriage, you think they should wait too? Just exactly how much holier are you than the rest of us?My previous 2 marriages had the exes walk out on me because of cheating, and I was not at fault. So we should study that aspect more. Don't you think?I do not agree with your logic or attitude. Sorry.You could never make it work. How would you ever prove it?
2119	Well, it would have been nice if you had checked spelling before you posted so you would not make mistakes like spelling cheaters instead of cheating. How do you claim that certain marriage or age is right or wrong. If you had studied your religion you would know that what you are saying is incorrect... Being a virgin till marriage does not mean that it is immoral... that is for other religions. If you had stayed in your previous marriages you wouldn't have had to say such things.
2120	If a law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, I think that at least some people need to break the law in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court. For example, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat because she thought it was wrong and that it was immoral.
2121	This is true. If someone was seriously hurt or killed by some serious violations of the law, then it makes sense to break the law. But if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, for example when the law would impose an extra punishment on someone based on his skin color.
2122	If the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate, some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court, for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.

2124	Be good. Justice is not the only thing that matters; love, bravery, diligence, the beautiful quality of true courage, the kind of courage where you dare to face the difficulties of this world...that's what gets our souls up in the morning. It's not just the violence of the world that we need to be afraid of; our weakest friends can be our worst enemies. We do not need to remind ourselves of the goodness within us; it suffices to be reminded by the ugliness of the world of its vulnerability.

2126	Ok so I would never let anyone know this publicly, hence the post, but I really did enjoy Battlefield Earth. The acting is pretty poor, but it is at least a decent Sci-Fi movie, with a good amount of action. I liked the thought of post-war America, has some shout outs to ft hood, knox, and a couple other famous cities. The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it is on, I tend to watch it. Right now the biggest movie I want to see is The Italian Job

The learning machine allows the humans to become intelligent, travolta getting his comeuppance at the end. I gotta say, if it is on, I tend to watch it.
2130	I cannot find a citation right now [on mobile], but i have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community. Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.

2132	Before anything else, here are definitions from the Oxford Dictionary  Pornography:  "Printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."  Explicit:  "Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion."  I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was "pornographic" when the text is not sexy or titilating...

2134	The definition of "pornography" should come from the community. If the community does not know what "pornography" is, they shouldn't be able to define it. If the community has an opinion on the term "sexually explicit," they should not be able to define it without coming up with a reason for that opinion and citing information that backs it up.
2135	We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession and just create a better welfare system.
2136	This can be read into the short debate that could possibly occur over one or two things. If I am in favour of the building of subways and only a party that supports that is for that project is at the time, I am not taking it into account.
2137	Here is an example. At the very least, no matter which party or which candidate wins, good things will get done. At the very most, if party Y wins, some major scandal will be dished out and there's a 25% chance of them being in a fight or conflict with the others. At worst, they've got something horrible coming down the pipeline that no one knows about and no one is to say no to. And, of course, there's a fair chance of corruption. And, of course, the incumbent will completely cancel what their predecessors did to put their own mark on things and this just continues in a cycle.
2138	This is probably more of a Canadian issue but regardless which party you want to put in power you need to be careful about what they do and who they let on the board of directors. There's a 20% chance of some major scandal and there will definitely be corruption.  There's a bigger chance of a scandal if you're the Liberal Party because they trust the government more to do good instead of bad.
2139	This is most definitely not a situation where you should rely on my political beliefs for your own political thinking. The only thing you have to look at is the policies.
2140	Instruments are so limiting in modern composition software compared to normal composition programs, that I think they're obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfections, and you can't control the frequencies of the sounds you're making. People will spend years learning how to make one sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you're just an atomaton, someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier vs being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.

2145	I'm confused, why would not using meat or eggs from factory farming be harmful to the people and animals involved? People make it seem like it's so bad it's downright evil.. but what else do they do that isn't nice?  I can't think of a reason why people don't get fed properly or if they do something wrong is still fine.. and i don't think that factory farming is the solution since it still hurts animals.. what about getting all the meat we need from animals that don't live any hurtful way? or make farms public, where everyone can have access to good meat? and don't eat meat from a free range chick.. i dont even think it should be healthy.. or do we just have to make it so hard for people to eat meat that its a problem? I dont think a lot of people are aware of the true situation of how badly animals are treated, or even care what they do, but i do think it's not right what animals are being fed and treated any how!..
2146	I'm being asked a moral question here, because until now, I have thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food, is morally right, because there animals don't understand death, like a human does. They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill them or not.  As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok, as long as the animals are treated right, and fair. That's why I'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with un needed cruelty, or atleast it seems like they do.  But here comes the question: is it wrong to actually eat meat from these factories? How bad are they treating the animals? The meat is still live. How are the animals treated, during the processing of their meat? As the main meat producers try to cover up these crimes, the chains are getting longer and more violent, sometimes spreading to other countries.   These men and women that make up these factories have some terrible personalities, I have read stories of them hanging up dead animals, throwing them into cages and neglecting them.   I have also heard of attacks by consumers trying to find these horrible things out.   But I don't really understand how these companies can operate this way.   It's a little like a fishing line, to keep it sharp for more business, they do this.  I don't know if I need to update this too much or not, but overall, I think it's the wrong path, cause it's not a right answer from any perspective. I'm searching for a good answer but i couldn't find one,  I'll be glad to add more questions and arguments as time goes on, and as I hear about more of the facts.  There's one more question I want to ask. As for the fetus, when you say "mortal," how do you
2147	I'm not sure about killing an animal for fun and entertainment, because there animals have not a sense of what death is, like a human does. They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not. As for producing animals, to eat meat, I think this is acceptable as long as the animals are treated right, and fair. I don't agree with factory farming, because people make it seem horrible, but I don't know. Also I don't want to eat meat, so I am not going to.
2148	Being a vegan is a good way to live life and make a difference to animals being mistreated and killed in uncalled for ways.   Food is important, and it can also be produced in animals factories but it is important to take care of the animals and treat them with respect and mercy.   Being a vegan, can be a very difficult decision but there is a reason why this is a good policy, to protect the animals in this world.
2149	I'm being a vegetarian, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with unnecessary cruelty or at least it seems like they do.

2155	After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup wasn't signed that is, one partner usually receives alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive them. If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It is stupid, I think. If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options.

2160	There was no downside to Nirvana's success..it just made them look even more childish and overrated than they already were, and they were guilty of baseless wackos smoking things and selling out as well. I also don't see how earning a billion and a half dollar in one year is less than making 10 million a year working.
2161	This is more of a subjective opinion, but I think it depends on what you mean by other bands. When I was younger I think a lot of bands were categorized into 12 genre's: pop, rock, alternative, techno, electronica, metal, hip hop, dance, goth, punk, R&B and others. Some were just classed as 'electro' because the song structure was limited to the intro, verse, chorus and outro. Others were classed as ''bonkers'' because they didn't know how to form a good bass line or the tempo of their songs was slower than other bands. It was impossible for any of us to say Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Eagles, Rush, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Helloween, Iron Maiden and any other band that we loved were just 'brownnosers' for all of us. Today we have so many genres that people are all too quick to label as being one genre or another depending on what direction they take. I personally think that Nirvana broke most music genres and defined that entire sound. The melodies were beautiful and haunting. They listened to the feeling and melody and used them in a perfect number of cases. I have listened to a lot of bands and listened to a few amazing records, but it's always been unique to that band and their style of music. For example 'Pumping' by Massive Attack was one of the best records I heard and it broke the pop and techno sound. 'Eat and be merry' by Bon Jovi was one of my favorite bands and really defined
2162	Watching documentaries and reading books about the Seattle scene, it is common to hear references to how good some other bands were. I think the Melvins said they were a bunch of bums who hit the jackpot. Well I've gone back and listened to a lot of bands Mudhoney, Green River, Sonic youth and others and I'm sorry to say I never heard anything close to a 'Lithium' or a 'Smells like teen spirit'.Those songs are magical and have beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies and really good pop hooks. There were other great bands that are in the same league like Pearl jam and to a lesser extent Alice in Chains and Soundgarden..but no I don't buy the story that Nirvana were 'just another band'.
2163	Many people say that the Surf covered in most bands songs but really out of all of them the 'lesser' ones, Mudhoney, Green River, Sonic youth and others...none of those bands sounded like Nirvana. Many people also said that the Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Green River bands were the best....and I have to admit that while some of the songs of Sonic youth, Nirvana and Green River had beautiful, haunting and unforgettable melodies, to me they all sounded very similar. Some of the songs of Sonic youth, Nirvana and Green River, especially the ones that every people listen to like the first 9 of Alice in chains, the beginning of 'Peculiarity' and 'Oh, I don't wanna wait' in Pearl Jam, 'Acceptance' by Soundgarden, and 'Been around long enough' in Melvins, the songs that have earned those bands massive amounts of fame, they all seemed very similar to songs of Sonic youth, Nirvana and Green River. On the other hand, while some of Nirvana's songs, I couldn't hear anything close to 'Lithium' or 'Smells like teen spirit' except in Nirvana albums. The sound was different to me but I like 'Lithium' and 'Smells like teen spirit'. Also I would prefer some songs in albums; the entire 10 minutes of 'I am the mechanism' or the entire 30 minutes of 'Smells like teen spirit' than some bands solo songs. I would listen to the entire album of 'Moby Dick' or the entire 'Lithium' before I listen to some of Soundgarden, Melv
2164	...while the Melvins talked about hitting the jackpot, I guess they were taking it pretty seriously. There were other great bands in the same league. Like, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains..I don't think there were many really great bands in the 90s.
2165	You are a jerk for saying those bad words. I have never heard anyone say those nasty words about Spaghetti. Usually it is a mix of bad jokes and sarcasm. But that isn't in the example you provided. If you want to use sarcasm, don't use the above sentence. I am also sure you know what karma is, if you didn't answer the question about karma itself.
2166	It seems to me that many long sections in the comments I can't even understand are bullshit because there's only one one opinion.
2167	On Reddit there's long sections of comments I can't even understand. People saying things to each other about spaghetti and quoting the Transformer movies? Karma is overflowing, and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives? I'm sickened.  Only the first person to tell me "Factually, my dear, I don't give a damn" gets an upvote. None thereafter.
2168	When no one can clearly defend their truth, it means no one can clearly stand in the way of their truth. A person must stand in the way of his own truth.

2170	as an academic definition it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with, based on historical and present discrimination. But whereas used outside sociological theory, it instead is an excuse to simply dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with. I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.

2172	As an academic definition, it makes sense that some people benefit from characteristics they are born with. But where it becomes really bizarre is when it's used outside sociological theory. E.g. "You are privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid". I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem. For example, just saying someone is privileged could mean a big lot of things. Perhaps the person you disagree with is racist or sexist or that's why you do their perspective or something. So using privilege to justify a counterargument to someone based on it is a bit worrying and I feel like it would be more welcome as a comment if a reader pointed it out.

2175	the hunting business is dirty. It involves killing and exploiting animals and human beings and with these, it contributes to the extinction of different types of wildlife. Why would hunters or hunters and fishermen be more morally irresponsible than other types of land and water exploitative?
2176	However, the problem with hunters is that they ruin wildlife habitats while poaching does not necessarily take that extreme. Besides, poachers also threaten or endanger animal species for the sake of profit. In other words, the purpose of these activities is the same. Whereas, anti-poaching initiative do not really stop poaching at all. Also, those advocating for this initiative might be doing so to propel their own credibility or to garner public attention. This shows hypocrisy in itself.
2177	This could also be an important ethical perspective on the human impulse to eat animals. Not every animal is necessarily destroyed for the sake of "consumption," of course, but, I wonder how moral is it to ignore the life of an animal that we don't wish for ourselves and feed it to another animal that wants it.
2178	This view is only motivated by paranoia and hatred for his family and fellow human beings, but a deep moral crisis is looming for this country and its citizens.
2179	The IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "protecting the wildlife" is a hypocritical no. 1. Because it does not make the existence of mankind better, it does not stop the extinction of various species in wildlife, it may also extend extinct species existence for the sake of men and women in the name of being 'leave alone' and thus encouraging; and 2. it does not make the existence of mankind better, it does not stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings, it may also extend extinct species existence for the sake of men and women in the name of being 'leave alone' and thus encouraging.
2180	Observing depictions of human death and suffering has become the past time for millions of kids around the world. To think that the mind is not being trained to be more violent through media seems illogical to me. In ww2 there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting there guns and not having the will power to, so the militarily started introducing the man shaped silhouette to pop up so the soldiers could learn based on stimulus response to shoot a human figure. Kids are being taught that they can gain points or a high score through human death and suffering. Change your view?
2181	Personally, I think games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield are good to have to watch human death and suffering. Observing realism in soldiers, except for some exceptions like gtatu cpsigns, i don't think this is a bad thing in or gaming environment. To think that the mind is not being trained to be violent through media seems illogical to me. In World War II there was a serious problem with soldiers not shooting their guns, so the military started introducing the man shape silhouette to pop up, so the soldiers could learn based on stimuli response to shoot a human figure. Kids are being taught that they can get points or score through human death and suffering.  In the line of sight, i would really like there to be a more humanized or realistic depictions of war in new games.
2182	Observing the brutal realism in games such as call of duty and battlefield mirrors the cop and soldier training simulators designed to teach people mindless shooting.  Man shaped silhouettes have long been an integral part of military training to teach soldiers to shoot. As real blood and human suffering is not the primary stimulus for warriors in war games like Call of Duty, it is important to point out the necessity for the practice of realism to teach the thought process that leads to violent killing.  War games are an integral part of soldier training.  The soldiers training technique is based on simulating life threatening situations which leads them to analyze their mental and emotional response to the various stimuli they face, real or simulated.  Kids have used violence on a daily basis because it's convenient and entertaining to them.  They are taught that they will be rewarded in the present for destroying someone through abstract or made up destruction methods that often leads to violent killing, which the children will probably then remember, practice or even participate in later on in their lives.  The realism in war games and it's use in training provide more morality on how war is conducted, what the world looks like, and the end result of violence and destruction.  In this age of immorality and destruction, we need to keep our focus on the real goal of war games, not it's benefits in simulation.

2185	To address starvation today is to slow it down for future generations. Anything we do today that causes more quick hunger will only make a problem bigger tomorrow or in the future. It's better to avoid problems in the first place and instead just give people what they want when they're down and out. We're not helping the damn poor at all by donating money and delivering rice to them.
2186	It is not a good idea to donate free rice to third world countries because it hides a problem in the short term and denies the livelihood of the third world country's farmers. It should be money for subsidizing farmers which would increase food production and employment opportunities from the larger food industry of the countries.
2187	For example, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hids a problem when a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people any form of farming or other food production of that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in that third world country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.

2190	Anybody can end up a millionaire. You don't have to be smart or smarty-pants. You can be a paralyzed person in a wheelchair and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking. You could be an African American or Pacific Islander transgendered or multisexual and have chronic diarrhea and paralyzed from the neck down, but if you have a 190 IQ you can still become rich, famous, and have a pretty good spot in life. Change my point of view.
2191	One of the most important things about being is having the will to succeed. That means if you have a 190 IQ and you have the will to succeed, and also you have the desire to build yourself up as a person then you can do anything and become rich, famous, and in almost any way that you want to. Otherwise, if you have nothing going for you other than your brain and intelligence and you only have the will to fail and fail and fail, then you're just as fit to be out there as if you had a wrecked car.
2192	Hi. There are one thing that is way more important than smarts. And that is: you really want to succeed. You have to have a reason in order to succeed: a purpose. Without a purpose, you will lose motivation. Once you lose motivation, you lose everything.
2193	When people talk about privilege they forget about the most important one. Not everybody has the will and the dedication to succeed. Smarts are useful, but only when you work for them.  If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed and still succeed in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking.  He has almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He is still successful. You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/transsexual person/multisexual pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia but you have a 190 IQ you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life. { Change my view. {One one of the weaknesses of our time is that we are asking our children to have their intelligence honed and optimized according to the jobs of today. I believe we are disadvantaging them because we are training them to solve problems we couldn't solve. Instead we are training them to succeed in a world where there are new, more complex problems that they are going to have to solve in the future.
2194	Changing my view on privilege. If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking. He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life. Change my view. Swearrengen changed my view. Smarts are worthless without motivation and dedication. The will to succeed is a lot more important than just being a smarty-pants.
2195	No matter how important or influential a country is, that does not mean that it will forever retain power and power will one day pass. I believe that it is dangerous for any country to be able to make other countries put their lives on the line for them.
2196	Views should be changed until we get out of this recession!
2197	Because there are 5 countries with the greatest influence on the world defined through a mix of economics, political, military power, and human rights records (defined as only looking at their record over the last 100 years), any country that falls far enough in any of those categories (defined only as defined by a count over the last 100 years), will lose their seat. As for the remaining seats, they will be filled as they currently are.... As for the veto power, I believe that it should be overpowered, for proof of this look towards North Korea. I believe a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue.
2198	North Korea was on the Security Council because a 2/3 majority voted for them being in the council.  Thus they can act as they please. This also tells us that a 2/3 majority is enough to get an issue passed to be implemented. I also believe that if a majority of 5 countries does not support a current group then they should lose their seats.
2199	One of the 5 countries that have the largest influence in the world (defined by a mix of economics, political, military, and human rights). Countries that fall far enough in any of those will lose their seat. As for the rest of the seats they would be filled as they currently are. As for the veto power I believe that it is overpowered, for proof of this look at North Korea...I believe that a 2/3 majority should be enough to get action on an issue. The other countries need not act
2200	This isn't referring to depression because of a terminal illness, but specifically to clinical depression for years. Decades even.  I don't view suicide as a choice. It's a fight or flight response. Some people cope others don't. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death. However, temporary bouts of suicidal behavior should be treated but at a certain point it becomes so chronic that pain overshadows pleasure. When someone has suffered for years with suicide but have held off because of guilt from family they are literally tortured into accepting life rather than be allowed to bow out peacefully.
2201	When depression is in an individual, and the depression was never caused by a terminal illness, and the depression has occurred for many years, and the depression has led to the individual wanting to end their life, they should be allowed to do so but if it involves prolonged anguish and pain, people should be allowed to accept life and have a purpose that is meaningful to them.   We shouldn't allow people to walk out of our lives while we are in our twenties and third decades thinking they didn't have a purpose. I think we need to be considerate of that and not shut a person out of their life like that.  
2202	This isn't referring to depression because of a terminal illness, but specifically about clinical depression prompting suicidal urges for years. Decades even. I don't view suicide as a choice - it's a fight or flight response. Some people cope others don't.  Also my philosophy on the value of life undoubtedly skews my stance. I don't believe that anyone has an objective, inherent value and that disallowing someone to end their life promotes their suffering for the comfort of society being uncomfortable with death.

2205	Marilyn Monroe is worthy of elegant, classy idol status because her life was a mixture of success and tragedy. She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement), but she should be in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone? She was not classy. She was not elegant. At best, she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day. Change my view.
2206	Marilyn Monroe is not an undeserving idol. At best she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day. She ruined her two marriages, because of her promiscuous and unhealthy relationships. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Any woman today that exhibits this kind of behavior would be considered an asshole and may be coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone? Although she was not classy, elegant, or at the grand opera level of refinement, she was definitely an excellent performer. Change my view
2207	Marilyn Monroe was not worthy of the elegant, classy idol status she has because she ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women.

2208	Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement). Nevertheless, she should in no way be considered a role model to women. Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?
2209	And in my opinion, Marilyn Monroe was an uncouth, unpleasant, unkempt person who should have never been considered a role model for women today. There are countless reports of her being difficult in professional situations, and she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. Now, none of these things make her a bad person (although the wives of the married men she slept with might disagree with that statement) but she should not be considered a role model to women, which is exactly what Courtney Love does by projecting her image as an icon for women.
2210	There are plenty of people in Britain who don't like Margaret Thatcher. But there are plenty more that love her. I know a man from London who believes she is a great leader. She is also referred as "The Iron Lady". I can't stand this woman and how she can infuriates people.
2211	My parents and brothers in this country have had huge negative reaction to Margaret Thatcher. I have heard many people say that when they were young they loved her but now they love her less because of the tragedies that she allowed in this country and to their great dismay she is still with us, I can't stand that she is still part of our country and there is still public support for her. I can't believe that a man from a London suburb can say that she is a great leader and I think we need to have an attitude to our current dictator in which we can say that she is one of the worst.
2212	I've grown up in rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to dislike Margaret Thatcher. While on hunger strike she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners and they died shortly after despite massive public outcry. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. People I know from these areas hate her. But recently to my disbelief, I met a man from London who believed she was a great leader. She is also called "The Iron Lady". I cannot stand this woman and how anyone can be so frivolous.
2213	Margaret Thatcher is not a great leader. It just so happens to be the time that she's remembered for her politics. There are more people like her than her detractors.
2214	In rural Ireland in a patriotic area and have been raised to hate Margaret Thatcher. When she became prime minister, she denied Bobby Sands and other IRA members the title of political prisoners. They died shortly after in protest against her continued refusal to cooperate with them. Her time as prime minister saw huge decay in Britain's old industries as poverty became widespread in Wales, Scotland and North England. I believe a lot of people in these areas hate Margaret Thatcher. But recently, I met a man from London who believed Margaret Thatcher was a great leader. She is also referred to as "the Iron Lady". I cannot stand this woman and how anyone can infuriate me.
2215	In point of view, I really didn't like the movie, except the 5 minute opening sequence. The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning.  The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status.
2216	While Drive is a boring movie, and some people hate it, it was the best film in 2007.  The cinematography was great and the songs were awesome.  There was an exciting 5 minute opening sequence.  The acting was weak and most of the characters were played by a single actor.
2217	The main reason that Drive became so popular is due to the high budget of the film and the uniqueness of the story. Many people liked it because it seemed like a good and unique film about drug addiction, alcoholism, and violence against women.
2218	IMHO, Drive was a good movie despite its flaws. The characters were well written and the film was inspiring. The acting was great and the cinematography was well thought out. The visual style was unique and the storyline was well structured. The realistically portrayed characters had high moral values. Most people I spoke to during and after the theaters were impressed with the film. I think the producers were wise to take advantage of the fan-base it brought in.
2219	For the movie Drive we went to the theater in 2006.   Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVED the movie.  The reasons they gave were usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc.  Now I don't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year.  I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies.  The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning.  The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'Top 10 movie of the year' status.  All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.  Viewers who loved it, are you CMV?
2220	It is important that we learn more about how processed foods have a huge effect on our health and keep a close eye on companies that deal in processed foods. But we should not be comparing processed foods to natural foods.
2221	"HFCS is dangerous because it's a chemical that raises the blood sugar and sugar, causing obesity. While I understand it's cheaper, it's by no means better and the bottled water industry should no longer use it."
2222	Disagree that HFCS is better than cane sugar. Any type of artificial sugar can cause cancer, obesity or worse. Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA and tests have proven that there are contaminates of mercury in some batches of HFCS. The corn industry is VERY corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business. Finding a reason to not use HFCS is best counterpointed with an example.
2223	I am strongly against HFCS because, in short, it kills people. While I understand it is cheaper, it is by no means better than raw sugar. Examples.  1.)  Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity, or even cancer. 2.)  Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminates of mercury in some batches of HFCS 3.) HFCS and cane sugar are NOT biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way 4.) The corn industry is VERY corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy  I believe that HFCS should not be used by major companies such as coca cola and Pepsi. It has a terrible impact on the quality of the product, and destroys our health, and our economy.
2224	Unfortunately, HFCS and cane sugar are not biochemically identical and our bodies do not process them the same way. The corn industry is corrupt and has caused local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy. Therefore I am against HFCS and to find one example is easier.
2225	This has always happened in real life and online.

Let's please ignore inflammatory racist statements. We all know they're bad.   This "that's racist" trump card is played virtually any time race is a component of the discussion.   A recent example is the Cuban NBA fiasco (let's please not debate that) where Mark Cuban said, "If a black male in a hoodie is walking down the street, he would stop and take a closer look. If the man had neck tattoos, he would have to change sides."   Cue outrage. The response is "that's racist."   I don't believe that "that's racist" inherently discredits an argument or observation.

2230	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
2231	Anime's are generally a lot better than manga's, it's just how the anime's sit with what the manga writer writes.
2232	It is not the quality of the anime that is great, but the setting of the anime. Anime is genre rather than quality. Genres often taste like chinese food or biscuits and gravy, and will leave you depressed. Bleach contains abhorrent violence in an attempt to cover up the lack of plot and have the characters act out a major moment from the manga. This is extremely insulting to the audience of FMA, and even worse for the FMA fans, since they are the main audience for that show.
2233	tv is a good news network.
2234	Anime doesn't necessarily have to be good to be considered great. Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable series but when you look at all the anime you see the vastly different quality and storylines. FMA was set strongly at 51 episodes and was never based on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of it's strengths as storylines that chug on for ages lose steam. Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to. FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam. The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.
2235	Although eBay serves only as a market medium for connecting suppliers with consumers I would say eBay is better from an economic perspective. With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency. Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at. They may not be working at optimum efficiency.

2238	It is an obvious choice. Although, eBay operates with a more self targeting market, unlike Amazon, who uses consumer price-targeting. In other words, the price that people set to sell things on eBay is based on what they are willing to spend.

2240	final fantasy is better because if you look at it compared to kingdom hearts, final fantasy has better graphics and a better story line. I must admit kingdom hearts does have some good features, but you fight little black creatures called heartless and grey empty bodys called nobodies. and the biggest ruiner is that you do it all with a key. plus some final fantasy games are turn based, but that just makes it a little better. The final fantasy trilogy has been out since the nes, i have played the first final fantasy (the original) so i can honestly say that not only has final fantasy been out longer and had a better run than most games but you cant beat final fantasy 7 on rating any day. Also in kingdom hearts 2 you can see tipha sephiroth and cloud but with different names like roxas is the kid form of cloud. i rest my case.
2241	Final Fantasy is better because if you look at it compared to Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy has better graphics and a better story line. I must admit Kingdom Hearts does have some good features but you fight little black creatures called Heartless and Grey Empty Bodys called No Body’s.

2242	Although Final Fantasy VII is overall a good game, compared to Kingdom Hearts II, it is much inferior to the other four final fantasy games. Kingdom Hearts II was the best of all the final fantasy games that came out on the NES. Final Fantasy VII is a good game, but it is not as good as the first two final fantasy games on the NES. Kingdom Hearts II was the best of all the final fantasy games that came out on the NES. Final Fantasy VII is a good game, but it is not as good as the first two final fantasy games on the NES.
2243	Kingdom Hearts 2 also has better graphics than Final Fantasy 7. Lastly, in Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy has been out longer and had a better run than many games and Kingdom Hearts has been out for a while but it still hasn't gotten a really good rating in comparison to Final Fantasy 7. I think that Final Fantasy 7 has more features and better graphics but Kingdom Hearts is the most known game and may also be better. I rest my case.
2244	Kingdom hearts is better than Final Fantasy because of the greater graphics and a better story line. Although, Final Fantasy 7 is better in rating than Kingdom Hearts 2. Tifa and Sephiroth are a little bit hidden in Final Fantasy 7, but in Kingdom Hearts 2, they are very easily seen. In other words, Kingdom Hearts 2 has better graphics than Final Fantasy 7. However, Final Fantasy 7 has better gameplay than Kingdom Hearts 2. Final Fantasy 7 is also better in the plot, although Kingdom Hearts 2 has a better one. Final Fantasy 7 is a better trilogy than Kingdom Hearts 2. Final Fantasy 7 has more action than Kingdom Hearts 2. Final Fantasy 7 has more depth of character than Kingdom Hearts 2.

2245	Arguments about the existence of God are in fact, useless. They can be disproven using more logic. It can be reffered to David Hume's "Matter of Facts."

2250	Global warming is an issue that affects the whole world, so the Global bit is necessary. America is supposed to be known for not having any qualms about rushing into other countries, taking what's theirs from them and bringing them back to their ancient ways. If America really wants to help the whole world, it should do something more than say it will. They should come up with an action plan that really involves the rest of the world, and is not just one country and little hope of success.
2251	Regarding the global warming issue, and as one of the largest C02 producers, the United States needs to show sincere effort to help fix the problem rather than promote its own economic agenda. We need to help people around the world.
2252	Global warming is an issue that affects the whole world, not just the USA. It is no secret that America seems to have pride in being the country with no qualms in rushing into other countries to'save' and 'liberate' it from evil forces (even if the rest of the world doesn`t always agree). If America is serious about helping the rest of the world, then it needs to pull its weight on the global warming problem.
2253	There is a lot of Global Warming problem, that's why global isn't appropriate. Bush needs to see that America does contribute to this problem, or it would just be another anti global warmig issue.
2254	Global warming is a problem that affects the whole world, hence the global part of the issue. America seems to pride itself on being a country that no matter what, no matter where it's in, loves to get involved in politics overseas. If the United States wants to help the world, then it needs to take charge of its contribution to global warming. As one of the largest carbon dioxide producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge to decrease the impact that America has on the environment. As one of the biggest carbon dioxide producers, the least that Bush can do is pledge to limit the impact that America has on the environment.
2255	Don't get me wrong...you really have to have a drug conviction in order for them to convince me otherwise. But there are so many more circumstances than drug-related that lead to us being in jail that is one of the few things that should be left up to our own moral resolutions. We should keep our conversations civil and allow our countrymen to have other opinions.
2256	The points against torture are numerous but the most important one is that it doesn' t work. All of these “ticking time bomb” scenarios are fantasy right out of “24”. That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren’t we supposed to be the good guys? How in the world do we expect to keep our supposed moral superiority when we debase ourselves by stooping to the level of our enemies? If someone wants to argue we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in the war on terror, shouldn’t we have rounded up all the German Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn’t we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don’ t think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn’t follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
2257	According to my point of view, I don't think we should attempt to go to other countries or hit them with torture. The points against it are numerous, but the most important one is that it doesn't work. All of these scenarios are just fantasy right out of 24. That just doesn't happen in the real world. Another point against it, shouldn't we be the good guys? How in the world do we expect to keep our supposed moral superiority when we stoop to the level of our enemies?

Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
2258	Our domestic policies are flawed and they bring with them a lot of unpleasant things, such as torture, segregation, and discrimination. Our government puts a lot of emphasis on giving soldiers money and lots of other things. They make people feel like the government is actually working for them. This will drive people off of the military and maybe create a conspiracy amongst the soldiers and the government, which is hard to break. This can create the enemy within the military and potentially lead to war. I think the most important point against torture is that it doesn't work. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24". That just does not happen in the real world. Another point against it: aren't we supposed to be the good guys?

If someone wants to argue we need to get down to our enemies level to really be effective in the war on terror, shouldn't we have rounded up all the German-Americans in WWII and burned them in ovens? Shouldn't we have gotten down to the German level to be really effective? I don't think the U.S. can seriously dictate to other countries when it doesn't follow the dictates of its own Constitution.
2259	The points against torture are numerous. One of the most important ones is that torture doesn't work. All of these "ticking time bomb" scenarios are fantasy right out of "24".

2260	 Abortion should not be legal, because there are two reasons. Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some. Also, anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Here is my solution to the issue: Once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.
2261	It shouldn't take more than 2 reasons to make the first-born born into unwanted baby, knowing that the parent was prevented from getting an abortion can be emotionally devastating, even if you know at this point that it is unwanted. There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way...you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
2262	Which is not to say those who choose to want their babies, should be solely made responsible for their actions or how they raise the children.
2263	Anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Good parents won't do that to their child.
2264	Three reasons: - Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted and the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some. - Anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them aborted would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. The way I see this one, I wouldn't support abortion. I would just watch them make themselves ready for a baby, and give them a home and resources.
2265	As for the rich and the poor we have to say that we need people with a heart to fight for equality. Having poor people exploited is bad for society. No healthcare, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution. But we should tax them 20% so that every human can enjoy our freedom.
2266	Everyone needs help. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. And having poor people exploited is bad for society. No heathcare, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship. This does not mean taxing people 20%, rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
2267	The poor needs help. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer unless we intervene. And having poor people exploited is bad for society. No healthcare, no legal representation and political representation, and there will be blood spilled.

2268	In the first place, having poor people exploited is bad for society. No health care, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship. This does not mean taxing people 20%, rather, it just means making it a societal goal to help the poor and invest in the people.
2269	The poor needs help because they are less productive and don't bring in any revenue for the society. The rich will get richer because they have their wealth. If you don't intervene, there will be some poor people that are exploited and some will fight back with a revolution. If it results in a dictatorship, the wealthy will have the power. The poor should be helped with a government help as there is no wealth in their country.
2270	I just watched the original debate on the Houses of Parliament on TV (some programme about Tony Blair's legacy). I have to say that I think if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2271	Even if a war is declared against 7 member nations, the added benefits of having all seven nations on board would have averted the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2272	If the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2273	The additional costs and risks involved in the difficulties that resulted from the negotiations that led up to the failed Operation Agincourt campaign would have been avoided had the UK and US joined in the joint attempt to force a declaration of war.
2274	It makes me wonder why, that if the steps had been taken to secure a binding resolution the added benefits of having all seven member nations on board would have averted much of the disasterous nature of engagement and subsequent occupation.
2275	Recently, engineers have recreated the diesel engine. No longer is it the loud smoke chugging brute of an engine. Rather, it now has mileage that rivals hybrids (a new VW diesel car gets 75 miles to the gallon, beating out the Toyota Prius) and has more eco-friendly emissions than ever before.  Its not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however until we get more efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point. Hydrogen as a combustive fuel is being researched right now and seems quite plausible as well.

Rather, it now has mileage that rivals hybrids (a new Volkswagen diesel car gets 75 miles to the gallon, beating out the Toyota Prius) and has more eco-friendly emissions than ever before. The diesel was a bad idea in the first place, only keeping its status as a reputable legacy. It was a no-no because it was a much less environmentally friendly engine than most competing gas engines.
2277	Recently, engineers have been recreating the diesel engine. Now that it’s much quieter and cleaner to drive, it can match the performance of hybrids and even beat them in gas mileage. It’s not smart to bank our future on fossil fuels and the like forever, however, until we get more efficient electric/other technologies it seems like a great stepping point.

2280	They are two fundamentally different sports. One requires frequent runs and teamwork and the other requires frequent knee strikes and deflection of blows. Because it is combined with the other two, the challenges of game play are more intense and games are longer (the game is really late, new Zealand probably has three extra weeks).
2281	Wow. This isn't good. According to you all, rugby is an inferior sport because it's not all tackle and running games with burly men chugging around with guns? If rugby is never going to get serious support any time soon, why do we have to support a sport that gets so little serious support?
2282	No, I didn't create this debate, and yes, I will be standing up for rugby. It occurs to me that rugby is the superior sport for three main reasons: 1) Rugby is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. And they run a lot. Like constantly, coupled with constant attack and defense, with no time-outs and no dead plays. 2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors. 3) No pads. Rugby hits are just as hard, but there is no armor to stop the blow. Skills are just as complex and beautiful, but the force of the impacts are not diffused through barriers. Sport in the raw.
2283	No, I didn't create this debate. In fact I think Rugby is the superior sport because it is a combination of the two most basic forms of athleticism, running and wrestling. And they run a LOT. This has the most to do with it and was my first thought. Also, it opens up this one up to everyone. I don't think shoes are as crucial in this one as in soccer. I guess that would say that in your book or even what I'd do if I got this on athletics day with my student body, there wouldn't be any apparel on. With a player's body being thrown around by players, it is a guess as to how dirty or clean of a player you are playing with.  The aggressive nature of this sport and the style of play that has been sewn into it in the last couple decades makes it different than a lot of other sports. What's not to like about that?  The three hand rule. Well, even with it, the competitiveness of the sport, and the rules themselves, keeps the sport dynamic and interesting. Certainly Rugby, when played by the best players, can break up a team from time to time, and many a time has. In fact, rugby (countries who do it well) doesn't like an aggressive mindset from their players at all.  They need to be dictated to and played out, but the way they play, it's always a team sport.  A very hard sport to play, but a very exciting one to watch. 
2284	Yes, I did create this debate and I will be standing up for Rugby.

2285	There's a lot of controversy over coffee's use as a stimulant. However, going back 5,000 years, the cannabis compound, THC, is responsible for marijuana's use as medicine. THC has been used for its medicinal effects, including painkilling and the relief of nausea and vomiting, long before coffee was discovered. 
2286	Drink coffee isn't always a good idea because it isn't a medical benefit. On the other hand, going back over 5,000 years, marijuana's active ingredient THC has been used for many health benefits, more so the stalk, leaves and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings and other materials as well. No contest! Marijuana is above coffee in terms of health benefits.
2287	To be honest, coffee does not have any medical benefits. As the stimulant and good tasting water, it does not have any medicated value. On the other hand, marijuana has been used for thousands of years. It's active ingredient, THC, has been used for many health benefits. The stalks, leaves, and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings, and other materials. So, no contest! Tea and coffee should be limited to green tea and coffee.
2288	Being a stimulant and tasting good is not a medical benefit. On the other hand going back over 5,000 years marihuana's active ingredient THC has been used for many health benefits, and the stalk, leaves and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings and other materials as well.. No Contest!. Marijuana places high above coffee.
2289	This is a no brainer, coffee has no medical benefits and going back over 5,000 years marihuana's active ingredient THC has been used for many health benefits, moroever the stalk, leaves and seeds have been used to manufacture rope, canvas, clothings and other materials as well.... No Contest!
2290	Absolutely not. Why am I obliged to provide for my bum of a neighbor? Your’re in effect forcing individuals to make contributions to charities without their consent. Set up voluntary support associations, with reasonable criteria for the support applicants (e.g. they're in the process of trying to get a job/education), and then I'm interested. Give tax breaks to those who contribute (this already happens when you contribute to a recognized charity). Provide insurance benefits only to those who’ve contributed in the past. Even require applicants to pay back the dole they've received, if you wish. But don't tell me what a worthy cause is. That's my decision.

2295	College athletes do get paid. However, going to college costs money, if they are good enough and maintain a gpa, they receive scholarships. This makes the school a financial debt relief for them. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 an using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is automatically no.
2296	College athletes should be allowed to earn money, but college sports should not be for profit. If it is a state school, the answer is automatically no.
2297	If you live in a state which has not passed a legislation which prohibits academic institutions from disburse receiving scholarships on behalf of college athletes then the answer is definitely yes college athletes get paid.
2298	It doesn't matter how much college athletes get paid, it is a business just like any other. Using its state money for the good of others is what colleges should be doing.
2299	College athletes get paid because it costs money to go to college and they have to maintain a GPA. The question here, is not whether or not college athletes get paid but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school, the answer is automatically no.
2300	Islamic radicals are not the only groups that use violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. Anyone striking civilian targets with violence with the intent to send a message or spread fear should be considered a terrorist organization.
2301	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By starting fires in civilian areas, the group fits the definition of terrorists.

2305	Just like any other private schools, religious schools' earn money from their own students. This money goes directly to them and is not subsidised in any way. The money given to private institutions like these is like giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity. You don't know what they are going to do with it and how it will benefit their students.

2310	If you can properly discipline your child, then there's no reason to cut his/her hair as a punishment. If does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did was wrong.
2311	You don't exactly see how cutting someone's hair, like a child for example, would straighten them out. For most kids, it wouldn't really teach them a "valuable" lesson. I can tell you based on personal experience. If you can properly discipline your child, then there's no reason to cut his/her hair as a punishment. If does come to punishing them, there are better ways for them to learn what they did was wrong.

2315	Crime and punishment of both criminals and those that are born to them is based on the fact that they are criminals. If the police is not allowed to protect the population from criminal gangs, regular citizens will take up arms to protect themselves. While it is understandable, it is not good for the rule of law. Therefore, 'political correctness' must not be used to prevent police from doing their jobs and keeping the public safe.

2325	It's a pretty ghetto place. They had to break up a fight at around 11pm. There are only about 25 people here. I'm looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at a table. It's not a bad place for drinking but the food isn't great so I don't think we'll be coming back for another girls night.
2326	It's really ghetto. The place had to break up a fight around 11pm and there were only around 25 people here. I was also looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at a table. It's not because it's from alcohol if you ask me.... the server was alright but we had a few other issues. The place probably wouldn't be open for almost a week until they fixed them up. The service was slow for a weekend night, but I think this place probably won't be open for a while because they won't be even replenishing stock.
2327	We were a little slow to start with and when we did we had a problem with a patron and it didn't make the week as fun. However, the food was great and the server was friendly. The drunken rant wasn't so impressive.

The server was fine, they were out of three kinds of tacos, which is pretty strange for a Friday night. Service was a little slow for a weekend night.
2330	My family always ordered from #109 for over 10yrs, our house number ends 4949 and I, Sherie Arvayo, call from my cell, just lately the persons who answer the phone are very disrespectful when they can't hear what I'm saying and who ever answered at 4:59pm today rudely hung up on me. 2 months ago they messed up our order and whomever the manager was must have taught the employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. This is about the 4th time the employees are very disrespectful and mean. We decided to go with Papa John's for at least their employees are professionals and friendly.... I hope they close this store because you never know if or what they would put in our pizza!!!!
2331	I'm glad that you and your family always ordered from # 109 because only at this place your employees are professionals and they will act and talk professionally. Your family's order may have been wrong because the manager did teach their employees how to act and talk unprofessionally. They call at 4.59 pm just to rudely hang you up on your cell. We hope that in the future the manager will be given a training because it was the manager who taught the employees to act unprofessionally.

2335	Usually we have a good experience here. On this latest occasion I was disappointed with the service. Food was fine but the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server will prevent me from coming here for quite awhile. I expect the serving of the food to be fast and professional. They did mention that it would take an hour before we were served, so perhaps that is the timeframe we had in mind. Also, there is plenty of room between each table for conversation. As it was a Saturday night, perhaps the staffing was not adequate. Please be more aware of how many you are serving at a given time to avoid waiting.

The lack of attentiveness was not enough to drive us away, but the overall demeanor was disrespectful. What really fries me is when the bussing of the tables is slow. And that was the case here. Also, instead of letting us relax and order drinks the server took our drink and dinner orders at the same time. Take the drink order first and let us look at the menus, please. It was a Saturday night (early) and perhaps the staffing was not sufficient.

2340	My go to dish is the carne asada fries or their chicken chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. I could eat here everyday. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them. I always forget to go in and take advantage but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. You want to spend a dime for great food, this is your place
2341	I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in such a very long time. It's family owned, and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients is so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata.

2345	Teenage bartender was rude, short, and immature.  She was eating at a table and was the only bartender, which meant having to go to her to get drinks.  There were very few people despite it being a Saturday evening, and I understand why!    We asked for chips and salsa, she told us they only have nachos.  We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa, which she brought for us.  So..hmmmm..I guessed they have chips (nachos) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her to bring us another bowl of chips and another bowl of salsa.  She told us, ''it's not on the menu''.  I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes.  I went next to the manager to request one of those items, it was simply the chef who was literally next to me, he said he would order it for us.  I just can't believe how blatantly dishonest her behavior was.   This time we ordered a plain orzo pasta, there was basil on the side but we didn't use it, we ordered a natural so we got some.  This time the bill came to $65.97 - NACHOS & SALSA  So....hell nah!  NEVER WANT TO GO BACK!
2346	People usually have a bad time because they're asked to go to a place they aren't familiar with and they don't want to be rude and order something they don't want to order.  The response that the bartender gives to people will always be what she gets.

We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us.  So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was "it's not on the menu".  I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, she told me I was being confrontational.  I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes.    We will NEVER go there again.

2350	Our friend had Mac & Cheese with Wings, and said it was really good. She even got some wings for dessert, cuz her man loves them. The outdoor seating was super chill, but that day they allowed some kids in, so they were definitely obnoxious. I think it's super cool and chill place to hang and drink.

2352	My friend went over for drinks. We had the Mac & Cheese and she said it was really good. She even got some wings and she said she liked them too. The outdoor seating was great that day. However, there were some kids that were allowed in that day. Maybe they had gotten home from school. Other than that I think it is super cool and fun place to hang out and drink.

2355	Teachers, having only someone else to teach their students, may want to step away from covering all topics until they feel confident with their own knowledge of a subject. A class room could afford to be creative without stifling or crushing individuality.
2356	The last thing which a school should do is to hinder the creativity expression of its still-developing students.
2357	The last thing which a school ought to do is to attempt to hinder the creative expression of their still-developing children.
2358	The last thing which a school should do is attempt to hinder the creative expression of the students' still-developing minds.
2359	It is not school work. It is, in essence, a duty that the schools and the parents of the students have because it is a duty of the parents to assist their children in growing up in a healthy manner. The schools are there to assist these students in becoming educated and
2360	They show kids expressions and makes them to cling to the computer instead of learning anything from it.
2361	it shows kids expressions and unforms. Dose not show is it
2362	It does not show kids facial expressions and inflexions.
2363	TV shows don't show kids expressions, it does not show children's facial expressions.
2364	It doesn't show kids expressions because they are very intense, and things like that.
2365	the controlling person's behavior should be done in the childhood but not in the age when students become adults.
2366	In point of view it doesn’t make no sense to wear uniform at school. Everyone prefers clothes that they think are comfortable but everyone isn't equal for this, so wearing uniform wouldn't be the best solution for this problem. School uniform can be used sometimes, maybe for sports practice, or for very crucial activities like inspectors' work, in spite of it, a uniform is something limit school's freedom, and this is surely something that needs to be changed.
2367	Even though limiting people’s freedom can become very serious problem, followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers, what about the controlling person’s behavior? It’s better to do it in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
2368	One of the most important and strategic goal for students is to learn to respect people aged 16-18. Students should not wear uniform as an restriction on their free choice and often they can go beyond their parents' expectations about their free rights and also they cannot adapt to the new situation. In addition, limiting the freedom of persons to help them to understand limits of human rights can help them to become valuable human beings who are responsible citizens.
2369	We should limit youngsters age of wearing school uniforms to 14. People aged 16-18 don't like any limits and sometimes restricting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about controlling person's behavior - it should be done in childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
2370	The idea that wearing uniform makes students learning at school is nonsense. Students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money to buy uniform. There is no link between wearing uniform and school results.
2371	Uniform sucks. Wearing uniform doesn't mean a better learning at school (students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money to buy uniform). NO CONNECTION BETWEEN UNIFORM WORN N SCHOOL RESULTS
2372	uniform sucks because wearing uniform doesn't mean better learning at school (students go to school to learn to prepare for their future, not to waste money to buy uniform ).. There is no connection between uniform worn and school results.

2374	There is no statistical connection between the wearing of uniforms and the results of schools.
2375	Anyone who says Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously hasn't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time. It is a known issue and a simple restart will fix it.

Who needs em!)

The only memory issues I've come across are when opening multiple windows or leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix.) If someone argues that IE7 over firefox, then I say whatever, I don't think Firefox is the best program out there (pun intended) but here are some good points to make, Firefox 2 has a new search function and even allows you to customize the buttons, Firefox is similar to IE 7 but not as customizable (your choices are very limited), open multiple windows can bring about serious memory leaks, Firefox has a new focus system which is better (though not as good as IE 6) but if you are an artist or programmer or graphic designer like myself you really don't need it, Firefox has a new HTTPS API, this is a good thing because it will provide an additional security layer... or so they say, IE has had a similar thing for years, but it won't probably
2380	Internet Explorer is better than Firefox because Internet Explorer has proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
2381	There's no reason at all why anyone could say IE is better. It is proven that Firefox is safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
2382	Now Firefox 3.5 is the latest version of Firefox and comes with a new name called Safari
2383	Firefox is more popular but there is no scientific, legal, or technical reason why it is better than IE.
2384	There is no reason that anyone could say Internet Explorer is better. Firefox is proven to be safer, faster, and sleeker. You can customize it to look any way you want, and you can add any functionality you can think of. It even has a more original name!
2385	Although what I mean is that when she is with a man, and he does not have a girlfriend, don't respond to it like an end justifies the means. Go ahead and spank her, cuss her, call her names, and any more means of hitting her with out having a boyfriend. Also, she won't ever wanna be with me no matter what. When a woman wants you, she will say it. I will be more than happy to accept her no matter what and decide that she is my best option and that I love her. But if she gets cold feet, come on and tell her, I'm sorry but I don't feel like it any more. And if you really want to be with her, see how I feel. Don't fight the facts, because reality, is what you are fighting. I would tell him that my boyfriend, is not supposed to be there. Then, you're dating your mother's boyfriend right? So I'll be there
2386	That is not something that anyone would do, it's something that she did and it might not be that easy for everyone to tell someone about it. I don't think that her mom would really expect her to and if she did say anything to her mom, I think she'd have to hide it from her. I'm pretty sure that it's not that easy for someone to say anything to their parents about that kind of thing.
2387	Of course not, Absolutely not. It's something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would do. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!

2390	If my spouse commits murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone he knew what he was doing and it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.

I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone he knew what he was doing so there was no way that it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in my one I love.
2393	But I would not turn in my spouse because killing is wrong and there is no forgiveness for murderers. If his mistake is making millions of dollars but those millions will be made by everyone who supports him and contributed to his success. For example, he could rape a child and this would be the end of that person, but millions would make out so well with his father and anyone else who brags about supporting his father.

2395	Have any of you noticed that the people against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That's clearly proves that books are much better than TV because TV rots the brain.

2400	There can be no argument as to India's potential to rule the world, because have you seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in some foreign country getting Nobel prizes while the others are just stuck ups who don't do anything and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!
2401	First of, India does not have the potential to rule the world because have you seen the people?

Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!

Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!

2405	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A mean father could come in gain your trust and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
2406	Having fatherless kids means there are no heartache from him. A lousy father can come in and make you trust him and then walk out. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. But to me, having a father who does nothing is an absence, and both way, he knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
2407	The more time passed and the more I was able to understand his flaws, the worse he became. He refused to hold me, and even if I begged for a hug, he yelled. After I kept trying to hug him even though he didn't like it, he spit on me. I felt so bad, and wished I wasn't the one who had to do everything to get his attention and make him stop being so sadistic. Now I think I would have been a better father than he was.
2408	If a father does not give you any practical advice, then by definition he is a looney drunk or could be a bad father. If you only know his absence and not his nature, then by definition he has no sense of humor, or is hateful. I think being fatherless would be a bad thing because the only thing you have to do is be there when he doesn't exist, and that would leave you with nothing to do. If you had an absent father you might live that life for awhile without the disadvantages.
2409	Being fatherless is better than being fathered because you can only have heartaches from him when he's there to deny it. A bad father could come in and take your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who doesn't do a thing is in itself an absence because he either knows nothing about you, and you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
2410	Being fatherless is better because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and it makes you a better person and a better father.
2411	Being fatherless would be a good thing because then you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.
2412	It does not matter because you can imagine your father as you want him to be, and it makes you a better person and a better father.
2413	Anyone who has a father does not need to be fatherless. There are men who raise a child without affection and when they grow up this affect them and the relationship with their children gets worse. Some men like lousy fathers because they can do whatever they want with their sons. But a good father is the one who loves and is there for you when you need him the most.
2414	Being fatherless is better because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and it makes you a better person and a better father.
2415	Being fatherless is more depressing than having a lousy father. But for me, i prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case, i am in the middle of this two choices. that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.
2416	Being fatherless is not bad or depressing... but having a lousy father is definitely a very bad reason to never care for the child.
2417	I think it would hurt me more if my father was not here to support me. But I understand why my father left. I would still like to see my father and understand if I cannot have him. It would be very depressing to feel like my father is just behind us doing something else. If I have a father but he is not here in this country then I am still a fatherless child. In this case I am in the middle of both of these possibilities, because I have a father but he is not here in the country, I understand him for leaving home. But I still need him here for support.
2418	Both being fatherless and having lousy fathers is depressing. But for me, I will prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if I had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case, I am in the middle of this two choices, that is because I have a father but he is not here in this country, I understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But I still need him here to support me.
2419	It is ok if you have a fatherless childhood, but you should feel better if you have a lousy father because it would hurt you the most if you had both situations. So if you have a father but he is not around, it is ok to not care about him. But if you have a lousy father, that makes it all the more important to have a father in your life. In this case, I am in the middle of choosing whether or not to have a father in my life because I have a father but he is not here.
2420	When Raffles came back from a tour, he changed Farquhar's set rules and concepts. This can show Raffles' kindness to the people.
2421	Singapore changed the concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs, showing Raffles to have taken care of the people.
2422	When Raffles returned after a period of time, he changed the rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the people's needs. This can show that Raffles cares for the people.
2423	When Raffles came back after a period of time, he changed the rules and concepts Farquhar had set according to the peoples needs. This can show that he cares for the people.
2424	One of Raffles' changes after returning from his overseas trip was that Farquhar had set rules that addressed the people's needs. This can show Raffles cared for the people.
2425	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
2426	Even though it is true that Raffles didn't work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he was going to put the plans, ideas and take action on his own. The reason why his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen is because he was going to make further plans by himself.
2427	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Therefore it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
2428	Even though it is true that Raffles did not work closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Hence it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas.
2429	Even though Raffles didn't work very closely with the population to develop Singapore, he provided plans, ideas and was going to put them in action by himself when his superiors ordered him to Bencoolen. Therefore it was common sense for Raffles to leave his subordinate to finish his ideas
2430	If I am being very honest to myself the founder's of Singapore are Princes Sanila Utama and Raffles. In point of fact, for those who say that Fatah Alqos was seen island first he isnt unless they got info from Raffles. Raffles was given credit for this progress because he was able to get the assistance and cooperation from the rulers of Arabia, Africa and the Pacific Ocean. So, let me repeat the question why the name "Raffles Institution", "Raffles Hospital", "medical clinics" are still what they are called, Why?
2431	FOUNDER is not a person who "discovers" a place. As I'm saying the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore! (this for some who say Farquhar saw the island first). And I do know that Farquhar has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work. But let me remind you that being Raffles' "assistant" he still had to consult Raffles and Raffles had all authority over Singapore. Therefore he was given credit. Then I would like to ask you a question why then does the name "Raffles institution" "Raffles hospital" "Raffles medical clinics" 
2432	APOLLO ON THE moon was not discovered by any "scientist". The discovery of the moon was made by the people at the time. The moon was one of the things that impacted the public opinion of the Americas.
2433	founder is not a person who "discovers" a place if the prince Sanila Utama found Singapore, then Faruqar can claim he found it. Also, Farqhar has been very involved in this helping out and sometimes even does all the work. Let me remind you that Raffles is still a servant and he still has to consult with Raffles. Therefore, Raffles was given credit for all things. So why is the name Raffles Institution, Raffles Hospital, Raffles Medical Clinic.
2434	Founder is not a person who "discovered" a place if so, the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of Singapore. And I do know that Farquhar had been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work. Let me remind you that he was still given credit as 'Assistant'. Then I would like to ask you a question why then does the name "RAFFLES INSTITUTION" "RAFFLES HOSPITAL" "RAFFLES MEDICAL CLINICS" use the "RAFFLES" name, when they were renamed to the OWONG INSTITUTION. with the knowledge that Raffles used all kinds of trickery and intimidation against the Chinese and the begat'serfdom' of the Singaporean individuals).
2435	Creativity is not directly correlated with what we think, but instead reflects what our inner self is trying to tell us...Which is always something different than what we thought.
2436	It's wrong when it's not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about. But it tends to screw up their reality.
2437	Both porn and playing with sex toys or anal sex are wrong because people can become addicted to porn, and people need to be thinking about the consequences of these. So, they become insecure about other people and mistreat women. Also people who are addicted to porn expect all women to act like porn stars and fuck like porn stars and are not about sex, instead of enjoying a real sexual relationship with another person. But porn can cause dysfunction in relationships and turn relationships into sexual games.
2438	Moderate porn is not wrong when it's done in the right way and in the right context and in the right environment and with the right person. But when the person is addicted, it can lead to problems like lack of intimacy, mistreatment of women and a negative perception of women.
2439	When pornography is done in moderation it is morally acceptable. But when you are addicted to it then you tend to view all women in a negative manner and mistreat women in an unreasonable way. Also people are addicted to porn and expect all women to look like pornstars and act like pornstars when in reality that is not what sex is all about but it tends to screw up your actuality.
2440	The thought of this person getting off on other women makes me feel suicidal.
2441	Being hopeless in love can make you suicidal because you are thinking of your loved one's possible infidelity with another woman.
2442	When you love someone you are in an emotionally strong relationship. This is not the same thing as dating. A strong emotional relationship does not turn into a sexual relationship.
2443	Wearing a condom is important for using contraceptives.
2444	it makes me a bit sad thinking of the one I love most getting off on other women.
2445	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. The invention of radiometric dating was not until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates that Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
2446	When Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata, radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
2447	As stated in the story, while radiometric dating has improved, it's still calibrated to fit the dates that Charles Lyell came up with. To say that radiometric dating is scientific rigor is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
2448	At the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
2449	If the astronomical method is not an accurate tool when they are using historical rocks to determine a date (given the uncertainty that comes with dating through observation), shouldn't the radiometric method be used instead? Radiometric dates come off as more accurate because they calibrate the measurements to results coming off from the astronomical dating technique. If the dating methods are not very accurate, then would they be useful for dating the earth's creation?
2450	To believe in The Big Bang is fine, but what caused it? If you believe in 'The Big Bang' and you believe that the universe was created because certain gases reacted with each other, where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think the universe came to be. The point is that it cannot have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
2451	An objection to a universe being created by God may be 'If there is no creator, then why can't everything in the universe just come to be by itself?' But the reply is simple. The Big Bang theory is not proof that an intelligent, personal God created the universe. This is not true when it comes to the 'big bang'. The Big Bang was not caused by an intelligent, personal God; it was simply an extraordinary event in the universe. The 'big bang' was such an event. The Biblical creation account is designed to provide a scientific explanation of how a perfectly designed universe came to be.
2452	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, where did those gases come from? The universe can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
2453	There should have to be a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
2454	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in "The Big Bang", then that's fine. But what caused it?

The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.
2455	After the Industrial Revolution, the change of the environment placed light on the moths.
2456	In case, both the moths were present on the trees to begin with. Then in the industrialization, the environment changed and became dark.
2457	the darkness was selected during the Industrial Revolution when the environment changed.
2458	What I meant was that there were both colorful moths present at the time of the observation - both colored moths were on the trees to begin with. Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution.
2459	On the occasion of the change of environmental condition, both moths were on the trees to begin with. Then, the darkness came because of the Industrial Revolution.
2460	In the 21'st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is not evolution. That's what evolution is. It always has been.
2461	In the 21st century, we have come to a point where the only way we can evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.
2462	In the 21st century, we have come to a point where the only way we can evolve is to start creating. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.

2465	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that has appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 100,000 years old?
2466	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
2467	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that has appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when it really is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
2468	What if a higher power did not exist and life and the universe and even death and everything as we know it is only 10 thousand years old. Would we change the way we treat it or would we still celebrate the holy mother goddess because we have not figured that out yet?
2469	Could a higher power have created a perfect world that appears to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
2470	Spam and adware seem more compatible with Internet Explorer than with any other browser.
2471	Adware and spam seem to be so much more compatible with Internet Explorer.
2472	IE and adware seem to be so much more compatible than spam.
2473	There is no reason for compulsion when it comes to the computer. Everyone uses their personal choice, including the Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android
2474	Spam and adware seems to be compatible with Internet Explorer.
2475	I think Physical education should be mandatory for everyone because even in today’s time no one has access to any physical activity. If they don’t get physical activity they will not burn as much fat as they accumulate, thus they will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because some of the people mostly just stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
2476	 Physical Education is important because it is needed to have exercise. If they don't have an exercise then they do not get to keep the weight from growing. They need to be more strict on their exercise to keep everyone healthy and fit. Also, girls should learn more of the importance of exercise because some of them are only interested in being there now and you don't want to keep someone from developing and becoming there very person.
2477	People should be stricter during those classes of physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for their health!
2478	Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving!

2480	If Czechoslovakia was a country with abundant physical education it must be taught but it must not be a compulsory class because some of us are not well prepared for the extensive physical exercises that it requires.
2481	Of Cz Phys Ed should be taught but it shouldn't be compulsory because some of us are not fit for the extensive exercises performed.
2482	Physical education must be taught but it should not be compulsory because some of us aren't physically fit enough to do the extensive exercises.
2483	Physical education must be taught, but it should not be mandatory because not everyone is capable of performing all the extensive exercises.
2484	most physical education must be taught but it mustn't be compulsory because there are some people that aren't physically capable to do extensive exercises.
2485	This could also lead to increase childhood obesity, because kids are not pushed in their homes to have any physical activity.
2486	This is just a solution to the problem of obesity that may occur as a result of this amazing invention of technology. Children can develop positive traits such as leadership, discipline and help children with childhood obesity. This is just a small portion of a child's development to becoming a good adult. It could help or it could help the epidemic of obesity spread.
2487	This is a good incentive to have more children because kids learn to enjoy outdoor activities and works for childhood obesity as well. It is just the fact that kids are not forced to have any physical activity at home.
2488	This will help children learn to act and behave well, like the responsibility and self discipline. It can also help fight against childhood obesity. It is just the fact that the children are not encouraged by their homes or family to have any form of physical activity.
2489	The effect of sports will be that students will learn teamwork, discipline and will become healthy. One could also help with childhood obesity. It is just the fact that kids are not pushed at home to have any physical activity.
2490	Definitely all those obese kids need excersise and is a whole part of life, course it should be mandatory.
2491	In point of view. you need to find fun and life is not all about food. You should do regular exercise and life is not only about food but more about other things.
2492	Definitely all overweight kids need some exercise and it's a whole part of life. Obviously it should be mandatory.
2493	Definitely all those overweight children need to do exercise and it's a whole part of life. Of course, it should be mandatory.
2494	Definitely all obese kids need excersise, and it's a whole part of life of course it should be mandatory.
2495	I agree that children should learn healthy lifestyle. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so there will be less people in our country who are less likely to be obese.
2496	Children should learn how to live healthy lifestyles. There should be stricter curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
2497	My point is that if children were not allowed to go to bars when they grow up, they would be prevented from drunken fights and accidents. Less deaths caused by alcohol would be a problem. Also, less children would be allowed to eat red meat or fast food because of the dangers of these foods. Additionally, if children were forbidden from going to bars and eating fast food, the majority of us adults would also follow that example. A lot less people
2498	If schools were stricter they might teach kids how to live a healthy lifestyle, so less obese children.
2499	Children should learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. There should be strict curriculums that schools are required to follow so less people in our country are less likely to be obese.
2500	Yes! Our kids are too out of shape for the most part and eat too much junk.
2501	Yes! Our kids are so out of shape for the most part and eat too much junk.
2502	yes! our children are so out of shape in most part and eat too much junk food.
2503	YEAH! Our kids are SO out of shape for the most part and eat too much junk food.
2504	Yes! Our kids are out of shape. They eat too much junk food.
2505	Singapore was founded by Stamford Raffles, but the implementation of the idea was left to Farquhar. Therefore, I believe Farquhar is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the idea man before Singapore was founded, but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
2506	There is no doubt that Stamford Raffles was the idea man of Singapore. His contribution was minimal. In fact, in November 1782, Raffles was summoned from Batavia to get married to Anne White who was the daughter of Sir Stamford Strange, a British Agent at Tanjong Kapurau. They were married in Bencoolen. Before the marriage, Raffles was asked to be Governor of the Straits Settlement. We don't know much about the contribution of Farquhar but he was the better administrators. In fact, he stayed in Singapore for more than 40 years and saw the great improvement in its institutions and economy after he was appointed to be the Governor. He
2507	In point of Stamford Raffles was the foundation for the idea, but the implementation was left to Farquhar so I believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was only the idea man before the foundation, but he was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
2508	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea, but the implementation was left to John Farquhar so I believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding, but was summoned to Penang and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
2509	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar. So i believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.
2510	That is fine. I believe in God and evolution.
2511	In point of view, I believe in God and Evolution.
2512	God created the first things; I don't think Adam and Eve were really human, maybe single celled. But man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures, man. Those things God created evolved to fit their surroundings. There is proof of this, you cannot deny this. I do not know if we came from monkeys or not.
2513	God created the first things which then evolved to fit their surroundings. There is proof of this. You cannot deny this. I do not know if we came from monkeys or not.
2514	This video was made showing that God created animals. It must be shown that they Evolved, not that God made them that way.
2515	There is not God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments, not in an attempt to reach anyone. Sorry.
2516	There is not a God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments. Sorry.
2517	There is not a god. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments. Sorry.

2520	Define order and detail, in existence isn't a BMW, you are falling for the old watch maker's argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," and equally well written.
2521	Order and detail. Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," and equally well written.
2522	Let me sum up. There is a natural selection process and nature operates by reproduction and evolution. You have convinced me. We are in the middle of a reptilian invasion. Long live well ordered an detailed.
2523	Order and detail. It’s important to recognize that this material is living and capable of selection and change. Occasionally, this system will produce something with design characteristics not found in the system. Just look at the Devils. There are no ‘watch maker’ arguments, there is only the observation that human tourels are self tuning materials. In some instances there is more art than some architectural architectures.
2524	Being that you've done so much to damage the planetary climate, you do not have the right to claim the existence of unnatural factors being responsible for the observed trends.
2525	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me. Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day on my own but also have a great boyfriend, who we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i am lucky!) times a week, who uses porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!

2530	NO. I am a female who watches porn, it does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn, I think it is natural for people to have sexual desires, if people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it, but people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
2531	NO. I am a female who watches porn, it does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn, I think its natural for people to have sexual desires, if people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.

2534	I am a female and it is very natural for people to have sexual desire. However, if people are uncomfortable with the idea, they should simply not watch it. However, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
2535	Volunteering at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me, when I help advance the common good, I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others, it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit, you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
2536	We should all be helping each other more. It's not only a favor, it's actually helping oneself and the world at large. If we all did this we'd have a better world. We can do this in a personal way by helping other people or in an official way.
2537	It is very useful to be selfless. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or something else.

2538	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so good that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
2539	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
2540	While striving for the common good you can change the world forever. Allot of people have succeeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.

2544	You can make advancements for the common good while striving to make changes. All over the world there have been people who have created truly beautiful things, who made large advances for the common good and they are honored for it. Our nation could benefit from numerous bold changes so the common good truly exists. Many of our past and present politicians have used this power for greed rather than the common good. They have caused our society to separate and divided. They hurt people and many lives have been lost because of this for the sake of the power and the position they hold.
2545	Seeking to advance the Common good allows doors to be opened and barriers to be broken, and after a journey or series of considerate acts one can have an less-difficult time pursuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. The word for this debate is sacrifice. How much would a person really "sacrifice" for his or her neighbor without being blinded by the light beamed from selfishness. No matter where a person is in thier life.... Remember, you may not know what they did (or) what they gave up to be there!

2550	Clothing is usually prepared for later on in life. It's ensured that no unsuitable clothing is worn.
2551	Students learn how to make use of the different materials they have found and what clothing is suitable for them.
2552	Clothing wasnt there for our ancestors. Some primitives wore animal skins or what else they got.
2553	Clothing that is too fancy or too plain should be discarded. People should change and change clothes if they don't wear them anymore.
2554	They prepare people for the clothes they may have to wear later on in life. They ensure that no unsuitable clothing is worn.
2555	I try to see things in both ways. At first, I prefer a fatherless father, but at a point where I am growing up, I think it's better to have a lousy father instead of a fatherless father. The reason is that if I have a fatherless father, I will not have any father for me to look up, so I won't be able to learn anything about life. So it would be better to have a lousy father instead of a fatherless father because I would be ready for life and prepared.
2556	For people like me who are looking for father-less fathers, sometimes it is better to have a lousy father. In order to grow up and be ready for life, you have to learn about life. If you do not have an image or person to look up, life can become harder or not good.
2557	I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes I'll rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because to grow up and be ready for life, you have to learn about life and if you don't have an image or person to look up in life could become hard or not good.
2558	This sort of double down on parental responsibility needs to be put into perspective because obviously parents do a lot of things and don't know everything. But, after all, we are still raising our children and if we are complaining about their lack of discipline when we're the ones who are failing that is just wrong.
2559	Although I rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.
2560	Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father, you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a lousy father, his going to love you no matter what.
2561	It's better to have a fatherless childhood then not to have a father at all. Even if you have a fatherless childhood, you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a fatherless childhood, his going to love you no matter what.
2562	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life? 
2563	It is better to have a father who is an unlovable person, than to have no father at all. Even if you have no father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better. Even if you don't have a father he will still love you no matter what.
2564	Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father, you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better." Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what.
2565	If you haven't lived your life with a good father who can support you in case of problems, you should try to do something about it. Whether he's lousy or not, it doesn't matter at all. You should tell your mother and ask her to help you. Just like you want to live with your mother, a father is also essential to the happy life of a son. It doesn't matter if he has no job or drinks or even lives in a different country, but he has to be there for you at some point. Be happy having a good father and that will go a long way when you get old. Have your mother support you and try to keep up with what he's doing and if you don't have a father yet, don't worry because there are ways to find him and get you to marry him.
2566	If I met my father for the first time today, I wouldn't live my life right if I didn't have lousy and bad father. Even though his job or life is not great, he is still a father and that's all that counts. Having a father is better than having no father at all because most fathers are good friends. So you can talk to them and they will understand your situation and how to support you at some time in your life.
2567	If I never met my father, I wouldn't live my life right. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had a lousy father, even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcoholic. Having a father means a lot especially if you're a boy, because most fathers are friends to you, so you can talk to them about your guy problems and they would understand the situation and just living with your mother you couldn't because she was a woman and her views were different than a guy. Whether or not the father is good or bad, he will always be there for you at some point in your life.
2568	I wouldn't live my life right if I never met my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcoholic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you wouldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
2569	If I didn't have a father in my life, I wouldn't live a good life because I would become an alcoholic, a thief, a traitor or a liar or the list could go on. Father always means so much, especially if it's a boy because most boys' fathers are their friends and their fathers will be there for them when they become old and they have problems. Whether it's a good or bad father they will always be there for them sometime in life.
2570	well with our water bottle consumption on the planet earth, we could cover all of mexico 3 times, of could that would be a lot of "rich" in their mind Mexicans.
2571	The amount of water bottles that the planet produces, would cover the entire country of Mexico 3 Times. This would be an "harmless" joke for Mexicans.
2572	With our water bottle consumption on the planet earth, we could cover all of Mexico 3 Times, and you would be, in your minds, a "rich" Mexican.

2574	As of right now, we could cover all of Mexico with tap water!
2575	We have said that bottled water is convenient and it doesn’t mean that it is better than water from the tap. The problem with bottled water is that it contains micro and toxic particles that contaminate the water and lead to serious health issues.
2576	You can buy water from vending machines for free and bottled water is actually cheaper.
2577	Like most bottled waters, Dasani water is about as close to tap water as you can get and it's significantly cheaper than municipal water. So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?
2578	Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon. So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink?

2600	Water bottles are not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=103x34805.
2601	The big problem with drinking water in other contexts is that its energy consuming and water resources depleting. Don't dismiss the precious resource water.

2610	In my opinion, India cannot lead the world because of the unfair and wrong laws that India has. It is also because of the horrible corruption, which India has experienced for a long time.
2611	To say India cannot lead the world is to say that a newborn child cannot walk!! The rising India is a great country. We are getting better day by day!!
2612	To say that India cannot lead the world is to say that a newborn child can never walk. I agree that there are so many problems that the rising India is facing today but we are getting better day by day.
2613	Although India is not getting better all the time, it is getting better day by day.
2614	To say India cannot lead the world is to say that a newborn child can never walk. I agree that there are many problems that the rising India is facing. But we are getting better day by day.
2615	Firstly, when you read the information on this blog, I also have my own ideas on what India and Pakistan are doing. This is not the subject of this blog, but my own ideas. So if you want to make another topic, I have no objection. However, this article is a matter of debate on this website. So this is not my problem. The peoples of Pakistan and India are fighting this war in their homelands, but they are fighting for what? We can all see that in this world is thousands of hungry and poor people, and it is enough to watch them get beaten to death because of their differences and religion. And yet some rich people can come here and openly criticize them, criticize their religion, criticize all the fighting people who are involved in this war. So this is really a problem, but it has nothing to do with the war that Pakistan and India have been fighting. I hope you can understand my position in this article. I understand the
2616	Greek is a form of power that doesn't work for the USA nor for any other country. I'm not saying the government should give up all the things that are important to us, but I'm also not saying they should spend the whole thing on Greece.
2617	Hi all of you.................... this is a new girl joining the press who are in favor of this argument.......... those who are in opposition to this topic.......... I ask you one thing: please think before you talk about India's potential... because the wealth that the foreigners are enjoying now, are the looted one for India. The other foreign countries are more developed than us because it's India people who are using their brains and making the foreign countries develop....

The other foreign countries are more developed than us because it is the Indian people who are using their brains and making the foreign countries developed.
2620	If india leads the world then many countries will depend on scientists and most of the employees in every country will be Indians.

2625	Religious people use the same argument: you can't prove he doesn't exist! You can't disprove a negative. Meaning, you can't prove something is not there, which already is not there.
2626	People use the same argument: you can't prove he doesn't exist!!! YOU CANNOT disprove a negative. Meaning, you can't prove something is not there, which is already not there.
2627	Religious people use the same argument: you cannot prove he does not exist. You cannot disprove a negative, so you cannot prove that he exists.
2628	Religious people are always using the same argument: you cannot prove he doesn't exist!!! You cannot disprove a negative. Meaning, you cannot prove something is not there, which already is not there.
2629	People who are religious use the same argument that they can't prove that God doesn't exist because they cannot disprove a negative. It means that you cannot prove something is not there, but you can prove something is not true.
2630	Go and see a movie. It would be funny to see a movie called God is a S**t.
2631	God isn't playing a game. Really, so get over it you dumb believers of God.
2632	It's stupid to believe in a God that will have an omniscient, all-powerful, all-good God punish evil or be good to you? If that's what he is
2633	God isn't flipping real, so get over it, dumb believers of god.
2634	God doesn't flip anything, so get over it, you dumb belivers of God.
2635	Whether or not spanking should be used, or how strictly it should be used, is a valid argument. I believe that spanking should only be used when it's a last resort for parents to keep a child safe.
2636	Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
2637	Spanking can be a useful tool in cases where it serves as a rehabilitation but I am against it as a punishment.
2638	I think spanking should be an option but I don't believe it should be the first option.
2639	Spanking should be an option, but I believe it should be an option, not the only option.
2640	That is what corrective discipline is for. I don't think he will make the same mistake twice, but it should be done if needed and it shows that he understands and knows what he did wrong and hopefully it will only happen rarely.
2641	It is important that children understand that disobedience leads to being punished and you should provide them with a reason why they should behave accordingly. In this case, you would not have to spank them, but you would have to explain to them that being a bully in school will bring bad consequences.
2642	Children must know that if they do something wrong, they will be punished. I believe that spanking children should be implemented. Children must know what their mistake was and not repeat it, it should be a life lesson.
2643	Therefore, spanking them shows them what they have done is wrong and if they do not want the feeling of a but woppen, they will not make the same mistake twice.
2644	If a child didn't want the feeling of a butt wop, then he/she wouldn't make the same mistake twice.
2645	There are a few people who have a relationship with Christ. They do believe in it.
2646	I have a personal relationship with God or Christ. I do believe.
2647	I do have a personal relationship with Christ. I do believe that he is the Savior of the world, but my
2648	Yes, I have a personal relationship with Christ. I do believe he died to save me.
2649	I'm a believer, I think.
2650	I think the world would be a hell if Christianity didn't exist. Actually, I can imagine a world without Christianity, it would be hell.
2651	Doesn't have to be christianity, you can believe in something that works the same way. God.
2652	Christianity is the most important belief I have. I can't imagine life without it. In fact, hell would exist.
2653	I'm Christian of course. Can't imagine life if I didn't believe in God. Actually I could, it would be hell.
2654	At some point in the history, Christians were absolutely justified in killing all others. Now, it seems like a pretty awful thing to do. Who knows if the Bible ever was presented in a way that supported it, but I don't think any
2655	This is just wrong. We should not insult whom we believe in. We do not need to know what you people think.
2656	This is just wrong, we shouldn't insult who we believe in. We do not need to know what you people think, so please stop making hateful comments against our religion.
2657	This is a wrong point of view and should not be used if you do not believe in what they say.
2658	We should not insult our belief and we don't need to know what you people think
2659	This is wrong. We should not insult who we believe in. We do not need to know what you people think about our beliefs and religious practice.
2660	This is the dumbest debate I have ever seen. How did we get so perfect were the earth and sun and moon is in the right spot and bodies function perfectly and are hands made distinctively. Because we were made after his own image.
2661	This is the most idiotic debate i have ever seen. How did we get so perfect with the earth, sun, and moon in the right place and bodies functioning perfectly? Are hands made distinctly? Because we were made after his own image.
2662	This is the most idiotic debate that I have ever seen! How do you tell me? How did we get so perfect? The earth and sun and moon are in the right place and bodys functions are perfectly running. Hands are made distinguishedly. We were created after his own image.
2663	How can you tell me please, how did we get so perfect. How the earth and sun and moon are in the right spot and our bodies function perfectly, and our hands are made distinctly? Because we were made after his own image.
2664	How can you say that we are so perfect because the earth is in the right spot, the sun is in the right spot, and the moon is in the right spot, and our body functions perfectly? You can't be perfect because your made after God's own image. Why the hell would you have ANY control on how your planet works?? Your sooo stupid, and disgusting. Just hold your damned hands down and enjoy a blessed day on this grate blessed planet. Why so hard on yourself? When you failed in a SCR test you were not you to
2665	People should not hit their kids because it will be considered a good thing to hit other people when the kids who are trying to hit back, will end up getting abused by others.
2666	Should not have any argument with students because sometimes kids get aggressive to others.
2667	People should not hit their kids because their kids will think it is okay to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
2668	Teachers should not hit their students because the student will think it's okay to hit someone else back like for example at school, they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
2669	Children should not hit their kids because the kids will think it is OK to hit someone else back like if they are at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.
2670	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Parents need to teach them different ways.
2671	Parents should not always use spanking to teach their children. There are different ways that can teach their children.
2672	No, because their parents need to teach them different ways.
2673	No, because it can do no good to get spanked for every single thing they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways to fix it.
2674	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.
2675	The new law that outlaws abortion really only applies to a child that is inside the womb. Whether you are killing the baby inside the womb or having it killed when it is still inside the womb, the lawsuit against you for murder are the same. This makes me think that the abortion law ought to go away altogether.
2676	For that matter, is a human life an absolute or is it based upon the child position inside the mother's womb? If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
2677	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? The situation changes drastically only if the child is inside the womb.
2678	Because it is inside the womb we are preventing legal action against a 6 month old baby that is lying in a pail because God forbid such a thing is even a thought in our heads.
2679	Personhood is absolutly. However, because the child is in the womb that it is harder to violate the rights of a pregnant woman.
2680	I choose life. Saving the life of an unmedicated fetus is killing the mother.
2681	Women should be allowed to kill their children if they wish. Legalizing abortion is allowing women to murder their children.
2682	I choose life, keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
2683	Those who are against life-supporting laws are supporting women who want to murder their own unborn child.
2684	I choose life. Keeping the law anti-choice is preventing women from murdering their own unborn human child.
2685	PE is a 200 years old policy that only has a barely lasting effect because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
2686	“No. PE has been around for more than 200 years ago. Today, the PE has barely taken any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign."
2687	PE has been around for long than the other policies like smoking control campaign. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect because of the influence of junk food and less time spent doing PE, especially because of the overpowering of knowledge of the younger generation. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
2688	 PE is a popular topic in schools because it has been around for more than 200 years. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect. It's primarily due to the fact that our kids are stuffing themselves up with junk food. What we should do is come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
2689	PE has been around since the 18th century. Today, the PE is barely taking any effect, mainly because of kids stuffing themselves up with junk food. We should come up with better ways to prevent obesity, such as a healthy eating campaign.
2690	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.

2692	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. It does improve blood circulation, sleep pattern, and posture. But except that, most of this class consists of sitting for 45 minutes and doing nothing. Even with the Wii sports class, that's still boring to most kids. Thank goodness for YouTube
2693	Physics is not used in the public education system, so all children who can afford to take classes learn about physical health as they play. I describe my physical education experience.

2695	There really aren't enough people with different stamina levels and having an extra person on the team wouldn't be beneficial because people like me don't have extra stamina for very intense exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
2696	We should all be made different. Some people have longer stamina and are suitable for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. Others have lesser stamina and are only suitable for less intensive exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
2697	Well, well well. I had muscle cramps all over when I was doing intensive exercises like running a long distance. You know, people are all made differently, some maybe have longer stamina and are suited for long distance runs and more intensive exercises. In contrast, people like me have lesser stamina and only suited for less intense exercises. Really, why force everyone to be the same?
2698	Well, everyone is different. Some people are more fit to run long distances and have more muscles to do exercises while others only have lesser strength. Why force everybody to be the same?
2699	Well well well I had muscle cramps all over when I am doing intensive exercises like running. You know, there are people who are not made like us, they have longer stamina and are suitable for running more long distances and sports with more intensity. Others, like me, are made of lesser stamina and we are suitable for less intensive exercises. But why force everyone to be the same?
2700	Physical education makes many problems. Also, we should not have to require physical education to graduate school.
2701	Physical Ed causes many problems. Also, we should not need Phys Ed to graduate school.
2702	physical education causes many problems such as injury and may not lead to college.
2703	Physical education causes many problems, so people should not need physical education to graduate high school.
2704	Physical education is a very expensive education program that cannot be used as a weight gain prevention for students. It causes many physical problems for students. Also, we shouldnt need physical education
2705	If someone wants to get married and have a relationship i do agree that it is alright, but in my opinion it's wrong that people put up boundaries so you can't do certain things in your life. It's up to you what you choose to do in the end. In some religions it's frowned on and I'm also frowned on it myself, but don't let this influence your life in any way. It's up to you.
2706	By no means is my opposition to LGBT beliefs, i believe they have rights under the law and that it's what people say not what they do that matters.
2707	Opinions should be free and everyone is free to do as they please. So, in my opinion i don't really care much about gay marriage. I think it's in a way wrong, but it doesn't really make a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself, but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion.

2709	Thank you for coming to our class today and I hope you enjoyed your tour of different parts of our high school. To continue, Please have your portfolio of examples of your work on your assignment. One of my students told me that this kind of homework comes from her sister who was a Spanish teacher. She said that she did it because her sister told her to because she had to do the same for her students. This type of homework also comes from experience. My grandmother had to take this course and had to also do a portfolio of sample work to pass her lesson plan test. So its a little bit of both experience and something to pass the test.
2710	If you feel that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting, then it's your right but if you feel that The man and women marriage is weird, then that's also your right. We are human and all of us have right to different point of views. So, it all depends on people. We have no right to go against them. Different people have different point of views. We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2711	We, the human beings, are very selfish creatures. We only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2712	We have no right to question people's perceptions. We have no right to go against people's perceptions. Different people have different point of views about things. We may find marriage between men and women weird but they may find it more perfectly natural than we do. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no right to question people's perceptions. We are selfish creatures because we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2713	We cannot decide if it is good or bad without respect for different peoples point of views. Different people have different opinions about it and there are some who find it weird and disgusting and go against it and there are some who find it as normal as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on individualists perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2714	We only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.
2715	Unfortunately, it's human nature to be selfish. This doesn´t always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes, in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better, but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful because only we live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe, your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
2716	We are always capable of being selfish and this doesn't always mean that you are a mean person. but an individual will try to help himself first. in a good situation, if you go out on your own personal pursuit you might advance the common good. Neither choice is better, but you can believe that going out on your own to achieve your personal pursuits might be more useful in our life. So, again, neither choice is better or worse. In other words, it really depends on how each individual perceives them.

Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
2718	You are free to pursue whatever you want to pursue. But how do you know if a personal pursuit is going to advance the common good?
2719	It is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you. It just means that you have to think about your selfish actions and see if they can be used in the service of the greater good.
2720	Before you help others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need. Having a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before you help others you must remember about yourself but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
2721	Personal achievement is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others, but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others, you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.

Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are in need.
2725	Focus on a personal pursuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you could help people here and there, donating a little bit of time and money, but in the end if ever in the position of power have money you could truly advance the common good.
2726	It seems like a lot of benefits and positive change could come from having more people with high levels of integrity in positions of power, and especially in positions of power in the government. Just improving people to go higher in society is a good thing. Yet only those that are high level politicians and lawyers can go higher, not such as low level politician and attorneys that could help people all over the country.
2727	If you dedicate your time and money to advance the common good it can only be beneficial to the people around you.
2728	In my point of view, I'd start building relationships with other people. I'd help people here and there and then in the end I would be in a position of power and then I could truly advance the common good.
2729	It's not about changing your life, it's about adding more meaning to it. The only way to make a meaningful difference in the world is to be passionate about it.
2730	No one enters suitably dressed, no one goes to court honestly. They rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.

2745	Global warming due to carbon emissions may sound like a fine-tuned mechanism for encouraging dramatic climate change, or an artificial correlation between them, but it's not. Contrary to our beliefs, carbon dioxide and other gases are a natural part of global climate change. We only see the effect of the mechanism that is purposefully built into them. The bigger problem is not the impacts it may bring, but the failure of mankind to accurately predict and control a universal mechanism that is of incredible complexity.
2746	Since Bush got away with tax-payer dollars funding faith-based initiatives, which is clearly unconstitutional but no politician will touch it in fear to be painted anti-church, there has been a movement in this country for more religious or power of the church. People don't realize how powerful the catholic church is. Do a little research and check out how wealthy they are. It will shock you. There is no way they are going to like China not 'obeying' their (not God's) rules.

2755	It can't be handled in one trial because theft is criminal and malicious prosecution and breach of contract are civil.  The DA won't touch them.  If you don't have a lawyer to bargain with the DA, then your best bet is to sit tight, gather your evidence, and defend yourself at the criminal trial.  If the DA wins, your case may be sunk; but if the DA loses you will be in a better position to sue the witness whom you believe lied.  You can sue in civil court, and you might be able to sue in Small Claims without a lawyer.

2760	See what we can do to enjoy the benefits in the short run. In the long run, we can look at how green our lives will be. We can calculate the benefits on earth’s resources in the long run.
2761	On the other hand, our agreement with china will make us secure but the other countries don't have the power to protect themselves. They can be polluting and producing cheap products, and then in the long run it will be better for US to invest in new technologies and create expensive products. As we are only one earth, so it won't matter if we do or do not sign the agreement.
2762	As a developing country, US should not have to make agreements with developed countries like Japan to protect the environment. The main issue is not putting US at risk of loosing the edge of industrial production. This is something that was not our fault. The main issue is the environmental agreements will be fully implemented in USA but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise to implement them, so third world countries will be polluting and producing cheap products while US will be investing in new technologies and creating expensive products, and we will reap the benefits if we sign the environmental agreement. The article doesn't really relate to the issue because it assumes that pollution will be produced equally in developing countries and developed countries and doesn't tell about what is going to happen with low-emissions technology. So it's a bit similar to text with extra information. So I've decided to leave it like this.
2763	Under Bush and Henry Wallace, the U.S.'s pledge to join the treaty would put Americans at risk for losing the technology edge that the U.S. has taken since the 1900s. This will likely restrict or stop American's industries from investing in technologies that are cleaner and save them time and energy, and will require a tremendous amount of money and effort that is not available to them. Other countries in the world will be able to produce products at much lower costs because they will have to adjust and put into place the same changes as America will have to do. Hence, the U.S. will be forced to pay much less for these products as it has to upgrade our current existing industries. But in the long run, the U.S. will reap the benefits. For example, using of product from other countries will lower the cost of American products, and eventually will reduce the prices of American products to a point where more people will get the benefits they would like. For example, smoking and drinking alcohol is much less costly if it is not part of the local culture. Once the prices go down, even more people will start to stop smoking and drink, making the US healthier and make it easier for Americans to lower their expenses. In the end, it will be the American economy that will benefit.
2764	Obama thinks that by signing the accord, US will lose the edge in industrial production because according to him the accord will put strict restrictions on emissions from various industries in America. To adhere to the standards in America, America needs to upgrade a large number of industries. Another reason is that these agreements will be fully implemented in America, but the other third world countries does not have the financial power or expertise to implement them. So the third world countries will be polluting and producing cheap products while US will be investing in new technologies and creating expensive products. However, in the long run America will reap the benefits if it signs the environmental accord because as we have only one earth we should all keep it clean.
2765	The Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50A, is very clear that if one uses another person's computer service (in this case, the other person's broadband connection) without permission, he has committed an offence.  I am unsure of the Act's legislation history but the law was around since 1993. From your post, I would assume that your friends made use of the other party's router fairly recently. As such, if they are caught, they can be prosecuted.  Arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile; it is common sense that the router has to belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone e.g. McDonald's, then one should know that any access would probably be going through a privately owned network.
2766	Computer misuse law in Nigeria is very clear about using somebody's computer. You should know that they belong to somebody and if you are not in a free wireless zone, you should know that any access to the Internet would probably be going through a privately owned network.
2767	If the computer is privately owned and the router belongs to someone else the owner of the router should know the location of the router's signal. If you were connected to his router you would know the signal location but you cannot argue that the router has an 'open' signal unless you are connected to that router. Therefore, arguing that the router is unsecured and/or does not have a unique SSID is futile.
2768	Usage of somebody else's ISP, which is a legal company (of course), is legal and should not be reported to law enforcement if you or your friends did not do anything wrong.

2770	While I agree that it was not ethical and was even insensitive, they were done in response to the suicide bombers, and they certainly don't respect others beliefs and truths.. what is the difference? You do not see all the people (muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting about the suicide bombers, when Islam, so we are told, is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs.. they are even killing fellow Muslims in Iraq but I don't see anybody protesting about that. I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
2771	You do not see all the people (Muslims) who are not suicide bombers protesting against the suicide bombers in Afghanistan and Iraq and other places, so we are told, Islam is a peaceful religion. It is the suicide bombers who have no respect for others beliefs.   I was referring to the suicide bombers and not Muslims as a whole.
2772	In point of view, whatever religion you follow, one group of people (the suicide bombers) act badly and make people's lives very difficult, but I do not see them protesting against such violent acts. I was talking about the suicide bombers. Also, I find your response very insensitive, and rather rude. You should not say such things about others' personal beliefs. You should respect others' beliefs and truths. Islam isn't that peaceful.
2773	Muhaimin?
2774	There is a lack of respect in that most Muslims not only don't respect the beliefs of other people, but they are even killing them. There is a lack of respect in that when Muslim soldiers are in Israel, Muslim ministers are on the radio telling the Israelis that you are killing innocent civilians in Gaza and that you are attacking innocent civilians and that you are damaging innocent civilians. There is no regard for life. They are killing Israelis and no one (in the media) is protesting. They were not responding to the bombing. That is a hatred. It’s not a religion. It is just a terrorist hate. The terrorist hate is the cause. It is not religious. They are killing people. They are murderers.
2775	Being in the police academy is very intense and can even be quite stressful. Were you being supportive when he was there? I don't want to be disrespectful to you but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish. Were you being demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story. As for your final paragraph, I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your breakup, then yes, get back with him.
2776	Being in the police academy is very intensive and can even be quite stressful.  Were you being supportive when he was there? I don't want to be disrespectful to you, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish. Were you being super demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story.  You should be happy that he was bettering himself and furthering his career.  I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back with him.

2780	Depends on your state...here in Nebraska Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in most custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. Sounds to me like your daughter needs a swift kick in the pants! It is a very difficult thing to deal with...watching your daughter self-destruct but it sounds like you have no choice. IF she was still living with her father you should be giving him money towards her support, but if she is "on her own" in her own apartment, you have no obligation to pay an 18 year olds rent. I would tell her she is on her own...IF she wants to come home and finish High School she can, but if she wants to be a junkie...she is on her own. She can move into the dope mans house, get a job, or join the army. All you can do is keep a light on and pray...but you don't have to pay.

2784	According to the laws of my state Legal Majority age is 19. Most states it is 18, but there are special circumstances in custody agreements that support is necessary through high school. In my opinion, I don't think that this is very fair of your daughter to have moved out, should not be staying home for the past year, but if she wants to live with her father you should be giving him money towards her support, otherwise she can live in her father's house and she can get a job or join the army. I would tell her that she is on her own because if she wants to come home to her father and finish high school you can but if she wants to join the army, she should do that and just go through high school like everyone else should.
2785	US does not want to steal Iraq's oil. It needs to control the world trade in oil. By effectively making American paper money redeemable in oil. The compliant Arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States. If they're allowed to start selling oil in Euros they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously. That's why Bush went to war with all these countries. To maintain American control over the oil trade.
2786	US doesn't want to steal Iraq's oil because it needs to control world trade in oil, so it can bring its money into dollars, effectively making US paper money redeemable in oil. They agree with you that compliant regimes bring tens of billions of dollars into the US economy, but they're afraid that the Republican congress won't like to see more money in the US economy. That's why they went to war with all these countries, to maintain US control over the oil trade.
2787	US has decided to pull out and exert more control over oil trade.
2788	US doesn't want to steal Iraq's oil, it needs to control the world trade in oil. basically require all oil-producing countries to market their oil in dollars, effectively making American paper money redeemable in oil. compliant Arab regimes also re-invest hundreds of billions of dollars of oil profits in the United States, if they're allowed to start selling oil in Euros they will invest their profits somewhere else and the US economy will suffer tremendously that's why Bush went to war with all these countries. to maintain America's control over the oil trade.
2789	Except oil from Iraq because all US wants is to control the world trade in oil. Their only concern is keeping control over the oil production and not buying it. Bush went to war with these countries because he had some dream that they would invest their oil money in the US and it would help American economy, but they made different plans and this thing ended in tragedy for US people.
2790	My vote will be a Gov't choice on this due to the threat to my family breathing. However, I favor "non smoking." In my home, people "only" have cigarettes in the house but I prefer the nice clean air to be free from smoke. And for health reasons, I do not allow the smoke out. Instead, I have a make-shift smoke-free ceiling for the whole house. Also, I have kids and smoke the first in line.

2791	It depends on the place and the owners of the place.
2792	If this passes I won't have a choice if I smoke or not.
2793	If Prop 22 passes, non smokers will have to move to other states to avoid smoke. This is unfair, and we should not be able to discriminate against other people on the basis of smoking.
2794	Most of the time it doesn't bother me as much because most places are non-smoking. However, bars here in Ohio aren't most of the time. Also, since I don't smoke and see other people do, it seems to bother me. Maybe the next day after smelling my clothes and hair, but my breath probably stinks just as bad after a night of drinks. This is just a way for people to control and get money. One of the issues on the ballot if you read it closely says, "Money for Clean Air Fund." If they ban smoking, why would you need the Clean Air Fund? And what are you going to do with the money? I prefer my money to go to my child's college fund, but if this passes, I won't have a choice, will I?
2795	If you are with your children, supervising them, then you wouldn't need a registry to do it for you. It is your responsibility as a parent to supervise your children at all times. If you will look at the horrendous crimes against children, they are children that were not being supervised by a parent. Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent and the registries do nothing but provide a false sense of security.

Also, 90 to 95% of sex offenses occur by someone known to the child within the family or close friends. Stranger danger is not all that prevalent.

2800	In the state of Georgia, a 17 year old can not move out of their parents house without their permission. Unless another guardian is appointed or an amandment can be made. Contact your local juvenile legal office if in doubt. The only reason the police don't enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most cops are not up to date with juvenile law. In another few months it won't hurt if you truly love your ex-friend and you can finish college to make your future brighter. Then you can ask for a divorce from Mom and get custody of the baby. Good luck!!! When you get there, just say good bye. 
2801	As of 2006, a child of 17 years of age cannot move out of parents home without permission unless another guardian is appointed or he or she is emancipated.  Contact your local juvenile office if in doubt.  The only reason the law enforcement doesn't enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most police officers aren't up to date on juvenile laws. Another few months won't hurt if you truly in love and can finish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then maybe Mom will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!!!!  I've been there already
2802	In point of view, as of 2006, a child of 17 years of age can not move out of parents home without permission, unless another guardian is appointed or an amansia is appointed. Ask your local juvenile officer if in doubt. The only reason the law enforcement does not enforce this law is because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce and most police officers are not up to date with Juvenile Law. Another few months would not hurt if you truly in love and you can finish school to make a brighter future for the two of you. Then just maybe Mom will be more for the relationship. Good Luck!!!!!
2803	By the time you become 17, the law allows a child to move out of the home only if he or she has a permanent guardian. If this individual is not present, you need a legal guardian to move out of the home. Unfortunately, it is costly or unpopular policy and only implemented when the economy is booming.
2804	The law of Georgia states that a child of 17 years of age cannot move out of his/her parents home without the parents' permission, unless the parents appoint a guardian. Contact your local juvinile office if you have questions about this law. The law enforcement does not enforce this law because it would cost millions of dollars to enforce. It wouldn't hurt to work on your dream school and still get in touch with your parents later in life. Good Luck!
2805	The first answerer is right. I don't know Louisiana law, but I've never heard of a state putting something like that into law. Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating. If you want a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.
2806	Truly, the employer cannot terminate you on the first day without notice, but many employers do tell an employee that they will be retrenching and if they don't want to be retrenched, they are to give the manager a two-week notice.
2807	The first answerer is correct.  I don't know Louisiana law, but I've never heard of a state putting something like that into law.  Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating.  If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.

2810	There is nothing wrong with being black or green, but if you're not able to pay for your service, they have the right to stop them. Sounds like they gave you at least a couple of breaks, and you chose not to do what is right. You have the right to say that because I'm Native American and I'm damn proud of being Native American, and I don't feel discriminated because I pay my bills on time if not early.
2811	While you seem to be looking for something that is to be discriminated against. So they have the right to stop your service if you miss your payments whether white, black, purple or green, they should not be. Now there should be no argument here..if you are a Criminal, you have a right to be stupid, and dumber about your money. I don't want money for nothing.... it's that simple... I just had my prescription filled yesterday...don't mind the fact that I'm speaking when I say I, I mean the bad guy above who has no manners and has no sense of tact or civility.....  I gave him a break... I still owe... and I did... and I expect my stuff... including this Cell.... my 2 Tons of Books I paid for before I left Afghanistan..... NO CC No Pay Monthly.... JUST COME BACK IN NINE MONTHS.... if not.....Ill even give him the returns key and leave!!   NO!!. NO!!. NO!! 
2812	You seem to be looking for something to be discriminated against. If you miss your payments whether you are white, black, purple, or green, they have the right to discontinue their services to you. Sounds as though they gave you at least a couple of breaks and YOU chose to not do what is right. And I have the right to say this as I am Native American and I am damn proud of it and I do not feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time if not early!!
2813	Native Americans do not have to pay rent or any bills on time if they are smart enough to know that it is illegal to get away with it. So, if you feel discriminated against please be smart enough to know you can take the law into your own hands. The law states that they have the right to discontinue their services to you if you don't pay your bills on time. So, just know that if they discontinue their services to you, it is not your fault that the law says so and that you have no right to demand they continue their services. Do not try to look for excuses, if you don't pay your rent or bill on time the owner of the service has the right to discontinue your services and their obligation is not to continue service to you even if the law says so.
2814	I'm sorry. There has to be a reason why you cannot pay them on time and the reason is because they need the money more than you.  The reason they provide you with so little service in the beginning is because they gave you at least a few breaks and you chose to not do what is right and that is pay your bills on time.  And yes, I have the right to say this as I am Native American and damn proud of it and I do not feel discriminated against because I pay my bills on time if not early!
2815	There is nothing special about sheriffs department, they are just one more collection agency that is really actively pursuing debtors and they have this illusion that all sheriffs are collection agnostic. They are bluffing you to the point that they can behave aggressively, but in reality, they are enforcing laws in their respective areas. There are two issues here: if it's collection agnostic how can a sheriff be doing any collection? and how can a sheriff be making a sale? I assume that they are not claiming that they actually make a sale from their mouth, but what they are saying is that the sheriffs are on a handshake that it is common sense and understandable ( as long as an enforcement path is open). That is really quite trite but the rule of thumb is you can sell to a sheriff ( legally ), but you can not force them to sell the item ( barring that you have evicted ).
2816	The Sheriff's Department are not creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman and the laws are very clear as to this. There is no harrassment because the Sheriff's Department only wish to let the responsible party to an asset can collect and not allow an unscrupulous person gain one for himself. The job of the Sheriff's Department is to ensure that an owner of an asset is responsible and has properly serviced the property.
2817	There is a moral thing to be said for the sheriffs department to not make sales as this keeps the city of san diego short from getting a deby to collect his/her dues. As a side note the sheriff has to help anyone that can afford to help and to allow his/her community to function well.
2818	the sheriffs department do not have sales. They are not in the business of being creditors/liquidators/repossesors, salesmen. They are bluffing you (harassment), they are laws on this. When a debt gets due collectors are aggressive on collection. The only thing a sheriffs department can do is allow a party to collect cars... ect.(not sure about furniture), or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
2819	deby harassment at the sheriffs can only be done at the courts only. ( not sure about furniture), but the sheriff can ensure a safe and legal eviction at your own home.
2820	No one objects when people commit crimes, and a lot of innocent people are accused and executed (just as many criminals are not executed as cases are brought to trial). However, we all know that some legal systems are not fair because they allow accusations against innocent people to go forward. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
2821	There has to be a fair trial in each legal system and courts that have the accused before them who are facing trial elsewhere should have the accused before them be well-evident and they should be convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they extradite people abroad.
2822	Neither should any of us understand the legal system because we know that accusations are made against innocent people and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness.
2823	There shouldn't be any objection to sending away the accused who commit crimes, because justice should be served even if the criminals go abroad. However, we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere want to be very well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
2824	When charges are raised against innocent people, and legal systems are different from one country to the next, it is only natural that courts that have accused before them face trial elsewhere would want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case against them.
2825	On what basis is it reasonable to have a law against someone singing in the bath? Suppose you already know that the person has been given some form of education. He could well be some kind of lonely or depressed person. Suppose he likes to sing. Maybe his condition was caused by a personal tragedy. Perhaps he's never had any other friends. Whatever the case, it's his right to live his life as he sees fit. Why should his freedom of expression be restricted?
2826	Many things you say are stupid but that one about singing in the bath seems to have a moral background. It seems stupid to us now and it probably was stupid by the time it was passed, too. But it responded to the moral standards of that time.
2827	Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless at the time. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed (for example a law forbidding to have meat, during periods when cows were seriously ill, and there was no other means to warn the people about the dangers of eating that meat). What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful.
2828	Because someone didn't think they were stupid or senseless. And some of the laws we have now actually may not have been stupid when they were passed. What is stupid is to forget to remove them when they are no longer useful. For example, the law prohibiting meat for those who had contractually agreed to pay only salaries in kind. Or laws limiting the size of boats on the ocean or airplane cabin size. Or the salt content of bread. Laws like that existed, and they were stupid. But it responded to the moral standards of that time.
2829	On the other hand, by forbidding bath singing in that time you show that you are no longer concerned with your moral standards.
2830	Stalin's goal was communism and he treated all groups poorly, which included the Jews. Sorry to say we treat people badly, especially those groups that we see as inferior, we are not necessarily being cruel, or pursuing the goal to see no one alive.  However, the people are still worthy of life, but don't show interest in our experience's or have a say.  That is unfortunately, what happened to the "Jewish Question".
2831	Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly. Unfortunately, the documentaries on him are anti-comunist, and rather biased
2832	It wasn't just the jews, ho!  The nazi's weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others didn't fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily. That's what the nazis did to various people groups. Stalin just treated everyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a "Harvest of Despair". You should watch the documentary below:
2833	Not only did the nazis not act out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. The path to hell is paved with good intentions, so their actions were not viewed as hateful by others. They wanted a master race, and what they are doing is exactly what we do to other species.  We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings and no rights to live happily.  That is exactly what Stalin did to many people groups. Stalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and it is sad to say it is essentially the same thing that the nazis were doing with their atrocities against different people groups.
2834	It wasn't just the Jews that the Nazis were doing what they thought was right. The Nazis were just like Stalin, if not more so.  The Nazis didn't hate them any more than they hated Catholics, Jews, Allied troops, gays and indeed everyone.  And even worse than those other things the Nazis used them as experiments on animals, and tortured them to be at the very end of things.  In some cases, they raped their sisters and threw their father in a ditch with a rope around his neck. Sorry for all the bad things they did, but hey, no matter how evil their intentions are...we shouldn't get excited over evil. Check out the documentary below.
2835	In my opinion, I think it is not acceptable to have a black mother and a white father. I am certain a child would be confused if there were two black mothers/parents. It would be better if we had a bit different parent.
2836	More than one woman or more than one man is not a good idea for a child. This will confuse the child. The child needs both a mother and father, and not two women or two men.
2837	In my opinion, yes. How would that affect the child is the first concern. When the child is small, it would most definitely not affect the child. But as he/she entered the school, it would most definitely get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/ problems from this. This would really confuse the child! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
2838	In my opinion, yes it does. How would that effect the child is the first concern. When the child is small wouldn't be the issue, but as he/she entered school it would most defiantly get ridiculed by the other kids and have emotional stress/problems from this. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women, and not two men.
2839	In my opinion no it would not affect the child in any way when it is young it wouldn't affect their life. Yet as it gets older the child would most defiantly have emotional stress/trouble and confusion from that. This would really confuse the kid! I don't care what anyone says, a child needs a MOTHER and a FATHER. Not two women and not two men.
2840	So where exactly is the "freedom of religion" in the law? Well, nowhere because that is a constitutional right that was added not to restrict religion, but to protect people who don't share that religion. So any religious law that aims to discriminate against people who don't belong to that religious organization is unconstitutional. If someone thinks that that religious law violates the free exercise clause, I don't know why you should let it pass, because the free exercise clause was written to protect religious discrimination, not religious toleration.
2841	It is the free exercise of the religion clause, not the Establishment Clause, that addresses the question of discrimination against homosexuals. So the freedom of religion right is not the issue. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws.  Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against homosexuals seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion.  It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
2842	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies. The “freedom of religion” right is not the issue. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible to discriminate against gays seem to think they can use their religion to make laws, because they are the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to do so on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.
2843	Some people think that they can use religious rights to make it legal for discrimination against gays. Unfortunately, they're mistaken. The "freedom of religion" right is not the issue. It's the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws. The vast majority of the answers given here make this same mistake. It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the "freedom of religion" right is not the issue. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion. It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.

2845	I think this policy is a good idea. That way, everyone at the school is on the same playing field. However, some students who are less fortunate have to worry about what their going to wear to school because they don't have enough money to buy clothes or they have too many clothes. I think this helps self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on schoolwork.
2846	I think it a good idea to provide T-shirt for every student. It helps them have a better sense of identity at school and allows them to concentrate more on their schoolwork.
2847	Students at school should all have the same basic needs. Clothes should be provided by the school. Students who have less money to buy clothes or many clothes don't have to worry about what they are going to wear. It helps their self-esteem and allows them to concentrate more on school work.
2848	If we all felt the same, there would not be a problem. I mean, if everyone felt they were underpaid, there would still be a problem.
2849	Feels like you're making fun of people's feelings
2850	No.  Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be executed.  Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.

2852	Capital punishment is a hypocritical policy because any society that values human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be unreasonable to include it in their justice system. Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
2853	No. There is always a risk that innocent people will be executed if the punishment system is not fair. Moreover, punishing children is wrong. Children are innocent, immature, and their crime is not one to be punished. If you have decided on capital punishment, make sure to only give it to adults who actually deserve it. This also makes sure that it isn't restricted to those with the greatest economic means.
2854	Certain parties in a society that value the value of a human life and promote non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.

2855	If you are speaking of having the government interfere with what we as parents and responsible adults do to teach our children, then no. With regards to the FCC, and what is transmitted over the airwaves and is available for public display, yes. However, the government should also set absolute specifics for such media outlets.
2856	When it comes to moral standards, parents, should simply get off their lazy asses, and teach their children right from wrong, talk with them and keep an open line of communication.

2860	Irish don't go around saying their heritage is being mocked. It is ridiculous. If any Native Americans are really concerned about this issue, why not look at poverty on the reservations, poor schooling, etc.  There's so much more to worry about than school mascot names.
2861	Here's always been my thought: I'm Irish and don't complain that Notre Dame's nickname is the Fighting Irish. I don't go around saying my heritage is being mocked or that I'm offended because "people think I like fighting." It's ridiculous.

2865	Answer is YES. However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
2866	Answer is no but I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs.

It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
2867	Actually, we can't answer that in a final and conclusive manner. However, I think the bigger problem is who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
2868	Answer is NO. However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Bush era employees. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.

2870	It doesn't need to be legal. Just say you love each other and are together.
2871	You don't need to get married to get a lifetime commitment from the person you love the most. Just tell her, she's your wife and hold a wedding ceremony somewhere the both of you find attractive and share your thoughts on the future and express your love for one another. Also, don't forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life. Because that's what marriage is all about.
2872	You don't need a piece of paper from anyone to prove that you are married and want a lifetime commitment from the person you love the most, just tell her she's your wife and hold a ceremony somewhere the both of you find attractive and express your love for one another. And don't forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life.
2873	You don't need a piece of paper from anyone to prove to you that you are married and want a lifetime commitment to your wife and don't forget to continue this thinking in every day for the rest of your life. That's what it's all about.
2874	Do you honestly think your all important? Use your mind and ask if you can prove it.  If the woman is wearing the wedding ring the wedding ceremony is complete no papers needed.  A good lifetime commitment has nothing to do with papers and it does with the two people.  The two people should at least show their understanding of how to live each others lives and share, not even in day to day life.  In most countries many people just live a life and no papers are checked.  Live and let live! Your important not if you can or can not have papers.

2880	If the male were to sue the female for damages, that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity would be used in criminal proceedings. However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare. Some states do not allow it at all.  Others, like the "permanent" insanity defense, restrict it considerably.
2881	If the male were to sue the female for damages that is a civil action.  The defense of temporary insanity is used in criminal proceedings.  It generally would not apply to a civil proceeding.  However, the defense of temporary insanity is (contrary to what you see on television and the movies) extremely rare.  Some states do not allow it at all.  Others, just like the permanent insanity defense, restrict it considerably. Mental anguish is a tort.  I think it unlikely under the circumstances that a jury would give her much for a mental anguish claim.  The fact that its a marriage that is obviously in trouble, and he would be able to produce his own evidence, would problably not make the case a viable case, IMHO. The laws governing the above vary greatly from state to state.  For the most accurate information, you should consult an attorney who is licensed in your state.  If you need a referral, contact your local or state bar association.
2882	Aggravated assault is a form of assault.  First degree assault and battery are similarly severe crimes, but attempt is a misdemeanor for aggravated assault.

2885	It's boring and scary.  I would not complain about the regular sex.  Shower time can get right out of hand.  Seriously, it is a drag.  Psychiatric wards are more scary, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke.  Many good looking loonies in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it.  So each has it's pros and con's but I would have to recommend psychiatric ward over jail.  I do not endorse jail, but if I were broke and had to smoke, I would rather get stuff than go to jail.   psych ward maybe is not so bad after all. psych ward maybe is not so bad after all.
2886	Being boring doesn't necessarily mean losing your self respect. It means they don't wanna hear what's on your mind and you can break out any old damn time.
2887	To lose your self respect is nothing to be upset about. It is just your sense of self. I am just dandy.

2890	There are literally thousands of water companies in the US.  They are generally regulated by various federal and state agencies. If they comply with those regulations, there is no basis for a suit, class action or otherwise.  In order to prevail, you would have to prove negligence.   If you don't like tap water, drill your own well, install your own filtration system or buy bottled water. But, you will not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove they are negligent.

2893	In point of view, what I would suggest is that not everyone drinks tap water, so you shouldn't be imposing your own set of norms and regulations on tap water. Also, the same goes for the petroleum industry. Why should they keep destroying the environment and polluting its water if we don't like it? If you don't think that tap water is safe, why don't you also join efforts and buy bottled water instead? You would not prevail if you attempt to sue a water company unless you prove that they were negligent. So please understand that you should not discuss the policy of buying bottled water as a remedy for the low quality of tap water.

2895	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but the same tactic has been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
2896	Yes it does cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but no, it will not cause it to think twice about selling it.  The same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
2897	Yes and no; over the short term it would cause the retailer to order more furs, but long term if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling fur, which is not good business practice. The same tactic has also been used against private citizens where activists would wait near big public events where wealthy folks know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
2898	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it--buying merchandise that you can't sell is not good business practice.

2900	The adverserial legal system is governed by rules of conduct and engagement imposed on both parties. In that sense it is ethical as it provides a structure for "fair play". However, a lawyer's job is to win a case for his/her client. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the otherside. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process that we have provides the best way to redress a wrong since a party that feels its claim was not handled well/fairly within the scope of the law, can in some cases seek further action through the appelate courts. This is as good as it gets folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Sheria/Law, where justice is meted out in the form of chopping off body parts.

2903	Lawyers have very strict ethics that may not reflect the system's benchmarks on any cases. However, lawyers put in time and money (and points) to ensure that their clients are getting a fair shake. Taking advantage of loopholes in the law is one way to beat the opposition and otherside is very counter to what lawyers do - in fact, it's what they are hired for! LOVE 'EM!
2904	Our legal system provides an ethical structure and the opportunity to fair play. However, a lawyer's job is to win cases for his client. Taking advantage of legal loopholes is one way to beat the other side. In some cases, this may not be ethical. Nevertheless, the legal process provides the best way to redress a wrong as a party that feels its claim has not been handled well/fairly can seek further action through appeal courts. This is as good as it gets folks! The alternative would be Hamurarbbi's Fen-S राय which refers to the law that is used in the Rasa vacuum state. In that case, justice would be meted out as a supernatural supernatural force is controlling everything. In an extremely twisted sort of way, where a victim's soul is separated from it's body. This is of course to be considered very horrifying in hindsight. Nevertheless, it might still provide an extremely viable option for some desperate survivors.
2905	Firstly does your bf own the company or is he a worker? Each union has a legal capacity and has a legalised right to join. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your bf has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man is he really an illegal allien? INS could come in and send him back. You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respect the work they do. When people don't feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group. Unions are not all demons nor is management always the enemy however if that's how management and union posture themselves then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
2906	Firstly does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Second of all unions are legal and are allowed to sign up members. However this sounds like it goes a little far. Unless your boyfriend has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man, is he really an illegal alien? Then INS could come in and send him back. You know unionism only grows when the employees feel that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do. When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group. Unionism is not all demons nor is management always the enemy, however if that's how management and union posture themselves, then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
2907	Firstly does your BF own the company or is he a worker? If your BF is a worker then he doesn't own the company and isn't entitled to union protections, because he is employed by it. Thus there are quite a few issues between him and the union he's a part of. Unions are legally allowed to join members but not to dismiss them once they've joined. However this sounds like it goes a little far, unless your BF has done something like cross a picket line, then he better know he's not going to be liked or respected and that's why he's being called a rat and a scab. As for the other man is he really an illegal alien? If this answer is yes then I would start with deportation procedures. If he is not deported from the country then he should be punished for refusing to do his assigned work.
2908	First of all does your boyfriend own the company or is he a worker? Unionism only grows when employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecting the work they do. If management and unions are directing a voice of dissent then it goes a little far. Managers should not walk over their workers in a workplace and call them scabs, roaches or rats. If there is a genuine disagreement between management and employees then the government shouldn't interfere. Should union members be sent to foreign countries? If the government adopts a negative attitude then all it does is create bad jobs and discourage people from having a job. If the government were to offer jobs and other benefits to immigration then that would only benefit the illegals more as would adding an extra layer of bureaucracy in every area. Unions should only offer union members the services they already have and deny non-union members those services. The government should not interfere in labour relations and make the working world even more nasty and divisive.
2909	First of all, if your bf's father is not the owner of the company, it sounds like something could go wrong there because of how the system works. Also, unions are illegal in most of the world, so if he's ever been on a picket line or if he's ever been the leader of a union he better know what he's doing, because when he's being called a rat and a scab there's going to be a problem.   Here's another question about foreign people: His brother could be an illegal alien and so the INS could come and send him back and he's going to have a lot of trouble with the authorities and the courts, so he's not going to like it.   There will be rift in the family if things go bad like they did with all our other family members and it's very bad for a family where the family have a hierarchy where people are expected to tell their friends and family what is going on. If it goes bad and you know that he has problem with alcohol or whatever you could not support him. It could go bad for the whole family.  I'm not saying you're doomed to have a family that doesn't come together, but if that's how the family wants to manage it then there won't be any kind of labour peace.
2910	It is not smart to do poorly in school, which will limit your opportunities. In most cases, laziness is to blame. I almost get angry when I hear someone say this. Granted this is a blanket statement, and doesn't include outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or a disease. But most of the time, laziness is to blame. I heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge. Please change my view!
2911	You can be very clever and have terrible grades, but even you being very clever doesn't justify a poor school grade. Also, it is not smart to do poorly in school, thus limiting your opportunity. I really get angry when I hear someone say this. I do not understand why people say that people with poor grades are smart, and lazy people are stupid. In addition, this argument is a blanket statement, and it does not take into account the outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or disease.   I have heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument. This argument holds that people with poor grades are more clever then people with good grades. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge. Such a statement makes no sense to me. I know stupid people with good grades, which simply means they did their homework thoroughly, and were very diligent. If I were this stupid, I would not be able to pass my classes. A person who cannot even pass certain courses may be a bit harder to teach than people who do learn how to do this stuff but focus more on their studies. And of course there are geniuses who are
2912	Certainly, you can be very clever and have terrible grades, but at the same time it is not smart to do poorly in school, thus limiting your opportunity. I've heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge.  I almost get angry when I hear someone say this. Granted this is a blanket statement, and doesn't include outside circumstance such as extreme poverty or a disease, but I feel that 90% of the time laziness is to blame. I've heard the "I know stupid people with good grades" argument and I don't understand that. Even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge.  Please change my view!
2913	As I think, if you follow the policy, you can earn a very bad grade. However, don't let this circumstance ruin your life opportunity. That is why having great grades is smart.
2914	This statement is a bit silly, only playing into stereotypes of the ignorant. Outside circumstances (poverty, disease, etc.) do certainly contribute to poor performance in school, but I wouldn't say that laziness is the sole cause in any extreme cases. The society in which you grow up, your upbringing and your social surroundings all have an impact.
2915	I've been slowly losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd.   There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material?   All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. *Why* should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage.  CMV please.

2919	I've slowly lost belief in morality.   Some people think that there are moral rules that have some important importance. But I don't think that there are some powerful laws that control life. I don't think that morality comes from religion or natural law. I don't think that we are born with some morals. Nor do I think that other people are born with morality. I think that we set the morality into our own life in very subtle ways.   It should be noted that not every action or attitude is morally right.   It's our choice to say what moral actions are good and which one are bad. However, I'm pretty sure that I can't say with undivided certainty that I should do something and what my beliefs are. When I do something I don't feel that I am following morality and I am feeling that I am performing something just for the sake of goodness. Hence, morality has become something which don't interest me very much.
2920	taking care of ourselves, and others in our community is important. We shouldn't be without food, healthcare and we should be able to teach ourselves if we want to, and have a basic basic education.
2921	Everyone deserves a home and a good education and healthcare. No one should be poor.
2922	Everyone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. Im not saying put everyone into college, im just saying that if someone wants to better themselves with education, be it getting a basic high school education, a college degree, or some sort of trade, it should be available. This is where it gets unpopular. The government should pay for it. If we had a tax system that taxed the rich more and the poor less there would be money for programs that, feed, house, educate, and care for every single person.
2923	In point of view, no one should be homeless. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home. It is a human right that should be taken seriously by the government. No one should be living on the street. In the fact, they cannot be and that is extremely tragic, but it is their right to call home, be it in an apartment, in a shack, or a tent. Everyone needs food to be able to live, no one should be starving. The same thing goes for healthcare. Everyone should be given equal healthcare without discrimination. This is where it gets unpopular. The government should pay for it. If we had a tax system that taxed the rich more and the poor less, there would be more money for programs that feed, house, educate, and care for everyone. This way we would not be have so many people living on the streets and so many people in poverty. Every one should be entitled to some sort of education. Im not saying put everyone into college, i just saying that if someone wants to better themselves with education, be it getting a basic high school education, a college degree, or some sort of trade, it should be available. This is where it gets unpopular. The government should pay for it.  {This all depends on our worldview and what we think about a government being a bad idea. I believe that everyone should be getting something in their way of life that basic human needs are met, but with that, i don,t believe that anyone should be taxed by the government because the government has access to the wealth of the country, the people. For me the government should only provide shelter, food, and healthcare. Of course, the private sector should also provide those things but they are not always easy to get. If we had a tax system that taxed the rich more and the poor less there would be more money for programs that feed, house, educate, and care for everyone. This way we would not be have so many

I've noticed he has been getting lot of love on Reddit lately and I am surprised by this.   Steve Harvey has taken the family out of the show that had nothing to do with his family.

2929	On the show with family feud, I used to be able to watch it with my family, but it has become nothing but cheap sex jokes. And I'm embarrassed to watch it with them anymore.  The questions are posed in such a way to elicit a dirty response from the contestants.  And when they do answer accordingly, Steve makes a shocked face to the camera as if that reply was so unbelievable. Every. Fucking. Time.

2930	Men and women make up the majority of the American population and often share the same characteristics when it comes to car insurance. This, I think, shows the same should be true when it comes to health insurance, and financial services, and all other insurance.
2931	Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 38 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 12 percent of the state prison population.
2932	I'm not a'masculinist', but it just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :
2933	Yes, I understand the facts that there are studies showing how young men can be more reckless than women, but that shouldn't be a good enough reason to treat men any differently than women. For example, "WHITES, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. WHITES, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population." Does this mean WHITES or WHITES should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No, this, I feel, is a good example of why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women. I’m not a ‘masculinist’, but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :) 
2934	I'd prefer to hear some other opinions about this, however, because I'm not a'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]  A:  All copy editors would probably throw up their hands in dismay if the first two paragraph was still "read" by its original content.    A:  I'll expand on Warne's answer for this reason: This is an unusual case. The original is devoted to a hypothetical conflict between two parties; you are tasked to find the logical flaw in it, and thereby persuade me that you are right and war is wrong. The original is about a hypothetical party that thinks up an unreal conflict and wins a war. Now your job is to take this party, choose two opposing sides to be involved in the hypothetical conflict, and do nothing but click away. That's a very, very bad job for a student: not just because your resume will probably be no more impressive, but because you will not know for sure if there is actually a conflict at stake, and if so, how the conflict would manifest if you did nothing. You should instead do something like this:  The people want to "forge a better future". The people want to "strengthen the United Nations". "The people" want the "creation of international war crimes courts". There is no one opposition to such courts, as any court would, as the entire idea is unworkable.  This is much clearer, but, I think, too simplified. What you really need to do is compare the original version with the war education version:  "It may create less damage to innocent civilians or third parties."  Comparing it with something that clearly says that wars on "human rights" have created many casualties both here on Earth and in space:  "In addition, lawsuits in distant parts of the solar system, across vast interstellar spaces and universes, led to billions of settlements, and the court decision of war crimes on other planets caused them to resort to counterattacking with near
2935	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I agreed with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten in a matter of months. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines?
2936	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs.

2940	After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed that this is a bullshit move. I have heard the usual reasoning that shows none of it. They work hard and usually only get paid enough that it pays for the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. To not tip our servers is a like a slap in the face to them. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal or kind, or what you want. Just be logical

2945	Unless the government wants to pay for the useless benefits of marriage such as social security and childcare, I can see no reason for government recognition. The benefits of marriage are inherently private so government has no right to force any of its citizens to get married. The government doesn't need to prove that marriage has benefits over single-parent living or bigamy, it already proves that by making it illegal. The government only needs to show it has made no effort in the last 25 years to prosecute bigamists and child abusers.
2946	It's easier to handle by contracts. If you want to get married, you still can, and you can do it in your own way, even your same-sex partner can! And if you signed up for the marriage license, you can just as easily sign up for some contracts. The government doesn't care for the marriage. Instant equality. Secondly, the additional bureaucracy can be addressed directly with contract papers. Now, to some anticipated counter points: The inheritance and hospital visitation issues can be addressed directly by contracts. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing, we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage. CMV.
2947	No benefits for married persons. First the benefits:  there will be no more fights over what marriage is.  If you want to get married in your church, you still can.  If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony, you can.  Government will not care.  Instant equality.   Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy.  No marriage - no messy divorces.  Instant efficiency.
2948	We can deal with the issue of the benefits of marriage through the contracts, money, inheritance, and child taxing. We can also ease the bureaucracy of getting your marriage registered. As for taxes, it's not fair that they would give tax breaks to people who have and have rare kids, and yet would refuse them to married people. If we as a society want to encourage child rearing, we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and have rare kids, not indirectly through marriage.
2949	First, I don't see any benefits of recognition of marriage. First, marriages now exist between people from different religion and people living in the same religion can be married in civil ceremonies. If people want to get married, they do it privately with the help of their priest or rabbi. Government doesn't really care whether you get married or not. Second, bureaucracy is cut in half if you don't get married (one less form to fill out, one less bureaucrat to see). Instant efficiency. In point of fact - it will make divorces much more difficult if people don't get married or if they get divorced. But it seems more difficult and more expensive to get divorced than before. Certainly it helps me in getting married. I already need two forms to have sex (not necessarily in my country).  How would you measure the benefit of additional forms of the marriage license? Secondly, inheritance and hospital visitation can be handled by contract. If people get married - they sign a contract acknowledging the marriage. This agreement can take place in a court. If you don't, or you decide to separate, you can move quickly through the form with the help of a lawyer. IMO, being married is not a necessity. As for having a baby - it will be easier to start a family if you don't get married. There is also a concern over having too many children, but it's probably always better to have only children than to have no children at all. Thirdly, I don't see how Banned water bottles can solve any environmental problems or can reduce the huge and harmful use of plastic water bottles. But it can be combined with other policies that do. Fourthly, natural schools have much more benefits than government schools. Newbie teachers do not have to take the same courses as experienced teachers. Since the graduates in natural schools do not require to pass a CPE exam, the system will be less conservative.   On the other hand, educated teachers can spend more time in their class and can give more knowledge to their students.   CMV.
2950	There should be no argument in this really, whatever way you see a fetus, its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you. And if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place, don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption in such cases. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life?
2951	The idea that discrimination against the rich is equal to all other forms of discrimination is not true.  There is absolutely no equal ethic for discrimination against two groups who achieve very different results. Discrimination is ethically wrong and our society should not subsidize the reproduction of those who are productive but not the reproduction of those who are not.
2952	People always talk about how unfair it is to discriminate against people, but I see tons of discrimination and hatred against the rich. I think this discrimination is just as morally wrong as all other forms of discrimination. America is always talked about as a free society and a land of equality, but how free and equal can it be if it charges certain people more for being more productive?!?! Additional taxes on the productive also serve the effect of discouraging this behavior, and our subsidy system for poor people (especially regarding reproduction) has grown the ranks of the poor by millions.

2955	There has been tension between Israel and Palestine for years. The populations of each side are different so there is a lot of miscommunication between these two nations. Also, the Israelis seem to ignore the fact that people have a choice when it comes to their settlements and civilian casualties. There seems to be a lot of prisoners on the Gaza side that are tortured. I think it is possible that these countries are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals, taking hostages (which could help account for the number of civilian casualties), and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians, resulting in genocide. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is "mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller, helpless nation" despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this.
2956	Every time I see the news, whether it be CNN, Fox, or BBC, I see in the headlines "ISRAEL BOMBS GAZA; WILL NOT STOP DESPITE KILLING CIVILIANS."

2960	If larger groups are harder to govern, we should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Georgia, Arizona, the Northwestern States, and the South. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is.
2961	The reason why larger countries are harder to govern well is that they have more people than smaller countries do.

2962	The smaller the body politic the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I say the reason is that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the United States into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy.

2965	Of course men have worn moustaches for thousands of years, the only unusual thing about men with moustaches is that not everyone with moustaches is a man. When the fingerstache meme first became popular, I was mortified because the moustache has now become a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards men. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse even is the fact that America has rampant consumerism that has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Each moustache that grows from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, a black, hairy, evil flag.
2966	Bill Clinton's moustache was his hipster flag as far as I see it, and it showed the light-skinned liberal hipster that, despite his anti-war stance and his love for non-white prostitutes, he still fought on the side of white supremacy. I hope that the Americans who think that mugging their billionaire mates for a selfie with a fedora on is a sign that they are Obama's dream world will be humbled by the fact that that is the most infantile and ugly thing they have ever seen. It is as though they are praying for a staph infection when all they can muster are sarcasm and rage.
2967	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913. Since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more. When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man.

Each moustache that sprouts from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, a black, hairy, evil flag.

To me, a person who throws up a fingerstache is probably gonna project his hipster tastes and preferences onto the populous by force. Worse still is the fact that Americas consumptive hipsterism has created a voicelessness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with a fingerstache pillow, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Each moustache sprouted from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, an evil black flag.
2969	Regarding the embarrassing trends towards hand tattoos and fingerstaches we have come to the same conclusion regarding these two horror trends that have scarred the aesthetics of our beautiful American flag: Hand tattoos, except for the very rare case of a hand tattoo that signifies authority, should be illegal under all circumstances due to the fact that tattoos are an unintended departure from the American ideal of kindness and the beauty that goes with it and also contribute to festering of racism (similar to the Nazis gloves). When someone takes the time to decorate their body with some truly horrific blood orange eyebrows, hand tattoos and fingerstaches, we should only think of them as an unwitting ally of the despicable system of Black Lives Matter and I would encourage them to remove all three from their beautiful faces.
2970	If a victoy of an underage person had to be punished, I think that all sexual predators should be castrated rather than leaving them free to rape someone again and again.
2971	I know this is a touchy subject, and most people will go with the capital punishment law, however I currently believe that we let these guys off too easy and they will think it's okay to do again and again Honesty if someone did this to your child, and they caught them what would you do? I'm only 23 and this subject angers me greatly I chose the age of 30 because I believe the age gap between 30 and 17 (or younger) is too big I feel like this should be done for sexual crimes because I don't think anybody could possibly get turned on by murder I could be wrong though I belive castration would be a suitable punnishment because you wouldn't really be able to rape a minor without a penis.

2974	If some sicko does this to your child, and caught them, what would you do? I'm only 23, and this issue angers me greatly. I'd let them go so long as they confessed. I believe castration would be the best punishment for rape because no one could ever get turned on by murder.
2975	Being horny is a sin.
2976	Being horny is sinful. Wanking is sinful, having sex with your girlfriend is sinful, raping is sinful. If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an idea of what's wrong and what's right. We should teach morals and not religion. Religion teaches that natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on horny feeling is wrong? I'm not saying rape is right but saying consential sex with your girlfriend is not sinful and putting them in the same context of'sin' is causing rape.
2977	Being horny is a sin. Wanking is a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is a sin. Raping is a sin. If this is what young men are taught, how can they have an concept of what right and wrong actually are. We should teach morals not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornyness is wrong. I'm not say rape is right, just that consensual sex with a girlfirend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a'sin' is causing rape.
2978	Being horny is not a sin. Wanking is not a sin. Having sex with your girlfriend is not a sin. Raping is not a sin. I am not saying that young men are taught wrong and right, I'm saying that a morongen teachings bring up wrong connotation. We should teach morals not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on hornynesis is wrong? I'm not say rape is right, but where is the common strong relationship of creating morongent.
2979	It's not a sin because all those sex acts are judged as sexual assault by the legal system. This is why we should teach morality and not religion. Religion teaches natural feelings are wrong. You don't tell a woman feeling cold is wrong so why tell a man acting on horniness is wrong? I'm not saying rape is right just that consial sex with a girlfiend is not wrong and putting the two in the same context of a'sin' is causing rape.
2980	I've been looking into this economic doctrine for a while, and I just don't see how in 2014 you can still defend these principles as being either ethical or particularly effective. I understand that it was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s ended. However, I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, creates serious economic inequality, erodes social good, and continues to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I'm genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind policy? or does it simply concentrate wealth?
2981	NEoliberalism helps creating monopoly, developing wealth, and create a stable boom-bust cycle. As for the last statement, neoliberalism concentrates wealth only to a small group of people, but they have more power to control our lives.
2982	There is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, creates serious economic inequality, erodes social good, and continues to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence.

2983	It’s been awhile that I have been writing like here every two weeks, so hopefully it will work to help you. So today, I wanted to write about a term that is commonly used in this everyday life. According to the RAND Corporation, there are around 3.2 Billion people in the world. I feel that this is not enough to humanize the world. Because in every single person of us there is something else, that makes us look for the human beings. And I know that it is important to be human because it is the one thing that humans have in common. What humans have in common is that we are all human. There are no other species that have that kind of connection, so, let's search for human to human connection. We need to stay happy in this world and to become friend of other people. How can we do that? First, let's look in ourselves and try to be like you in that you can look for happiness. If we say that there are only human beings in this world, then we need to be like us. That is not human connection. So then what do we need to do? We need to help others. In this world there are many children that don't have schooling because they do not have money. We need to do our part to

2985	George W Bush has fallen in history. He was irresponsible, failed in many respects and put the country in a very bad place. Let’s review all of his failures:  1. He was asleep at the wheel/ignored all the warnings for 9/11  2. He completely fabricated the pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilized the region for decades.  3. He kept on starting two wars in the Middle East, engaged in doomed attempt to national building/bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies.  4. He was asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession in history.  5. He cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in massive spending cuts on social services during the great recession.  And probably many more I’m leaving out, but I think this is enough to get this conversation started.
2986	George Bush was not the worst president in history by far. Though he did do things like 9/11 and Iraqi War, I think he was still at least a "little" better president than either Bush 3 or Bush 41. Also there were lots of presidents before him who did similar stuff and yet they haven't been called in better presidents. Although I think George W Bush is starting to go down as the worst president in history after all of the failures he has gotten himself into.
2987	George W Bush, because only George W Bush can make the American economy a disaster. 
2988	George W. Bush was going to go down in history as one of the worst presidents in history, but in the past three years we are seeing Iraq unravel, we are seeing the region destabilized for decades. We are seeing the country being unnecessarily bombed, as we are seeing from the video that he has.      Let's review what he has done:  1. Asleep at the wheel, ignoring all the warnings for the September 11th attacks  2. Completely false pretext for war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region for decades. After starting two wars in the Middle East, engaged in the doomed attempt at nation building/ bringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies.  3. After startign the wars in the Middle East, presiding over the worst recession since the Great Depression. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services during the great recession.  4. Asleep at the wheel during the housing/finance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the great depression.  5. George W. Bush is the worst president in US history.
2989	It would not be reasonable to postpone the elections under these circumstances. It would also be reasonable to request the early start of polls. There is a significant higher chance that that would happen than that civil war breaks out. The risks don't seem overwhelming...but let's see...   1. Potential civil war or precipitous collapse of governments in Iraq and Afghanistan...this sounds like it may be happening already.   2. Badly managed crises like Katrina and Rita may still continue.   3. Miscelaneous breakdowns of Western democracies...almost every region of the world is in some kind of mess...that is going to need to be dealt with one way or the other.   4. It is possible that strong dictators would take over, bringing new and worse oppressions than they would bring when we have more power.   5. Support for dictators like Saddam Hussein may return...but we have to keep in mind the oppression that those regimes had brought to the Iraqi people...we cannot just have our backs turned to that.   6. More militarization of governments and refugees, and possibly more terrorism since there will be less support for democracy...   7. The Western democracies may collapse along with the European Union...we will be left with chaos, instability, with economic crisis.   8. Terrorist attacks will start to go up again...   9. Some of the resolutions of this crisis (like those on climate change) are not going to be implemented...   10. Short term we will be in much more warfare and brutal and repressive governments...but the real point of this is to change the way we think about how we govern ourselves and the world around us...  So my personal prediction right now is that the world may be getting less free and much more authoritarian, i.e. we have won war but lost the peace. I hope that is wrong, and that I am wrong...but at the moment, the world seems to be moving in that direction.  Also the increasing number of appeals against the war are worth mentioning...but we should recognize that this is not a temporary movement that will subside...we have to work toward political change.
2990	The schools are teaching kids the philosophy of learned helplessness. It only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration. The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings. When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That is what the school system and laws in place do. I also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who can't solve problems on their own.
2991	School system is promoting students to be individuals who cannot solve problems on their own.  It only causes the true victims to suffer at the hands of those who claim to be their "superiors."  The current Stop Bullying campaigns teach kids that bullying doesn't happen. It's not natural. This doesn't allow any of the "crazies" in the classroom to realize that it just is. If you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That's how bullying works. The laws in place teach students that bullying doesn't happen. It's not natural. This keeps any of the "crazies" in the classroom from realizing that it just is. If you haven't noticed, people in society today are reacting in an automatic mode. They all live and think as a single minded collective.  Let's look at this from the left.  All the bits in that key are absolutely disconnected.  It's not enough to look at or put on the colour key. You've got to try and put those colours in the respective key areas.  Then you can realise what things actually mean.
2992	The schools are teaching kids learned helplessness, and it only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration.

2993	Teaching the truth to kids that don't want to listen is the only way to stop bullies from getting away with their actions. To back an animal in a corner will likely strike with full force. That's what schools and laws are designed to do. They are causing kids to get into trouble because of false expectations in school and laws can only be designed to punish certain crimes not to correct what is wrong with the system. I believe laws and policies have turned kids into people who can't solve problems on their own because they are only thinking out of the box for those who want to put them in bad situations. When you put an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That's what schools and laws are designed to do. They are causing kids to get into trouble because they put a fence in front of them and cannot escape from it. They teach the power of the bell and make it so important when you can get into so much trouble trying to teach a kid to pass his tests or earn his diploma or whatever in a way that you would never put an animal in
2994	The schools are teaching kids to be passive.  It only causes the true victims of the school system to suffer at the hands of administration.

2995	Let's have games... soccer vs rugby or football [NFL] or what ever name it goes by that's important that the game be played with foot only & & every country have their sports to represent that country and the UK and Ireland should have soccer.
2996	In Ireland there is football, where you kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup. But there is also Gaelic football. In the United States there is soccer and football [NFL]. I believe football in America is called football despite being egg shaped is because it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport. Most of the times the NFL is not the actual game of the past, but a passion of the people who wish to be a part of the sports, which is commonly referred to as football, irrespective of the cup being competed for. Based on the above, in Ireland the NFL is Gaelic Football, which is played across the island. Soccer is the foreign sport, so why is it different? Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view
2997	In Ireland, football, or Gaelic Football, is played all over the country. Soccer, the foreign sport is played in America. I believe it's football because it is the national sport of that country, while soccer is the foreign sport. Why does it matter based on who you are or who you are speaking to? It shouldn't because that's not who the term is associated with in any of those countries.   Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national sport of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view of what football is
2998	In Ireland there is Gaelic Football.  In America there is Soccer and Football [NFL]. I believe football in America is called football despite being egg shaped because it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport.  Based of the above; in Ireland the NFL is Gaelic Football as it is played all across the island; Ireland and Northern Ireland [two separate counties]. Soccer is the foreign sport, so why is different? Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view

3000	I'm currently in a long-distance relationship in a corporation that won't allow me to move to where my significant other lives and works. I believe we are in inflexible corporate jobs that don't allow you to move even though you want to change jobs. There should be an equal place for women and men because I'm a woman and I believe women have to be respected as equals. I don't speak the language he speaks although I am learning it.  How do I move forward and what beliefs should I be focusing on for those who have had to make these same choices?
3001	Forget about moving to where your significant other is, or starting a long distance relationship. If you truly love him and are willing to sacrifice your career for him, your career can help you set up a better life for you and him in your new country.   Life in other countries is hard. Being married and starting your own family will be even harder if you have to find a job and stay there for long periods of time.   However, you can earn money, learn a second language, and build a better future as an independent person. If you must move to your significant other's country, be sure to plan for schooling your children there, in a language they understand. It might be a good idea to take him or her with you if you can afford it, because if you can't, they may try to learn it in school in another country and you will have to go with them.
3002	Although I am in my 30s, I believe it is impossible to sacrifice my career for a big move.   You have no idea what it is like to live in many cultures and to move to where my partner is.   CMV you should think about it. I am not ready for something like that. They are not easy choices.
3003	I finally got to mid career level management as a woman in my 30s. I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. We are both in inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am nearing the age of 30, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I do not speak the language he speaks, but I am learning it.
3004	This question in context is outdated. Please check this thread before posting as it might get you a better advice from the community.
3005	The iPhone's built-in PMA component should provide power for the smartphones, but Powermat can replace it as well. It’s better for them to use Powermat which can directly charge phones from your car.
3006	Powermat is being installed in 100,000 locations in the United States. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA chip it will be convenient for them to use. A lot of the CMV deployments will be the ones who own an iPhone. 
3007	Powermat is being installed in millions of locations around the U.S. If the next iPhone has a built in PMA component, then Qi will lose the war. Apple users are often Starbucks and Teavana regulars, so it will be convenient for them. Powermat will be installed everywhere for the 50% of smartphone users in the U.S. who own an iPhone and Qi will die. CMV    To be clear, I don't want this to happen. I support Qi and I don't like the data transmission (pushed ads) that PMA can do. So I want someone to give me hope for Qi. Please. Thank you.
3008	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
3009	Electronic devices such as the smartphone are becoming more and more complex. With the complex new features come a lot of potential data transmissions. In fact, some devices can transfer information to other devices that they are not designed to connect. Cell Phones and Smart Phones do not have the design for interference. As such, one cannot assume that every cell phone is receiving all other cell phones in transmission. Also, the counterfeiters will either replace the batteries or make them look the same, even if this causes connectivity issues.
3010	On the other hand, by doing away with offsides in soccer, the teams are forced to spread out more evenly across the entire field. This requires both teams to pass a lot and shoot at the other. This might result in a lot more scoring goals, which would make the game more exciting.
3011	By making offsides illegal, you'll probably have more shots in, and better shots when shots come in. Which can lead to more goals, thus more excitement. If you have fewer shots to try (and greater pressure), goalies have to be kept busy (otherwise, the whistle-blower wins and you have a turnover). So, teams should be pushed to take extra shots. But its difficult to do so in a truly scrappy game. All I can say is, watch great soccer and be amazed at its superiority to any other game, and try to understand why you are better entertained by it. Maybe something can be done to balance it a bit more. But since this is only a suggestion, I don't say take this as one.
3012	Do away with offsides in soccer would make the game much more exciting. If the teams were both forced to spread across the entire field, everyone has more space, which allows for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. I think this would allow for games to be much more higher scoring, therefore making it more exciting and more pleasing for the fans. Hardly any games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be ended, or at least greatly reduced.
3013	Regardless if the offsides rule is not used, soccer would be much more exciting. If the teams were allowed to spread out, everyone has more room to move around, which allows more exciting offensives. When a team cannot cover space, their defense becomes the core of their offense. I think the whole offsides rule seems unnecessary when it comes to soccer, considering almost every other sport currently doesn't use it. However, I think if the rule was dropped it would be an exciting game. Watching soccer between Brazil and Argentina the other day, we could see how essential the offsides rule is. The game got so crazy that even if the penalties had not been given, the game would still have ended in a tie. There are only a handful of sports where the offsides rule is utilized, soccer being one of them. The sport remains to have the offsides rule because it is considered to be the most exciting and popular sport of the whole world.
3014	If the teams were forced to spread across the entire field, everybody has more space, which allows for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. I think this would allow for games to be much more higher scoring, therefore making it more exciting and more pleasing for the fans. Hardly any games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be ended.
3015	Let me start by saying I was really into the whole UFO topic for several years. After extensive following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling like it's very likely that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony. So many of the most credible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, so many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar. I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and its all a big coverup but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited. CMV.
3016	There are plenty of credible cases of alien/ufo sightings. As for the military disclosures, they were so overwhelmingly publicised as being clear evidence of UFOs that we no longer believe them, or will doubt their testimony as many people have done. Even people like Sheri Shepherd or Rodney Copper agree the evidence is highly questionable. CMV
3017	All of the accounts of extraterrestrial visitors have been thoroughly discredited as hoaxes. Similarly, most of the credible sources of eyewitness testimony to aliens, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar(claimed to work at Area 51). I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth but I'm not sure if I can think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited. CMV.

3020	Men have traditionally fulfilled the tasks that women are supposed to do. To "be a man" you have to provide for your family, be responsible and protect your family. It's the male equivalent of "be more ladylike".   All it accomplishes is:   * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shit    * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society     It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have those values (if they do, they're told to 'act like a lady'). And god forbid that men have some values that women are'supposed' to have.  Why not have a gender neutral phrase? "Be a better person"?
3021	There are some passages in the Bible that say that women can be leaders. Why can't men as well? All it serves to do is to remind men to fulfil the traditional gender roles.

All it accomplishes is  * Make non-traditionally masculine men feel like shits  * Reaffirm that men are the leaders and protectors of society   It implies that these particular values are men-only, and that women aren't supposed to have these values (if they do, they're told to "act like a lady"). And god forbid that men have some values that women are'supposed' to have.  Why not have a gender neutral phrase, such as "Be a better person"?
3025	Death by starvation is worse than Hell, more or less.
3026	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view, if true causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this.
3027	There should be no argument about whether hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, is a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or in the wrong God. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view is actually causing. We are talking about a scale of billions of people being permanently tortured or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this.

3029	Jesus said 'You shall not kill'; hence all murder, in some form, is wrong. You only kill if it's self-defense. The view that people are obligated to torture prisoners or deny them adequate food and shelter is horrifying but isn't a direct violation of the original Commandment. What's wrong with stating that any and all non-Christian churches should stop invading other countries and creating war, because that is what they are trying to do all around the world?
3030	I'll admit it, I'm a fan of Daisy. I know, I know her voice is irritating, sure. That's your opinion. However, Super Mario Land was the first Mario game I ever beat, and so I have an affinity for her. Beyond that, though, it just makes sense to reuse her at least once. She's a familiar face to anyone who's ever played Mario Kart since the Gamecube. Moreover, now that Nintendo has a habit of sending Mario to places outside of the Mushroom Kingdom, a la Galaxy or 3D World, it would make perfect sense to bring him back to Sarassaland. It lets Peach be a playable character, it justifies her continued presence in spinoffs, and it could make the Mario universe more cohesive. So, please, change my view, because it's never going to happen and I don't want to die sad.

3035	All my life I've been fascinated by economics and money.  I recall spending a lot of time thinking about what qualities a "perfect" money would have, as I see many flaws with the current "candidates" e.g. gold/dollars/euros/etc.  In particular, I see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.  As a consequence of this, I believe that market forces will push more and more resources to Bitcoin (from the inferior monies in the market place) until Bitcoin consumes all of their value and becomes a monopolistic global currency.  I have done a lot of FMA (failure mode analysis) on this, and I feel very confident in the conclusion that this is inevitable. I have invested my life's savings in Bitcoin. Change my mind?

3038	The more I think about it, the more I believe the developments in money are consistent with the natural law of value distribution.  The more we hold onto our money, the more we lose our freedom and our choice.  The more money we have, the more restrictions we put on ourselves and our beliefs.  This poses a problem for the few, but it is an issue that money itself was made to solve.  By implementing Bitcoin, the massive scale of distributions become a powerful force which will rid the system of the flaws in the human mass.  Otherwise, we will never succeed in reaching our true potential.  You see, it is the nature of all things which means the inevitability of change.

3040	I believe that Bill Nye is a much more prominent figure among the younger generation and has the all the skills and knowledge required to create a truly amazing experience while watching the Cosmos series. I am not saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson did a bad job but I believe that it would have been more fitting and symbolic to have Bill Nye who has been fighting so long for knowledge to be heard as the narrator and tour guide of the Cosmos series which will inspire the next generation of thinkers.

3045	It doesn't matter how much you put in. The grades that you get are attributed to your instructor. When someone goes after you it comes across as bullying. Don't seem needy by saying "Thanks," or turn it into an insult by saying, "You owe me this!" Or how about just saying, "I got my grades but I'm not a big fan of this kind of attitude." You are more likely to get an A than a B when you have to work under this pressure.
3046	Don't feel like a dick. In fact, you should be proud of your achievements as they reflect your hard work and dedication. Also, getting good grades is part of the student experience and students go through a similar situation where there is a "superior" to compete against and achieve. Putting this into perspective, it makes you appreciate your academic achievements more and you are less likely to take it personally.
3047	I am not trying to be arrogant, but I can't talk to this with any one of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more planning and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that and I feel it puts pressure on me to just keep at the top.
3048	I don't want this to come across as a humblebrag, but I am studying at university and get good grades. I have achieved mostly First Class grades this semester while my friends get 2:1s and 2:2s.   It has become an expectation that I achieve Firsts, and therefore when I do score highly on work I receive replies such as "of course" or "is that it?" jokingly from my peers.   I am not trying to be arrogant, but I can't talk to this with any one of the guys on the course. They feel like I should be 'grateful' for my grades, despite the fact I put substantially more planning and writing time into the work I submit. In the past I have usually had a peer to compete with, but I am lacking that and I feel it puts pressure on me to just keep at the top. I am I just being a dick or am I justified in feeling that my achievements are undermined by people expecting that I get top grades?
3049	Being a dick is not something a university student should be. It's just silly. Just come out and talk to them about it, and tell them how you feel. Also, if they want you to work harder, then work harder because they expect you to. If you didn't work hard, they would have to say you worked hard, not just keep expecting you to do it.
3050	Just completed a marathon of the new installments, and for my money the first three episodes were just more enjoyable. The story was quite rich, the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV. There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul and Obi-Wan dueling, Anakin vs Obi-Wan, Jango Fett. New ones are slow, linear and dumb. We accept now that much of what we accept as standard fare for sci-fi was off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes were more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.   Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.  I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar). I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of star wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three.

3054	So basically he didn't say that Palpatine had nothing to do with the war and the destruction of Alderaan and Bespin and the destruction of the Jedi Academy.
3055	If this dark genre is continued to prosper, our youth will be affected negatively. There are too many stars in this genre who are living an evil lifestyle so they spread bad ideas to other youth! The lifestyles of it's stars will be more focusable as they spread evil ideas, and could be an example for the youth.
3056	Music is evil because of the genre and the lifestyles of some of its artists. Most of them are sinful, evil, and do not follow the religion. I believe that it is because of the genre, not because of the style.
3057	First of all, the symbolism it contains can be interpreted as evil even by a 5th grader! If this dark genre is continued to prosper, our youth will be affected negatively! Next, the lifestyles of its artists. Most of them live very sinful and evil lifestyles. Is it because of the genre? I believe so.

3060	When voting to impeach a president, because of numerous instances of "misinformation" given, or possibly not as a result of, that president should be impeached. Remember this: while Bush is not currently the worst, he is among the worst, and we must find someone more competent with the politics and world affairs of the United States of America that will bring us into this time of need for leadership, albeit only for two years. With that, let us vote PRO to impeach Bush, a committed war criminal who has committed crimes against the people of the United States of America.
3061	Yes, the president should be impeached. Ladies and gentlemen, if you are not aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that George W. Bush, because of multiple instances of "misinformation" that was given, or possibly not as a result of, we must all agree that George W. Bush us one that should be impeached.

3065	The gold standard is inflexible and too slow in growth, thus it is unable to catch up with our economy. Banks will fail, destroying our economy. There is no IRS, government loses income, stopping our ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust ourselves out of recession and overheat, annihilating the moderator system of our economy. There is no question, Japan should quit, because there is a reason the last military practice for NKR was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
3066	I think it is problematic to speak of the global recession as a ‘bubble economy’. The recession is not a bubble, but a lot of bubble, and there will be more.
3067	Gold is inflexible and too slow in growth. It will not catch up to our economy. Also, banks will fail, destroying our economy. No IRS: government loses income, stopping our ability to carry out fiscal policy and adjust ourselves out of recessions and overheat, annihilating the moderator system of our economy. Quit UN: I don't know why he wants to do this. Something with the debt. But the UN membership fee won't cause a big debt. Quit Japan: There is a reason the last military practice for NKR was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
3068	There is a reason the last military practice for North Korea was to shoot a missile over Japan. I wonder what they were practicing for.
3069	No IRS in government will stop the "great moderator system" of our economy. As for the last military practice for Korea, I don't have an answer for you. But if you are to promote a big debt in the UN, it won't bring us benefits. No military practice for Japan is actually most likely a good thing, because the military practice for Korea could be a bit intense in such case. Also, the reason why NKR let the US enjoy a warm hand for 10 years was because the ROK had a lot of geostrategic importance, and none of them has since the Japanese occupation.
3070	People always keep their opinions about religion. Because, they were raised that way and no matter how many arguments atheists have with religious man, they will keep their opinion because they were also brought up that way.
3071	Religious people say "God is here. I don't know how or why, but God is here and we must obey." Atheists say "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." And we're back to square one...

3074	Anytime religion has turned into a bigoted, twisted timewaster... and mainstream religion puts mindless, fatally stupid dogma at the forefront, its time to turn off the TV.
3075	Absolutely nothing except for our curiosity about what our universe began as. What practical application is there in knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than a sense of curiosity, what could we hope to gain when the world is suffering being torn apart by war, starving, job loss on the rise? Which is not to say I am not curious about space, I am. But we need to focus our resources on fixing what is wrong here on Earth before we go chasing the curios of the galaxy.
3076	Yes, of course, there is a great application. Moreover, we should surely focus on fixing things on Earth before we go chasing the curiosity of the galaxy.
3077	Is there any real application or use for knowing whether or not there was life on Mars? Other than curiosity what could we hope to gain by the world is suffering being torn apart by war, starvation, job loss on the rise? It is only called curiosity because we are only interested in it for its own sake, but we need to focus our resources on fixing what is wrong here on earth before we go chasing the curiosity of the galaxy.
3078	Because we are facing a great deal of problems here on Earth. So we should invest our resources on what we have and how we can solve the problems right here.
3079	Curiosity is great, but it has been shown, not without controversy, that there is life on Mars. Which means we have an important goal: save our planet.
3080	No, NASA keeps looking for asteroids because it's the job of NASA. Also, it's the job of NASA to look for asteroids.
3081	Our universe will not end in 2012, NASA keeps looking for it. We won't get hit because we think that it will 3,000 years in the future. The funny thing is that they made a bet with my friend if the world doesn't end in 2012 i get $5 if it does he gets $5. He said "if we see the asteroids I'll pay up". I can't wait for those $5 lol. The Master Chief
3082	Probably not. Because NASA is making sure it doesnt hit the earth with asteroids.
3083	No, the world will not end. NASA keeps looking and we won't get hit for it thinks it was 3,000 years ago. The funny thing is made a bet with my friend if the world doesn't end in 2012 I get $5 if it does he gets $5 he said "if we see the asteroids we have to pay up" i can't wait for those $5 LOL
3084	Our main goal at this point, is to keep aliens out and not to destroy Earth, hopefully.
3085	Yes I do believe so because I live in Jamaica. Yes, I definitely believe so. Within reason of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.

3090	my friend is being stupid. she'll be moving to Texas, where she's in the minority. In Texas, 13% of the entire town is white. Most of the town is gang territory. Not far from the Mexican border. Leaving everything behind, including family and friends. Most people tell her to stay. What do you think?

3095	Sheldon skipped from grade 4 to grade 10 by cheating and did not succeed in learning the material for grade 10. The teachers were surprised because he was not well educated at all. TJ had a clear consciousness about facts and he did not have any fear of the teachers. He took any arguments that he did not understand he was able to hack into numerous things. He won a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown up debaters who are usually as smart as him.
3096	Sheldon was smarter than TJ at a younger age. He skipped classes at a younger age and had difficulty with school work. Also, he taught the grade 10 class and got into arguments with teachers and he was always right. TJ was able to hack into numerous things. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart maybe as smart a Sheldon.
3097	Sheldon was smarter than TJ because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from grade 4 to grade 10 and was able to hack into numerous things. He even went on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with grown adults that were very smart. Maybe as smart as TJ.
3098	Sheldon had an IQ of 180 when he was ten and didn't have to enter a traditional school at the age of four. He skipped grades and was able to hack into numerous things. Also, he got into arguments with teachers and was always right. Also, he was in the Cross Talk debating show. Maybe he couldn't hack the security systems at that age.
3099	Sheldon is smarter than TJ because he had an IQ of 180 at the age of 10. He skipped from grade 4 to grade 10 and had no trouble doing the work. Teachers liked him because he was always right in arguments. He was even on a debate show called Cross Talk and was able to win debates easily with adults that were very smart. TJ was able to hack into numerous things and also be able to hack into a lot of problems for people so he was able to fix things even when other people didn't understand. He also wrote into multiple problems and knew everything that he taught so he was very good at fixing the problems and was a very smart person.
3100	As tempting as the "week debate" pun is (and it is!).... Doesn't it rather hard that the year supposedly starts in the middle of winter, so that each year gets TWO winters? Why would we want to split up our weekend so that it's only one day long on each end? A work-week is five days, then two days of play; lather, rinse, and repeat. Or take the "week" off and go skiing, but that's neither here nor there.

But window-dressing aside, the week starts on Monday.

3105	From the moment I walked in, there was already something wrong with my experience. No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. Once I sat down the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates. Horrible experience and would never go again.
3106	It is a little hard to understand because the cook said they did not have a platt when they had five customers there. Also, the MC says they were not able to serve us because there were no plates. However, at that time, it was not possible to ask for plates because I went into the crowded area as a sandwich person and stayed there without asking. When I had to leave the place to find a new place to eat, I took a sabbatical and spent two weeks traveling all over Greece without a place to eat. And at the end, I didn't go anywhere because I only ate good food in Greece and was completely satisfied with it.
3107	Its very unprofessional and unsanitary to serve alcohol while out and about. They should cover what you are consuming and offer you a clean, sealed can of beer or something. You could now carry one and replenish. There are several options here.

3110	There's a short line so don't let the long line scare you away...
3111	Singapore is an island country in Southeast Asia that's over 200km long. The weather is very hot and humid in summer and chilly and dry in winter. There's a tropical monsoon climate.
3112	In all honest honest i don't think this sandwich is really worth all the hype i have seen it on other websites. It is by far, my least favourite sandwich when i stop by there. Its either wrong or on one side but not great. The turkey on the other hand is amazing! The sandwich looked very runny and thin but this is just my perception. I do believe i may be able to get it next time but ill stick to the full meridian u all know what i mean
3113	Book shops are a terrible use of resources. They should be auctioned off to the highest bidder after they are gone under or closed.
3114	Can´t believe I didn’t write a review for this place Located inside the Planet Hollywood and its open 24/7. Great place to go to when you have the munchies while you are touring Hollywood. Recommendations: Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich. Holiday Turkey..Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey. Original...Just Ok..Its beef sandwich and it was nothing special. Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey. All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!! They also have salads and soups. Line moves pretty quickly so donot let the long line scare you away...
3115	If the new layout is a success, there will be no need for a Starbucks Ice Blended and a bag of Rice Krispies treats. As soon as the meal comes around and you notice how utterly banal everything is. No bread fresh out of the oven, no premium-grade Cheetos chips, no EggTost, no vigorous buttering of the individual breadsticks. I will recommend moving them from here to a place like Subway.
3116	This place's idea about individual portions is pretty awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!

3118	This place's idea about individual portions is really great. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. They put very little on the plate, in fact, you can eat everything that you see (though that's kinda weird, but they were pretty careful about it) and service was nice. The only negative was that we didn't like the hot salads as much, as the ones in our state. I'd like to come back to try for dinner, as we didn't eat breakfast here.

3120	Raising Cane's is a good choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.

3123	This establishment is a popular choice for many customers, especially those craving a delicious meal within a price range they can afford. They offer a variety of delicious options that are fairly priced. They have a great dining area where customers can relax while waiting for their meal to be prepared. This establishment also has a drive-thru option where customers can feed themselves very quickly. Overall, it's a nice place to eat in a great price.

3125	Exploring Books is an amazing resource. The staff is super friendly and provides free sample books to visitors. The manager, Catherine, can even help you identify whether you have a potential writer on your hands. The library is literally walking distance away on Bethlehem Street. I love it, you must check it out as well!
3126	Once you check it out, you won't want to go anywhere else!
3127	We can't sing new ways' praises enough. We live a hop, skip and jump away from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome as well as the hot italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!
3128	Right. See what I mean? I have no problem with these people. I thought I did, but it turns out I'm not, and I want them jailed forever. Yet the law is letting these “Christian holier-than-thou” characters rape innocent girls into oblivion because they want to get out on the weekend.
3129	Despite the fact that this restaurant is a nice option you may have to wait until 8pm as there is not much to eat so it might be inconvenient if you have to work early. Also, if you can visit you are paying for a tiny portion of food. Try their sausage melt which will be filled with your choice of sausage. I wish there were more options there.
3130	We've gone twice now and won't be going back again. The first time, it was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd gove them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 minute wait to be seated, another 15 minutes for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 minutes for someone to come ring us up. She asks how it was and we told her it was awful, she said sorry, $34.24" we should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
3131	There was a great steak for $2.75 off at Tuck n chill in Trader joe's today....
3132	The steak we ordered was horrible, it was extremely dry. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. We left very mad, because it takes almost an hour to order food and another hour to get it. I would have walked out, because I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.
3133	It's a shame that being seated at a restaurant takes more than 20 minutes. Being greeted by a rude person should not take 7 minutes. We suggest you just walk out of there before it starts getting ugly.
3134	Going to a steakhouse twice in one week is a mistake, as it will only make you put your meal aside. The first time, it was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd gove them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 min wait to be seated, another 15 for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare.

3135	 Pizza was okay. 9.99 for a medium pizza. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menu's. You had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. The pizza would take about 9 minutes. The food quality was a 97.5
3136	To go pizza was alright. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes.

3138	For pizza? $4.50. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. The sanitation score was a 97.5.
3139	What is a "menu"? Menu is just a list or a plan. Food prices vary, and most restaurants will not give you an exact price before you agree to go there. Waiting times can be as little as 10 seconds or as long as 8 minutes. Food can be fast or slow. A score of 97.5 is not something we would expect from a fast food restaurant.
3140	All students should be allowed to express themselves. And with the uniform, well they are all the same... that's boring.
3141	Teachers should be allowed to express themselves as well. Students should also be allowed to express themselves and with uniform, well, they're all the same, that's boring.
3142	Students should be allowed to express themselves. They should be allowed to wear what they like, but not all the same. That's boring.

3145	American public schools are bad for children. In fact, many teachers do not have the necessary qualifications to teach. They would much rather go to night school. It's a terrible system. Teachers are making a living
3146	It is ok to be free with noone telling you what to do.
3147	I think their bad because we should be free with out somebody telling us what to do.
3148	Girls should be free to do whatever they want to do. No one should tell them what to do.
3149	There should be no argument for or against a ban of deodorants. They should be free to use without anyone telling them what to do.
3150	Students in uniform schools don't suffer the same type of bullying that those who don't wear uniforms have to go through. Since you talk about bullying and the way that uniform schools deal with this issue, it's important to note that it's a very rare occurrence here in this country. If I have to believe the book, I would say that we could be in the top 5 countries with the least amount of bullying in the world because of school uniforms. Kids will find other reasons to bully and offend others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express themselves.
3151	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
3152	In reality, bullying of any kind isn't anything to be concerned about. Kids find other ways to engage in this form of violence and abuse. Bullying isn't addressed when you promote a style of uniform and "individuality" on a school campus. The kids will just use an alternative to bullying other students by inducing them into this style of clothing. Kids will find other things to bully other students. It doesn't address the bullying side of the issue.
3153	One reason school uniforms is used is to reduce bullying which in reality does not even address the bullying problem. The only good it does is to get rid of or reduce bullying because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate as the IN thing to wear. While bullying is a problem all it does is get rid of or reduce one the most basic types of bullying. Kids will find other ways to bully others and it also infringes on the basic rights of them as individuals and express their individuality
3154	We can reduce the bullying that is experienced by some children if we make uniforms a bit more unique. For example, a student who is wearing a jacket of uniform style and meets someone wearing a long sleeve dress shirt can easily come off as both being disruptive and grinchy and make a situation between them that could end in bullying. If a uniform made other students and teachers aware of this student, however, it would not only deter any bullying or misbehavior, but would also allow that student to choose the appropriate clothing.
3155	It is wrong that students are not allowed to express themselves because it is only by expressing that they can become smart.
3156	Students have the right to feel and express their feelings and opinions however they want to it. It's important to learn through the use of action and observation, not through thoughts and theories.
3157	Students have the right to feel and express, but that's wrong. It's the learning which makes us smart.
3158	Students have the right to feel and express their feelings and viewpoints, but it's wrong for a student to make personal attacks on classmates.
3159	Students' right way to feel is wrong because learning makes them smart.
3160	When you're out of college or high school or whatever, like in a office. You have to choose your own clothing.
3161	You should choose your own clothing when you are out of college, high school or office.

3165	Internet Explorer sucks!!! Its so slow, things don't click, it's laggy, it's out of date, it is older, and most important it sucks!!! The only thing that doesn't suck about Internet Explorer is the non-existent search. No good sites search. I am with Firefox... any URL I enter, I can reach it within 5 seconds. Plus it searches the entire internet for the content on a website that I type, and in this matter, Internet Explorer should learn how fast!
3166	It depends on the system, whether Firefox is better or not. Some Microsoft based computer user find Internet Explorer better, so they prefer Firefox. Some Apple, asian, or Linux based computer user like Internet Explorer, so they prefer Firefox.
3167	Anything that works for a person individually, is good. How would I be able to say something is the best, when it doesn't work on someone elses' computer? I vote for Firefox, because in my experience, it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The configuration isn't too bad, and those of you who know about about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and there are many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer. Especially after the laughable 7 update. ;D
3168	Generally I like browsers that stay relatively similar. IE just sometimes blows me away with it's lack of potential and lack of foresight. Like when you download some low priced MS Office that comes with an IE skin on it. Nothing would happen if you didn't know how to tell the difference. Firefusa seem to have the most potential in the software field, with the latest stable, 10, to come out soon. Although it's still running very unstable still. This is for those who love a stable browser that is fun to use and features that other may not.
3169	My personal preference is Internet Explorer, because my computer has terrible internet connectivity that would be a miserable experience with any other browser. I haven't experienced all the cool features that Firefox has though.
3170	FF has had a high market share since day one and nothing I have ever done changed that.
3171	Since when is Firefox an Apple fad? There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. If you are "original and free minded", why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? Its not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.
3172	For an individual or business to use any OS it might like there has to be some reality to it. Windows doesn't even have a market share as high as some other OSes yet much more individuals or businesses use it.
3173	There haven't been more Windows than Mac firefox downloads since day one. How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? Firefox isn't even a choice for people that prefer originality! It's a choice for people that value network security and privacy.

3175	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.
3176	My wife is not my property. I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.
3177	I would not turn my wife in for lying because I love her and I married her for a reason. I would trust her that she killed someone, because murder is still murder. Gene Hackman killed the guy his wife was cheating with.
3178	If you had my wife, I wouldn't trust her and would not turn her in to the police to solve the case. I would rather trust her that she killed someone for a good reason relatively because murder is still murder. Gene Hackman killed the man her wife was cheating with.
3179	You should never turn your wife in because you love her and you married her for a reason. You should always trust your wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene Hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.
3180	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmm...it depends on the person. But if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a tough problem
3181	All of a sudden my love's head popped up from the car behind and said to my ears: "*hi*" Then her shirt unrolled and we kissed on the cheek. we continued our journey to the wedding where we happened to meet my deceased soon-to-be ex-husband. If I remembered correctly this girl told me her ex-husband would be there so I took advantage of my first kiss with a girl. Now this might not make sense to anyone who may see this blog. But this was the timeline of the kiss and it was all weird. My death right before the wedding? and on the second anniversary of our wedding day? All I got was:*boink**boink*. I didn't remember kissing her.
3182	Well I definitely would stay in my wedding vows through thick and thin as long as I loved my husband but in times where a person is just poorly blinded by emotional forces, it can be just the opposite of true love. Yes, I mean I made a promise to my husband, but in times like that I can easily see some people would turn to me for help when they couldn't find the right direction and I would be there for them till the end of time, while people would turn from me like there was nothing. Yes that's the hardest one I have faced.

3190	TV is better because it will bring you live news and TV is better than books because most of the TV kids watch add influences to them which are not good and most parents don't care what there children watch. So, books are better than TV.
3191	Being against TV is better than being against books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
3192	You can go to a book store and purchase any book for free and read about anything. So if you do like science fiction, please stop criticizing books.
3193	It depends on what we are talking about. There are very good benefits to read books and watching TV. There are also negative aspects for both.
3194	TV is better than books because most of the TV kids watch add influences to them which are not good and most parents don't care what there children watch and I thank book are better because you learn more from books.
3195	I'm student of class 11 and I have to take part in a debate tournament. That's why I asked you, please give me more information. I will be very grateful to you.
3196	It is a great opportunity for you to improve your skills and experience, which can be valuable for future employment

3200	As the population increases, the need for land decreases, and land decreases create large population on every place. India is able to win gold medal of corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, violence, etc.
3201	The increasing population means more land, and more land means a big crowd on every place. India can win a gold medal of corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, violence, etc.
3202	India is able to win gold medal because India has increasing population and less land. India lacks land, and more people then can settle there. India is a huge country so it is affected by many hazards.
3203	India will always be able to win gold medals of corrosion, terrorism, ill-iteracy, violence, etc.
3204	Unfortunately, the increasing population also means less land. India cannot win the medal of corrosion, terrorism, illiteracy, violence, etc.
3205	If you don't want a dad to become involved with you, why try and make it work out, if you already know that it's not going to last and don't want a dad that does nothing for you to continue to work with you?
3206	Being a kid without a dad is hard because you may not be able to get any advice, but you are not going to be able to get money from your dad either, so why try to make it work out with someone you already know what the outcome is.
3207	I think if you have a dad that does nothing for you, it means you are so dominant that he doesn’t care, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
3208	I think if I had a father that didn't do anything for me I wouldn't want him around because odds are you and him aren't going to be talking five years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
3209	If I had a dad who did nothing for me, I'd not want him around because odds are you and him aren't going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try to make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.
3210	It can be either way. But I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father. Sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.

I am used to being alone with my mother without my father there because he passed away when I was six, so I really don't have a favorite side.
3215	It depends on the situation. If your lousy father or fatherless, I think it's not as big as you think. Also, maybe you might follow your father or your fatherless or a lousy father, as long as they help you correct your mistakes. I don't like being fatherless because I like having a father.
3216	I'm more comfortable if I am a fatherless kid but if I'm a lousy father then that's also fine because I can learn from you if I'm a fatherless. If I am a fatherless, he can also encourage me to be a successful in life and it won't be bad influence from him too. It's fine if I be a fatherless rather than a lousy father because I can learn from the situation if I am fatherless.
3217	Being fatherless and having fathers at the same time is a good and bad thing. It's both good because your father would be there to help you and bad because he might not be supportive.
3218	Being a fatherless is not good or bad. It all depends on who your father is. If you like him you are having a fatherless life. But if you don't like him, he is a fatherless life. He might make you take an entirely wrong path. But, if he is a good father and keeps his promises, being a fatherless is definitely okay and he would give you good advice and help you grow. So long as you don't hate him and never regret whatever you did.
3219	Being a fatherless is ok, but not good because you might not like being a fatherless as long as you are a lousy father or fatherless. As long as you are a lousy father or fatherless, they can encourage you to success in life and help you correct your mistake that you had made.
3220	It wouldn't be acceptable for the government to force parents to give their children for adoption because it's their decision to raise and take care of the child.
3221	If one is fatherless and doesn't have a good father then it doesn't make sense to have one. His like the alpha male, and a good father looks forward to his and is supposed to solve all the problems that come his way. So why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.
3222	If it's assumed that you're a fatherless child that's okay, but if you're a good father but no one knows it, then you have all this responsibility and strife's of what people expect of you. The same reason as if you're having a lousy father in the first place that comes into the picture is to keep the family afloat and going to that you could become estranged from your family and relationships and have lousy support. That's why support should be given to you so that you could carry on with the responsibilities your lousy father left you with.
3223	If your father is unattractive or failed in his life then you shouldn't waste your time being with him because you don't need a father that failed in his career to be to step up for you and protect you. This would be more beneficial for you to be with a nice upstanding man instead of a failed one.
3224	The more you tell yourself a lie, the more it becomes a truth. For example, if you tell yourself your father isn't going to be there, you may not see him anymore because you probably thought the lies told to you.
3225	As a young man it is important that you have someone to support you and push you to be successful in life.
3226	As a young boy you grow hoping and that they have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.
3227	By being born as a young boy you grow, and hope to have a father figure in your life to be there when you need him. The last thing you want is for someone to live with you that doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer any questions you may need to know.

3234	Singapore saw a vision that was designed for an orderly, elegant, rational and modern society and he worked hard to bring it about. During his time, Mr Farquhar worked at disorganising Singapore, causing Raffles to feel disappointed.
3235	Although Farquhar was said to be the one who stayed in Singapore to support its development, Raffles was the one to give planning, strategizing and choose Singapore as another British base and gave support to the British and if William Farquhar was to be proclaimed the founder, shouldn't the supervisor of a construction site get more commission instead of the contractor? And besides, Raffles left Singapore under the orders of his superiors and he didn't leave of his free will.

3240	William Farquhar was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also with the Sultan Hussien. I agree that the Sultan Hussien was the one who remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but William Farquhar was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen. Also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's development so he should be considered a founder.

3250	"The plan conceived by Raffles consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups. The main areas are east, west and middle zones. Besides, there were an agricultural area, land for government buildings and roads." The town plan is referred to as de Nieuwe Haven. The Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles and chaired by his brother, Francis Macartney.
3251	Respected Sir, This is to inform you that we are returning the space you occupies on Facebook. First, there is a little space for you where there is no one. Second, you are just standing on the bridge no one can get to your feet because the small space you occupy is not big enough. Third, your opinion does not matter, so quit. Lastly, we have more spaces in our company already and you can go up there. No we are not making jokes. So I want you to go. And give the space up to others.
3252	Richard Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a town plan committee was formed by Richard Raffles to oversee the project.
3253	Singapore was planned by Louis XIII of France. However, when Raffles arrived there, he made much bigger plans and thus began the success of Singapore.
3254	After few months, he consulted a trade master named Thompson who seems to be the most capable town planner in that era.

3260	In case there is one you were in those conditions in just one month, I believe you would catch a disease every single day. Hospitals were very limited and there were some if that would have been buildings to house the patients, there would have been no risk of catching the disease. Also, it was beneficial to one thing Raph built a raffle and that has helped people in that area. Another thing about his help to development
3261	If you go live in a fasted olden time conditions in just one month in those conditions it would be a surprise if you did not catch a disease every single day. Hospitals were one thing that lighted the fire. Also, social programs built would have saved so many people in those times because the living there were conditions were bad. Another reason he has helped on the development of society and allowed a path to modern life.

3263	In the olden time conditions, I guess there were only one day that everyone would not get a disease, in those days, there would be hospitals, and people would not died in the wild because of the living conditions. Just imagine, a king would have gone on a hunt and he would have caught a wild animal in his trap. In the end he would not bring it back alive because he didn't have the necessary medical care. Another example would be if a severe catwalk crisis or any other crisis, the king would have chosen a domesticated animal that he could get help from and in the end the animal would have lost its life. Other examples of life that might be saved by a domestic
3264	In the olden times when conditions were bad, in just one month it would be a surprise if people didn't catch a disease every day, hospitals were built, the public had to pay for such hospitals, and that would have saved so many people in that time. Another reason why the development of an invention may have helped on the development is that he lived in conditions.
3265	Crack cocaine is a drug that people crave for but that is not harmless. It is addictive. It is not healthy to use it. However, ciggarettes are not addictive, unhealthy and you shouldn't smoke them, it's just wrong.
3266	Do you agree that it's wrong? Yes, it's wrong. Does it make you unhealthy? Yes, it does. Is it addictive? Yes. However, just because it's wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
3267	Yes, smoking ciggarettes is wrong, unhealthy and addictive. Just because it’s wrong doesn’t mean it can’t exist.
3268	Is it wrong? Yes. Unhealthy? Yes. Addictive? Yes. But so is cigarettes. Just because it is wrong doesn't mean that it shouldn't exist.
3269	Yes, it's wrong to smoke and unhealthy to smoke and addictive to smoke, just like cigarettes are. But, smoking is different than drinking and driving. I'm not saying we should stop drinking and driving, but why give the mentally ill a free pass.

Seriously, it exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships.

3275	God created us and then optimized us by evolution. we will find out within 100 years anyways.
3276	God created us in his image. Then he used evolution to perfect us. We can find out if evolution is true or not in a hundred years.
3277	I believe that God created us on this earth and tweaked us via evolution over time and that we will all find out within 100 years. Anyways, this needs to be asked!
3278	k, I believe that 'God' created all living creatures and then tweaked them via evolution. We will all find out within 100 years that we don't need God to explain life on Earth.
3279	God created human beings then nurtured them by providing all that they needed for their survival for 100,000 years without the need of a god, then through evolution tweaked them over the last 20,000 years to be the beings we see today, similar to how
3280	True, both moth colors have always been there. It just depends on which color makes it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution, it's just a diet plan.
3281	In any case, peppered moth is a type of moth. This proves nothing. Its color could have something to do with its easier for its prey to see, but it could also be that all moths have a more attractive color. There is only a change in diet for the prey to see this. Also, I suggest you learn about evolution before posting these mind-boggling statements- there is still not proof that something has evolved, there is only a correlation of information, so you must have studied that before you can say that. This is only proof of a very intuitive
3282	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument. I'm very familiar with it. I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process. Both moth colors have always been there. Its a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- that's a diet plan.
3283	I don't think peppered moths reflect evolution. There are many other reptile species that have two different coloring schemes and they are very complex creatures. So evolutionary process isn't always affected by physical features.
3284	Ah yes, The classic peppered moth argument. I'm very familiar with it. I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process. Both moth colors have always been there. Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution, that's a diet plan.
3285	This is not an argument against evolution as an explanation for the origin of life. For one thing, I haven't proven anything about it. I have just proposed one way that the origin of life could have happened. We may

3287	If you want to see the evolution of the mouse you have to imagine it as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.

3290	I'm not an Internet Explorer user, but the issues Firefox has have time with. First, it takes a lot of time to load when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 year old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera, which takes much less time to start. Plugins I frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perform well in Firefox, and the flash movie often stops in Firefox unlike in Opera, which plays flash movies smoothly. Lastly, Firefox is still young, and I guess it's much better than Internet Explorer. However, for me Opera is still the best browser.
3291	The extra 10 seconds of delay for FF3 to load is like the wait time to attend a movie at the theater. Also, like opera, flash players work well and smooth in firefox. I like FF3 however I highly dislike Ffx2 for lack of performance in some features. That is: generally faster, more features and many other things.
3292	IMHO FF is better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
3293	Other browsers such as Opera, Vivaldi, Google Chrome have a lot of issues such as not starting quickly when loaded from the disk. Flash movie often stops playing in FFX unlike in Opera. So for my purposes and the average person, I still prefer Opera to Firefox.
3294	Foxie is newer than IE, and sometimes it is better because it has plug-ins to make it work better such as Flash Player. However, in FFX it doesn't work as well as Opera, so I have to switch back to Opera.
3295	Emotions aside, Firefox doesn't have ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool Windows VirtualEarth.
3296	Firefox lacks active X support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth.
3297	(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth.
3298	(I am writing this through Firefox) I don't like Windows VirtualEarth because it doesn't have ActiveX support and thus is only usable with Internet Explorer.
3299	Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth.
3300	Chorme is faster and safer than firefox. Plus, it is open-source like Firefox.
3301	Chrome is better than Fire Fox because Chrome is the fastest and the safest browser, but it's also open source.
3302	Chorme is more stable and faster then FF. Plus is open source and easy to customize.
3303	Chrome is faster than firefox because chromebook is based on open source code. And it's also faster because it's based on chrome's code.
3304	Chromebook is more than 10 times faster than the the fastest and the safest. On the same order. And that's open source like firefox.

3313	Well, the founder of Singapore was Raffles and he was the one that played the role of a'mother' to Singapore. He contributed more to Singapore than Quarles and even though Quarles only supported his claim that he was the founder, Farquhar really supported the fact that Raffles was the one and it made it easier for them to adhere

3315	Abortion is never something that a woman would take lightly. There will always be a lot of thinking about it, asking for help, and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seem to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope no one would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. so it should be left to the women and not some man miles away in Washington, D.C. who has never faced it.
3316	Women should be in charge of their own bodies and that's about the only sensible thing I hear about. Not some man miles away who doesn't have to face it but is some distant individual who needs to act paternalistic and even stand in the corner like an emancipated supportive authority figure for a person who doesn't have the right.
3317	Im going to take the Obama approach to this abortion is never something a woman would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking, asking for help and even prayer involved with making that decision.

3318	We would like to see people have the right to make abortion decisions based on the woman’s best interests. This can lead to issues when the woman’s opinions don’t line up with the world.
3319	Pro-life, pro choice people do not seem to understand that there are many women who are going to turn their backs on the first abortion and and insist on making it a conscious decision to proceed. They think they are helping when they tell them they are leaving it up to them to decide. We pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. Therefore, it should be left to the women and not some man miles away in the capitol that has never faced it.
3320	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should be able to make the choice to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one of those circumstances. It should be allowed to make the choice she wants.
3321	If a woman is raped and left with a bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the choice to give up the baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, her choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
3322	This is one case that calls for desperate decisions and this is one choice that should be made by the woman, and she should be allowed to make it.
3323	When a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the right to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.

3325	This is a personal view, not an official policy. What matters to pregnant women is their own decision and it is not the behavior of the society that must decide what to do.
3326	Abortion is not always the right decision for mothers. They must decide what to do with their child.
3327	Being a mother is the most wonderful feeling one can ever have. I don't believe that people should be able to do something like killing their child. It is a mother's right to do as she pleases.
3328	Personally, I am against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother is what she thinks or what most of the people think about it. She must decide what to do with her child.
3329	I'm personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right to choose. What matters to a pregnant mother what I think or what most of the people thinks about it. She must decide what to do with her child.
3330	In the USA, pro-choice is the only constitutional way. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.

3335	How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church, Sunday school, or prayer meetings before or during meals or while at school or at night? I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.
3336	How can that be? How were you brought up? Did you go to church, Sunday school, pray before meals? Pray at school, pray at night? I remember my 7th grade art class when I began questioning the Lord’s Prayer in school. And God. It didn’t make sense, and then, thanks to my public school system, stopped.
3337	How can you say you are brainwashed? Where did you learn to pray? Did you go to church or Sunday school or pray before meals or pray at school or pray at night? I don't remember having to say the Lord's Prayer in school but I don't think it taught my kids about God either.
3338	Is God real or existential? Do you really think our God was nice to us when he punished us for breaking his commandments? No. He has a great deal of leniency.
3339	Where have you been brainwashed? Did you go to church and was that Sunday School? Pray before meals and pray at school? Pray at night? I remember when I was 7, and I questioned the Lord's Prayer in school. I guess my public school system stopped that practice.
3340	There is no concrete evidence that supports that god exists. Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence. Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations.
3341	There is no concrete evidence that supports that there is any god. Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and have changes.

3343	There isn't any concrete evidence to support that God exists. Religion and the Bible have too many contradictions and changes to make me more and less convinced that God exists. Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment and over large amounts of time evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations.
3344	No hard evidence supports that God exists. Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes. Evolution makes more sense to me. Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve to be able to survive through different climates and situations.
3345	The common good is a better goal than individual one because it is better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people your hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
3346	I think that common good is a better idea because giving is better then receiving. Giving is better then receiving from yourself because you think that giving is a good way to live your life and help others. Giving people you're hand out in help is a better way to live and help others than holding your own hand.
3347	It's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
3348	Being giving and helping others is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people your hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
3349	It should not be shown as it is the best example of this method. Better to help other people then to benefit from them. It's better to give other peoples hands out in help then you holding your own hand.
3350	Both exploration and preservation of our environment are important because neither alone can be fully achieved. As a society, we should educate all about each as well, since neither is properly appreciated and understood by all.
3351	Both entrepreneurship and social responsibility are important. I think that it can be that I will become part of both in this life to make this whole society healthier,morally upright and way better than it used to be.Everyone knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but other people will help to make this world safer and better. To teach them that they can do as a wealthy person.
3352	Both societies are better to be part of. But I as an individual would like to advance the common good in this society. To become unpetty with each other, to do things way better than they used to. Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but other will help the community to make it safe and better. To teach them what they are capable of, to believe in themselves that they can do as the things wealthy people does.
3353	Both ventures are better to be part of but I as an individual, I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other, to do things way better than they use to. Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but other would help the community to make it safe and better. To teach them what they are capable of, to believe in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.
3354	There should be no argument in this. The common good in society is to make it safe and better. People should work together to improve the world and learn what they are capable of. Believing in themselves and to make it better.
3355	Advocating the common good is better to me. If I pursued my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good because most of them would be selfish choices that would hurt someone else. I do not like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else's well being before thinking about ourselves.
3356	Doing good to others is better to me because, If I pursued my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good. Most of them would be selfish choices that would end up hurting someone else. I don't like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
3357	To advance the common good is a better policy to me than to pursue my own personal pursuit, because if I were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be good for society because most of my actions would be selfish choices and would result in hurting people. I don’t like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
3358	advancing the common good is better for me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good. Because most of them would be selfish choices that will end up hurting someone else. I don't like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we thought about our selves.
3359	For me, advancing the common good is better because if I pursued my own personal pursuit, it would not be all that good because most of them would be selfish choices that would end up hurting someone else, I don't like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
3360	Student victimization should be lowered as there is less competition in wearing the most fashionable clothing.
3361	I think that student victimization is likely to be decreased and fights and gang activity will be decreased, as there is less competition in regard to clothing.
3362	Student victimization is likely to be lowered and fights and gang activity should be decreased, as there is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
3363	The students will be better off since they will have less conflict among peers and less gang activity.
3364	Student victimization is likely to be lowered and fights and gang activity should be decreased as there is less competition in regard to wearing the most fashionable clothing.
3365	Uniforms are important because they make it easier for students to identify with each other and not with the teacher. If students didn't think the teacher had power over them, they wouldn't use school uniforms. In the morning we should use our uniform and if we didn't use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student. If we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school.
3366	United States of America is a developed country. All the citizens of this country are united under laws which govern everyone. We receive some kind of education that makes us discipline workers and ambitious for achieving something. We have the political liberties of a country and we have our own identity. Our country has many natural resources which help in our economy. Our nation has developed a software of evaluating all the income payments and having a balanced budget. We have free information and communication technology for our electronic transactions. All the citizens of this country like to love and respect their land and their own homeland which is the United States of America. All the citizens of this country like their country to be full of happiness. When all the citizens of this country live in peace and harmony with each other then this country will be called an ideal country which is what we are working hard to make it. Our goal is to develop our country to the highest level of happiness in the world. Our goal is to develop our country to the highest level of education in the world. Our goal is to develop our country to the highest level of arts in the world. Our goal is to develop our country to the highest level of technology in the world. Our goal is to develop our country to the highest level of clean water
3367	School uniform is a logo for our school to remind us that we are part of the school. If we use our uniform, basically the students use to think what will the teacher do with us? Is it positive or negative in the morning we should use our uniform. If we do not use the uniform, the teacher will give us a punishment. From this we can learn to be a disciplined student. If we go outside the school the teacher will see us used the school uniform, so people will know that we are students from that school. Thanks!
3368	To remind us that we are part of the school, to use the school uniform in the morning to reflect positively on us and from that we can learn to be a good discipline student if we go out of school the teacher will see us in our uniform so people will know that we come from that school. Thank you.
3369	taking away school uniform is a very extreme step because it will make people develop a false sense of security. To me school uniform is a very interesting thing and it reminds me that I am a member of that specific school. If I'm not using the uniform, then teachers will see me as less of a serious student, and that will obviously affect my reputation within that school. I think that some sort of incentive for wearing the uniform, such as an academic ranking system, would help to encourage children to wear it.
3370	Although it is hard to imagine wondering about his father or his life without him, it would be better to have a lousy father than not to have a father at all. If you were to grow up without a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is a lousy one, it helps you strive to be better than him, it could also cause you to start being responsible faster, because the father is not taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is a lousy one but I'm still happy, because I know who he is. Just because I can't imagine wondering about it.
3371	It would be better to have a lousy father than to have no father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy, but I'm still happy that I know who he is. Just because I cannot imagine wondering about it.

Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy I know who he is. Just because I can't imagine wondering about it.
3373	I'm glad my father is only lousy, because I know who he is, and I don't have to go searching for him. And I'm glad I don't have to wonder about who my father is because I don't need to wonder about it. Because I know who he is and I will never have to worry about him.
3374	What would be better about growing up with no father is that you would always have that question of where your father is. If your father is an idiot it helps you to strive to be better than your father. Also, it could cause you to be more responsible since you are aware that there is a really bad parent about. I didn't have a father so I don't know what the worst thing could be like. So in case there is something the worst thing is how I know who my father is.
3375	I think it's better to have a good father than to have a fatherless. And, as long as you have a father, no matter how great or bad he is, at least you have somebody to support your decisions and encouragement.
3376	As long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have someone to support your decisions and encourage you.
3377	For some kids growing up without a father can be hard but as long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody your to support your decisions and encourage you.
3378	Having a lousy father can be hard for some children. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong. As long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody their to support your decisions and encourage you.
3379	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because growing up without a father is hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but even if you have a father even if he is a lousy father, at least you have somebody there to support you and encourage you.
3380	No, having a father is better because it gives a certain security. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girls who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
3381	So I think that both parents in all cases be required to attend even when one parent isn't. If the kids can go to school with both parents who is willing to pay for it, then please attend.
3382	I think it's better to have a lousy father than fatherless, because a father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless than girls without. To me, I see girls who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsibility as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
3383	Girls, who don't have a father, grow up harder lives than girls who do have fathers. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.
3384	Girls should grow up with a good father just as much as boys. To me, I think it's much better to have a lousy father than to have no one. A father just being in the child's life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. Girls who don't have fathers grow up in a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. This shouldn't be the case.
3385	To be able to refute those claims, bottled water needs to be strictly regulated because it's easier to refute those claims when the water is regulated.
3386	No matter what kind of water you drink, tap water is strictly regulated while bottled water is. Therefore, you have no idea what you are drinking when you drink bottled water.
3387	It is strict regulated in tap water, so you know exactly what you are drinking when you drink from a tap.
3388	Tap water is not strictly regulated while bottled water is, so you have no idea what you are drinking when you drink bottled water.
3389	Not strictly regulated and most likely contains toxic chemicals, so it's better to drink tap water instead of drinking bottled water.
3390	If you live in an area where water is not safe, you can have a water purifier. The price for a water purifier is on average $400 to $900, that could be a huge purchase for an individual's household, but for many low-income families, a water purifier can be a necessity. Also, in many countries of the world tap water is not safe and we don't always know what is coming out of the faucet. 
3391	Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills, which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria anyway.

3395	Using 1.5 million barrels of oil is a hard number to calculate, but it makes sense in the context of a country like the US that is a heavy petroleum user. Also, it is supposed to mean that PET bottles waste oil.
3396	One hundred thousand automobiles would be enough to power for a year using 1.5 million barrels of oil.
3397	Over 1.5 million barrels of oil were used to make the plastic bottles that the Americans consumed last year-that doesn't include the petroleum that was used to transport them. That's enough petroleum to power 100,000 automobiles for one year.

3400	According to BBC, in the U.S alone about 10 million gallons of bottled water is transported by air every day. This results in the creation of 2.5 tons of CO2 emissions.
3401	In New York alone, the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. In California, 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006, producing about 2,500 tons of global warming pollution.

3405	If you don't save the bottled water for an emergency you are not thinking about later you are thinking about now. You are drinking bottled water when you don't even need to. Bottle water and tap water is the same thing. Bottled water-has more waste and you have to pay for it. Tap water-has all the same things as bottled except no price and no waste
3406	If you don't save the bottled water for an emergency you are not thinking about saving for a rainy day you are thinking about watering the plants now.

3430	Out of the politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide. Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.
3431	The separation between Church and State means that the government does not can force religious institutions to participate in public life, this rule is dictated by the Supreme Court. Maybe, if the courts allowed gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it does not break the Separation between Church and State.

3435	It is a terrible mistake. I think that people should not be living like that without having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
3436	People who are gay are making a terrible mistake because I think that they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anyone. If it was like that for the normal way of life, would be a whole lot better.

They are making a mistake if they think that one day they will make a commitment to someone they love and who loves them back.
3439	Gay people are making a terrible mistake living right now without committing to anything. If it was that way for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
3440	Do we have the potential?  Yes.  The only competition we have is China, who has done a much better job for the long run.  But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.
3441	Yes. We do. The only competition we have is China, who has done much better in the long run. But then again the way India runs, it always makes order out of chaos.
3442	We have the potential but the way India runs, it always makes order out of chaos.
3443	India is doing a lot better than China because in India, order is always made out of chaos.
3444	That all depends. We have the potential to be the strongest in the world if we set our minds to it. However, we can only be the most influential if we have an orderly and controlled government.
3445	Why do you think we cannot stand that question?  Also you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, one, on, and on
3446	Why do you think it is dangerous to sing that question? Also you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, one and on
3447	Why do you think we can't stand that question? {Also you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, and on
3448	Why do you think we can only stand one answer? Yes you can chose other answers too but we always like our natural religion to be our religion.
3449	Why does you think we cannot stand the question? Also, you forgot all the other choices. Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Shinto, Judaism, and on
3450	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc Atheism: the rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense
3451	Christianity: belief in rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc. Christianity is not a religion. It is a philosophy or ideology. It should be labeled ideology and religion redefined to mean "Passion for a cause."
3452	Christianity rejects rape, genocide, hell fire, unscientific claims, superstition, eternal torture, pedophilia, incest, matricide, infanticide, bestiality, talking donkeys, talking snakes, etc. Atheism the rejection of these claims based on logic, observation, and common sense.
3453	Christianity is not rational, since it is based on myths of the pagan world; atheism is rational, since it makes logical, understandable, and scientific claims.
3454	Christianity believes in unscientific claims such as rape, genocide, talking donkeys, torturing you in hell fire, animism and incest as well as myths such as eternal life. Atheism rejects these claims on logic, common sense and research
3455	The idea of God is false. Both sides contradict each other's belief and no one truthfully wins. I support Christianity because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
3456	Oh my friend... I support Christianism because of my "faith to God" and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around. Oh maybe you do have a faith in God, but not a real faith to God... it's the belief and personal feeling for something they want us to believe, and I don't have to defend it because it's just a belief. I have many beliefs and not to many concrete facts or reasons that really speak about it. Besides, there are some people that believe in everything and as they say "You have to believe in life after this world and in God after you die." I wouldn't call them believers.] Here is some text: {Oh my god you posted at 4:00 am could you please say something that doesn't suck and i will vote for it if so read this: Original comment
3457	When people say God doesn't exist, I don't actually have to deal with them. Whatever you think is your faith. That's your own belief, and I don't have to deal with that because that's my belief. Mainly I support Christianity because I have faith to God and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
3458	Whoever points out the existence of God to someone else is called a religious person and he doesn't need any proof of God's existence. The idea of God is false is your own words and I don't have to deal with this if I don't believe in God. Both sides contradict each others beliefs and no one can win by being truthful. This is a fight between two armies, and no one can win until the end. Mainly, I support Christianity because of my faith to God and your proof that God doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around.
3459	After reading this maybe you will be a proponent of Christianity because of your faith and not because of any proof. From the link provided, it seems that there are no proper proofs for anything about God. I'm not saying you have to be a Christian, I just want you to understand that there is nothing we have to deal with and I do not need to do this because it's none of my business if you believe in God.
3460	Back in my day, people who walked out their doors would've faced violence. Now, people walk out their doors facing violence by Bill Gates through Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
3461	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church, and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
3462	My dad is a Baptist and my mom is a Holocaust denier. Now, I believe in God, not religion.
3463	In my opinion a man has no right to harass a woman just because he is attracted to her, or she is attractive to him. The man may decide he is attracted to the girl and he may decide she is attractive to him, or both. Yet the unwanted relationship exists and they are hurting innocent children. Hate crimes has nothing to do with God and nothing to do with love. We should allow men and women the right to love each other without harming innocent children.

Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholes believe in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
3465	I am a Christian because I believe that there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth.
3466	I'm a Christian because I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done on earth.
3467	 I am a Christian for I believe that there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth.
3468	I am a Christian because I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth.
3469	I believe there is a just God who will do ultimate justice for the good and bad deeds done here on earth. There isn't a God that exists in modern science. We're just as justified as other believing people.
3470	I'm not a Christianity. When I see Christians fighting over who can tell the most holy and true story, I am astonished. Sometimes it is hard to believe we are all brothers and sisters and that the end result of our argument will be that we will be killed like the Jews.
3471	You shouldn't use the arguments that are used by Christians and even Street fighting. You won't be able to argue with them unless you use the same arguments.
3472	I'm not a Christian but I do have to say that the beliefs that Christ was a prophet are in reality completely false. For example, if I want to argue that playing cards are wrong for gambling, then I'm going to have to argue against the beliefs of everyone who claims Christ was a prophet. That's simply too much for the average person to hope to do. So, I agree with the idea of Christianity, but I also have
3473	Actually, the purpose of Christianity is to teach us to be merciful and to show ourselves to be as holy as we can be. If we argue with them about the same topic, it means we are not allowing them to teach us. That is a form of hypocrisy, and therefore it is not polite to argue with them.
3474	If you're a Christian, you really can't argue with them unless your argument is based on the same subject. Like Street fighting and UFC. Different platforms.
3475	If God doesn't exist, how come there are loads of predictions, sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus?
3476	If God doesn't exist how come there are plenty of scriptures written thousands of years before Jesus that have prophesied exactly what happened to him?
3477	If God doesn't exist how come there are loads of prophecies, written thousands of years before Jesus, saying exactly what happened to Jesus?
3478	If God doesn't exist how come there are loads of predictions, that were sent by God, written thousands of years before Jesus saying exactly what happened to Jesus.
3479	If God does not exist then there are many predictions, sent by God and written thousands of years before Jesus about what Jesus has to do, say or do in the world.
3480	It must not be compulsory, but as a requirement rather than a regular course at school. How would you consider PE if the child isn't so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
3481	PE should not be mandatory, but at least they should be required, but not to a greater degree. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
3482	It's not mandatory but it should be required. Children who are not healthy should be less required of PE. Boys should have different physical education activities than girls.
3483	PE should be a requirement, but it should not be too often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
3484	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible, separate boys from girls. For boys, assign some good physical education activities to them, the same thing for girls, give them games for girls ideas.
3485	If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. Plus what will you do when you kids are gay?
3486	Honestly who cares. If people really want to be together so be it. It doesn't mean it is authentic love. If you don't like what they do don't be their friend. Plus what will you do when your kids are gay?
3487	As long as you are free to love who you want and it doesn't harm others you should be fine.
3488	If people really wanna be together then no one is stopping them. It's not like marriage is some high holy thing, we sell it on TV, drive throughs, etc. And that's fake love. If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend and if you have kids, you are responsible for the choices your kids make. Plus, what will you do when you kids are gay?
3489	It shouldn't matter if people want to be together, so long as it is honest and mutually enjoyed. Even if they are cheating, so long as they are discreet and do it legally, it is not wrong. If you think someone should have to be married for decades to count as a meaningful relationship, then you should actively disapprove. If you don't like what their do, don't be their friend. Plus what will you do when your kids are gay?
3490	Right wing/conservative groups? Those three are from the ones that voted for Breivik, who was one of the most right wing people that I have ever heard of. They are also extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that. Those three are #2, #3, and #5 on your list. #2 is a polling company, if I recall, and they are also extremely biased. It would be good if we could limit it to two weeks and really help people to understand this, but I don't think we can do that. It would be good if we could edit it more and have a little more quality control. Anyway, we can easily handle it with these two bits.
3491	To be honest, the # of people from 'right' wing/conservative groups should be more than the # on your list. That is not to say they are not intelligent or have intelligent arguments, that there are some people in the 'centre' who can see a problem, if you let it be as it is. But if you give it the head scratching it deserves, your children, your wifes who are bi-sexual or lesbian or gay, or if you have changed your mind and some one comes up to you to change yours, not only will you not hear it. You won't be able to shut your mouth.
3492	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups. Especially on gay marriage. They are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that. Those three are #2,#3, and #5 on your list. #2 is a polling company, if I recall and #1 has no real barring on the argument at hand.
3493	Two of your links are from right-wing conservative groups. Especially against gay marriage. They are extremely biased. I did not even have to go to the sites to know that. #2 is a polling company, if I recall and 'try' to write intelligently, but don't have research behind their writings.#1 has no real barring on the argument at hand.
3494	Three of your links are from right wing/conservative groups. Especially with gay marriage. They are extremely biased and I didn't even have to go to the sites to know that. # 2 is a polling company if I recall and try to write intelligently but don't have research behind their writings. # 1 is a complete lack of evidence to back up what they say.
3495	There is a loving God, and that God is against gay marriage, along with other laws. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.
3496	There's a loving God, eh?
3497	Absolutely loving and loving God.
3498	There is a loving god, right?
3499	The evil is always in those who are religious and lean to their religious beliefs in order to accomplish evil goals. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.
3500	Opinion does not matter. It doesn't matter what people think of gay marriage. Whether or not it's appropriate or not. Your feelings are valid and should be expressed if you're gay.
3501	I think all people should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love however, a woman cannot express her feelings as a gay sexuality to a man. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like, when they like!
3502	There is a disagreement on whether gay marriage is allowed. I would say that most of the population of Britain would say that it is wrong. However, I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to their lover so I would say that it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to someone else who isn't what we are, however, a man can express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman can express their feelings to a woman, so I think that gays should be allowed to do what they want when they like!
3503	If we had a gay rights society we would not have homosexual identity. We would all have the same opportunities.
3504	In my opinion I think people should be allowed to express their feelings to whoever they love as long as they do not go against any other person's rights. Therefore gay marriage should be accepted because how come you can get married to a man sexually while a woman cannot? Likewise a woman should be able to express to a man she is interested and how she feels about him. I think this is not bad in my opinion because it does not matter what you are in this world you can only be a born homosexual or an extravert or a likle so it doesn't matter what you are because what you do in your sexuality is just who you are not what kind of person you are and that is what makes this argument so unfair on me in my opinion.
3505	In general I believe that following your own personal pursuit is better than helping others, because it's natural to follow your own interest and not try to help someone else when you want to follow your personal pursuits. Although I believe it is nice to help someone with things that are within your ability.
3506	It depends on what your trying to accomplish. If your helping yourself, it is better to be able to do it to help others. If you want to have money and do some good in the world, then you should be working to contribute to people who cannot help themselves.
3507	Personal pursuit is better because I think helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back to you, even if you're helping others. This because you do not want your life to be out of whack helping others.
3508	Although helping others is beneficial in most ways, it is still better to help yourself. Anything done to oneself has a much better return, even if it is done for others.
3509	Helping yourself before others is natural. No matter what you do, everything comes back to you. Even if you are helping others. Because you don't want your life to be out of whack helping others.
3510	You should help your family member when he needs it. You should not help a random person who doesn't even know you when you can help the person who is related to you.
3511	If it comes from your family, no problem, you help them out. If not, you help out a family member you know. It is our nature to help people. I think you're right that helping someone in your family is more important than helping anyone else.
3512	Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again, I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something, you're going to do anything to help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're family. If someone who is unrelated to you is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
3513	Personal pursuit is better than other people's pursuit. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
3514	To the person who said that personal pursuits comes first before anything else, I disagree because if someone in your family is in need of something, then you are helping them regardless what. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you are helping the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
3515	No single reason can justify physical and mental abuse. As long as it's been abusive to you, I do not recommend you staying there. It is your homelife that is the problem, and it's sad to see that young women are forced to live in a home that is abusive. If you think that you're safe with your dad, the SPD will decide for you.
3516	You should have a very good reason for your physical and mental abuse.  If you could get a job in walking distance, and you put up with abuse until you were old enough to leave home, you still recommend staying at home as long as you can.  You would not want to leave your homelife as a child if you have been physically and mentally abused.  You don't say anything about your homelife.  You have to have a very good reason for it.  You would not want to leave your homelife as a child if you have been physically and mentally abused.  You should only leave your homelife when you are an adult, with very good and reasoned reasons.
3517	You don't say anything about your home life. You have to have a very good reason for leaving home. If you could get a job within walking distance, they consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home. And I still recommend staying at home as long as you can. If it is your home life that's the problem, get Social Services involved.
3518	You don't say anything about your home life, you have to have a very good reason for it, if you could get a job within walking distance, then they would consider that reasonable. I put up with a lot of physical and mental abuse until I was old enough to leave home. I still recommend staying at home if you can. If it is your home life that's the problem, get social services involved.
3519	How does none of the legislative mandates violate your right to join an association that claims to have an unambiguous purpose? Or is this not even about the purpose of an association? Wouldn't a purpose that is vague and unclear but that meets some illegal criteria (say, carrying a weapon, or someone who is responsible for the lives of others) be a legitimate purpose in a penal code?
3520	It probably would be better to do it before she moved or right away.
3521	Since he knew about it and petitioned the court at that time, let a lot of time go past, the court will view this most likely as allowing it. But he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. Lots better chance had it done it prior to her moving or as soon as she moved.
3522	With all the severe problems that haunting Pakistan, he knew about it, but didn't petition the court at that time let a lot of time go past, the court will most likely view this as allowing it. But he will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. Most definitely there is a much better chance if it was done in the past or as soon as she moved.
3523	Sabbatical has many downsides. It is expensive. It does not change your tenure status. The state may not return it for a year. The case may not have much interest. He will have to petition the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state. It will be at the discretion of the court to find her in contempt.
3524	The killer should have petitioned the court to find her in contempt, and order her to return to the state as soon as possible. There would have been a better chance it had been done as soon as she moved here.
3525	The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways" people not only have a right to say pretty much what they want, other people have a right to object, argue and even ask for an apology. a liberal says something, a conservative objects, and the conservative is bashed for "violating a person's freedom of speech". a conservative says something, a liberal objects, and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit. So who is really against freedom of speech; the conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact you're offended by a statement.
3526	The deal is as follows, or the can be as: "Freedom of speech goes both ways."  People have a right to say pretty much what they want and other people have a right to object, argue and even ask for an apology.   A liberal says something and a conservative objects and the conservative is bashed for "violating the freedom of speech."   A conservative says something and a liberal objects, and either conservatives let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit.  So who is really against freedom of speech?  The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement or the liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement?
3527	The deal is FREEDOM of speech goes both ways,  There is a right not only to say pretty much what you want, other people have a right to object, argue and even ask for an apology.  A liberal says something, conservative object and the conservative is bashed for "violating a person's freedom of speech."  A conservative says something, a liberal objects and conservatives either let it drop there or defend the original statement on its merit.  So who is really against freedom of speech;  The conservative who asks a liberal for an apology for an offensive statement, or the liberal who acts like you are not allowed to express the fact you offend when a person says something.
3528	The deal is: "Freedom of speech goes both ways". There are no doubt some bad people that express some offense, but the point of free speech is to express whatever you like. So it goes both ways. For example, a liberal may say some offensive things and a conservative say to him/ her that they are free to say what they want, and no matter what the statements are, a liberal can say these things. There is nothing wrong with that. I believe that a liberal has a right to say whatever they want, and a conservative is also allowed to say whatever they want. So no one should be censured for what they say.
3529	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
3530	There is much controversy in our country about the legality of abortion.  I believe that since it's the woman's responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.
3531	Americans as a whole think that this way. There is much controversy in our country about this issue. It is currently legal in most states to have an abortion, but religious zealots are always trying to change the law. Obviously I am pro-women's rights (not pro abortion and not pro-life, but believe that since it's her responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.)
3532	Americans do not like this type of issue because it is controversial, and it is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law, obviously, I'm pro-women's rights but do not agree with abortion and am for life
3533	Americans as a whole do not agree with this.  There is much controversy in our country about this issue.  It is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion, but conservative religious zealots are always trying to change the law.  Obviously, I am a proponent of women's rights (not the abortion and not pro-life, but believe that since it's the woman's responsibility it ultimately needs to be her choice.)
3534	Americans as a whole do not think like this.  There is much controversy in our country about this issue.  It is currently legal in most (I believe) states to have an abortion, but religious zealots are always trying to change the law.  Obviously, I am in favor of women's rights (not against abortion and not against them, but I believe that since it is the woman's responsibility, it ultimately needs to be her choice.)
3535	There are multiple other alternatives to capital punishment which is only effective if the society is comfortable with it. On the other hand, it is immoral for a man to take another man's life no matter what the situation. Despite its effectiveness, there are other alternatives to it.
3536	Capital punishment is effective, but only when it is used in a country that is comfortable with it. Its barbarian to take another's life, regardless of the circumstance, and there are better, though not as effective, alternatives.
3537	From my perspective, capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find their crime rates are much lower than in the United States. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it. On the other hand, it's immoral for a man to take another's life, no matter what the situation, since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice. Its simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical Christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to the christian countries, its effective but at the same time, it is barbaric, immoral, and there are better, but not as effective, solutions.
3538	Capital punishment is a good and effective alternative to dealing with the worst of the criminals, however the perspective of a biased person goes against it. It is a barbaric, immoral, and inefficient alternative, but the other alternatives should be more than adequate.
3539	Capital punishment is just one method of law enforcement. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than in the US. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it. On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life and no matter what the situation, since you're assuming a position of superiority, there are better alternatives. Despite its effectiveness, there are other alternatives to it that should not be a first choice.
3540	You can move the complaint to a small claim court, get the complaint dismissed, or get your attorney to represent you and advise you if you think you have a chance.
3541	When you dismiss a lawsuit, it doesn't automatically mean that you will lose it. So, under the circumstances, you have grounds for a counter-attack. If the company continues to pursue this claim, you can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. Also include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that they be corrected. Separately, notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand that a change be made. In this manner you protect your interests - and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
3542	At this point there is no dismissal, only relief from further liability that can be taken in an action such as a lawsuit. You can file a formal letter to the company requesting that these negative remarks be deleted from any reports, and even demand that the company correct any other derogatory material. You can also add a statement that you will take legal action if the company continues to harass you for this matter.
3543	It leaves open the possibility of filing a new lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the debt.   "Without prejudice" means that the case has not been adjudicated and no resolution has been made.  However, if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies, you have grounds for a counter-action.  You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action.  You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected.  Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change.  In this manner you protect your interests - and, if the company is fool enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make a wad.
3544	If the dismissal does in fact leave open the possibility of retrial or taking other action to collect the claim, then the company should make arrangements for a formal counter action, demanding removal of inaccurate information and demanding corrections to the reports. You should also write a formal letter to the company stating that they know of the incurred interest, and requesting that interest be eliminated. Separately, you should inform the agencies that the incorrect report has been entered, and request that their information be immediately corrected.
3545	To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared capital punishment to abortion:  The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent. Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from ever happening. But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row. But concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.

3547	Yeah it's good that there has been a lot of talks about capital punishment and capital punishment is a horrible act. I don't think making a fetus harm a child is a horrible act, but I also don't think cappital punishment is a good solution to this problem.

And concerning abortion, there are now several insurance plans that allow the women to undergo an abortion and if they happen to discover later that the baby is born alive, they could even be covered by their insurance. So from the baby's perspective, they have a just reason to not want to be born alive, right?
3550	I think it is irresponsible to let children be near any pool.  Like I said, to me it wouldnt be worth the risk of losing your home, your car, your earnings...But, you are absolutely liable if you dont have a fence around your pool...Your insurance company would like to hear what the neighbors told you, though.
3551	If you don't put a fence around your pool, and a little child sneaks in and drowns, you would be completely liable, and would likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit.  To me, the risk is not worth the reward, I'd install it no matter what the law is (but yes, I think every pool in Ohio requires one).  Also, if you don't have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.
3552	If you don't put a fence around the pool, and a little child sneaks in and drowns, you would be completely liable and would lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit. So to me, the risk is not worth the reward. I would install it no matter what the law is. Also, if you don't have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue.
3553	It should be legally required for every pool in Ohio to have a fence around it. You can't just assume the risk. A person could drown by simply sneaking into a pool and you would be put at risk. The risk should be worth the reward. If you don't install one the insurance company might exclude you from your homeowners policy.
3554	Yes, I think that if people were going around taking risks like this at pools that they wouldn't want anyone to take risks in their homes. So that is why we should put a fence around pools to prevent people from drowning their kids while they are out in the pool.
3555	Yes, it is illegal to exclude white men.  In many ways, they are not protected and therefore left unprotected from being discriminated against.  In fact, as it is pretty clear that this is a discriminatory issue, I think that it is important to remember how often in America they need protection.
3556	Color, age, or sex discrimination is illegal. Nevertheless, they are not protected from discrimination! It seems kinda funny, but how often in America do they need protection...?
3557	In America, white men are the only group that is not covered in a protected class. That seems funny but how often in America do they need protection?
3558	This question is actually a great example of discrimination.  The law states that you cannot discriminate by sex, color, or age, but white men are excluded from a protected class.  So technically, yes it is illegal to exclude them, but they are not protected.  Seems kinda funny, but how often in America do they need protection...?
3559	The law is not very clear on this.  Some states exempt all employees.  It seems like the law just protects a certain group of people.  Well, they are included in a protected class but not the other group.  So, technically yes it is illegal to exclude them.  It is not clear in the law but they are protected. 
3560	But technically IC systems are liable for your fraud, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.  My advice to you is to change your bank account number immediately so they can't dip into it anytime they like.  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, tell them that you are reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay it down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
3561	Typically IC Systems would have to pay small claims court for a lawsuit.  My advice is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like (this is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers once you have given your permission for the withdrawal).  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying.  If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
3562	Actually, you would probably have to go to small claims court.  My advice to you is to change your bank account number right away so they can't dip into it any time they like.  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them and then pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  Then stop paying them. If they continue to come after you, refer to the letter and point out that you have a legitimate dispute.
3563	When you set up payment arrangements, you'll need to tell your bank that you won't be receiving their checks.  Also, you'll need to stop receiving their ACH transfers and tell them you'll only receive their checks when the letter I'm writing to them will be in their hands.
3564	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.

3565	We already have this, it is called the Social Security Card.  Every employer can call the SSA and verify the information of a given social security number.  Our government has just made it so difficult to do this that most employers will not take the time.  When you are hired for a job, you are supposed to provide I-9 documentation.  You can use a passport, or state issued id & social security card (not just number), or birth certificate & ss card, etc.  There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers.  The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have.  Politicians are becoming better and better at doing nothing but creating redundent worthless laws.  And we keep re-electing them.  So I would NOT vote for this ridiculous limit on my freedom and waste of the American taxpayers' monies.
3566	Spasiba kee na kha ng since lets start studying god meaning and so on. First law to go is it is a PAYEE'S state which means every citizen in this state PAYES ALL money. If you have not been taxed for two years then they are going to issue your I-94 to show you've already been taxed in the past. Let's not discuss on how I got ahold of the phone number, please do so your life would become way easier.  Remember as we talk we also speaking to DOWNLOAD id here to start using the social security card when you finish your course of study or now just here. There are already laws enacted but we let them on the Senate cause it brings more flak if they follow rules rather than get away with rules.

3568	There is no problem with SS Card of issuing the. What there is an issue that only SSN as an employee ID can verify if the information provided by an employee is accurate and not fraud. So if your employer asks you to verify social security number, then the government can verify if you are the owner of that account. And the current issue is that, we government can't verify the identity of the individuals who are completing a transaction, due to lack of law and bureaucracy. So for the government to verify your identity, they have to ask you to provide multiple identification documentations. I feel that it is an unnecessary expense to an employer.

3570	Nothing is known about the Indian who wrote the first book on Shakespeare, but some speculate that it was his native son, a British Catholic with a passion for Shakespeare and dramatic rhetoric. The only historian who knew Shakespeare was French, a Jewish convert.  {The document says that the students will learn and study Shakespeare's texts. However, the document does not explain the purpose of this. Students study Shakespeare's works as a way to develop literacy skills? For teaching Shakespeare's influence on literature? Are the author(s) trying to link Shakespeare's legacy to an Indian English-language tradition? How would a legal restriction on the use of this book help to fulfill the stated goal of the book?   However, I'm wondering about how a government could prevent any books from being used to meet the stated goals of the Book. What types of action could a government take to prevent this particular book? How would a restriction on the use of this book be consistent with the goals for teaching Shakespeare and Shakespeare's influence on literature?   A discussion of this book's restriction could (and perhaps should) take place. However, I think it would be an irresponsible, oppressive, and false move to restrict the use of one particular book for political reasons. Many books have major political or religious messages which are sometimes expressed in ways that are considered offensive or even controversial.  Given this discussion, it is important to note the difference between what kind of book we are discussing and something else. Books that express political views are not illegal; instead, they may be regulated or prohibited by legislation or legislative regulations.  Likewise, there are books that contain scary stories that could be viewed as problematic by some people; however, the books are not illegal since they are regulated through legislation.  However, what happens when someone wants to print and distribute a book that advocates
3571	Good luck. A law named after a person is questionable since those pusing it will often be reacting based on emotion and grief rather than reason. It should be pointed out that any good law will have safeguards and rational provisions.
3572	The voting process has become an emotional one. People, whether voters or legislators, pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. Saving the lives of many people from unlawful death is the principle, and shouldn't be based purely on emotion or political calculation. But the system obviously is such that isn't possible. Good luck.
3573	While any law named after a person may be questionable, there should be safeguards in place so that if something turns out to be illegal, it was really the action that was the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation. Furthermore, the voting process has become an emotional one and logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines. Even wise men can get emotionally involved and make decisions that they later regret. Luckily, I'm not old enough to be the target of a petition.
3574	If a law has to be named after someone, why not the laws for the insane so they don't just vandalize things?  Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.  And sadly, that's not likely to change any time soon. Good luck.
3575	Absolutely not. Freedom of speech will come back into existence at a later stage.
3576	No, absolutely not. That's when we need those freedoms the most. We need to be able to say, "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prison. I may not agree with someone else's opinions, but I'll fight to the death to make sure they can state their opinions.
3577	Nobody needs to be jailed for saying what he thinks.
3578	Admitting you might not agree with someone else's opinion is more important than protecting your freedom to say that. We need to be able to say "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prision.  We need to fight to the death for our freedoms.
3579	Absolutely. That's when we need those freedoms the most. We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prison.

3580	by standing back.  In the public eyes, Iraq does not deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorists for the people of the world. Don't forget terrorists rule it. And we are not dictators, we are freedom fighters who fight for freedom, justice and liberty. Unfortunitly, people lost sight of it, and voted wrong yesterday. And morally we are now also headed in the wrong direction. People need to be responible for their action and not blame it on science or the society. Finally for the budget, there goes the state and national level budget and economy and our taxes. People what things are in place for a better country and community. Who do you think we pay for it in the long run. We do with our taxes, not with the so called federal and state money people think we have. Country is in a mess thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our free things work.  and by standing back., we got our freedom by standing back. 
3581	That is how we got our freedom. We stood back in the public eye and Iraq doesn't deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting terrorists from the terrorists who rule it. And we're not dictators, we are freedom fighters. Fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE and LIBERTY. Unfortunately people lost sight of that and voted wrong yesterday. We need to be responsible for our action and not blame it on science or the society. When it comes to the budget it goes to the state and national level budget, the taxes, the economy. People need to think things in place for a better country and community. But who do you think pays for it in the long run?

3582	free and private education is the reason why we are more free and more responsible.
3583	How do you think we got our freedom by standing back. In the public eyes, Iraq doesn't deserve freedom like ours. We need to keep fighting the terrorist for the people of the world from the terrorist who rule it. And we are not dictators. We are freedom fighters who fight for FREEDOM, JUSTICE AND LIBERTY.

We pay for our taxes, not with the so called federal and state money people think we have. Country is in a mess thanks to the ungrateful American public who forget how our free lives were supposed to be and now are devolving to chaos.
3584	How did we get our freedom.  There was no freedom until that huge revolution in the United States of America and the people of the United States fought to protect and preserve their freedom against the British imperialistic rule.  Iraqi people are not free because they still face terrorist rule and the evil of the United States. Freedom is not available for them due to the power and control of the United States.
3585	Law is an obligation for society and to which people should abide. Any law that doesn't respect the rights of human beings is not morally right. However, your right shouldn't hinder the feelings of other people. Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught, however, people tend to bend laws and break laws, to which the penalty is not severe. Such as speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. A law would be right if it doesn't invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person. If you are unhappy with any law, you can fight it in the court of justice or ask your legislature to change it. However, thats a very tiring and exhaustive process.

3590	i totally agree with you, for the same reasons. my animals suffer every year as they seem to go off weeks before now. even the main displays are starting earlier. The first big display i know of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October! What happened to November 5th! if it was one night only it wouldn't be so bad.  i cant sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. They are terrified!  even though the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol.  they are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. It should be illegal to sell them in shops. Organised displays should be set for the one night only so us animal lovers can help our pets by sedation.  you are so right on this subject too. 
3591	What you said is totally true. My animals are terrified now, as they seem to go off weeks before now. Even the main display, which is usually held in October, has started in the middle of October. What happened to November 5th? If it were one night only, it wouldn't be so bad. I cannot sedate my animals. They are terrified. Even the display, organised for the one night only, would be useful so I can help my pets. You are totally right. 
3592	There should be no argument in this really whatever way yu see a fetus it's still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way you shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you and if you didn't wannna get pregnant in the first place don't have sex or use protection. I see the issue that there there are some women that get raped, and it's very unfortunate but I think they should give the child up for adoption in such cases. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life? You are so right on this subject too.
3593	There are numerous discussions about the subject. The first big display i know of was a few weeks ago in the middle of October! The one night only is ok if it was one night only. I can't sedate my animals because it goes on for weeks. They are terrified!. Even though the sale of fireworks is illegal to kids, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. They are dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. The sale of fireworks should be illegal to kids. Organised displays for the one night only should be set up to save our pets from the pain and threats of people buying fireworks. You are right on this subject
3594	I totally agree with you, because I know it's getting harder and harder to sedate my animals. They're terrified. Even though sale of fireworks is illegal to children, they still get them just as they do cigarettes and alcohol. They're dangerous and just another tool for those intent to be a menace to the public. I also think it's ideal that the organised displays should be set for the one night only, so we animal lovers can help our pets by sedation.
3595	Thanks for bringing up this important issue. Most of the things you mentioned have beneficial uses, but also can be used for evil. I think the Bush administration has demonstrated how our rights can be undermined. They are talking of retaining prisoners in Cuba for the rest of their lives, without charges or benefit of legal defense. The only way to protect our rights is to participate in the process of government. I hope everyone who reads this is ready to defend liberty with their vote on the 7th.

3600	If 1/2 the schools in the US thinks yes, then the history of the country will not be well taught. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I would expect the Civil War to be taught before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, Freedom of Press, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not new Great Britain or some British-controlled country paying taxes on land we are not living on.
3601	If half the schools in the U.S thinks yes, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and Bill of Rights. At least, I would expect the Civil War to be mentioned before 6th grade, the rest would follow. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not a new Great Britain or some British ruled country paying taxes on land we are not living and harvesting from. ha, nowadays, this country is doing all kinds of illegal activities. No wonder why half the youth is lost and confused.
3602	If you think the teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education, then they should study up a little better. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and Bill of Rights. At least I would expect them to teach the Civil War before 6th grade. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not like the new great Britain. No wonder 1/2 the youth are lost and confused.
3603	If 1/2 the schools in the USA thinks yes, and they have reached this point, then teachers are not doing well in the history aspect of education. Now, these kids need to know their rights, and the rights of others. I thought schools get taught the Constitution and bill of rights. At least I would expect a history of America with the civil war before 6th grade and the rest of the country would follow. Freedom of speech, FREEDOM OF PRESS, freedom of religion, and so on. With this knowledge one can understand why America is America and not a UK or a BC followed country paying taxes on land we are not living or harvesting from.
3604	For such boys and girls, the only thing that will teach them right and wrong is their parents and teacher.
3605	In court, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he/she is older than 12 years old.  I also believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his/her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges....
3606	Illegal medication is a crime and you should be notified if your child is taking illegal medications.  I also believe that if a juvenile is so mentally ill, the state is legally obligated to inform you of any new charges or pending charges.  However, if a child is released by the juvenile court, then the court will assume you know what is going on...
3607	If you are referring to ethics laws, you should be notified of any medications the child takes as the state does not need to notify you of any new charges or pending charges. You should be notified of the charges if you are the guardian of the juvenile and this will be part of the same visitation of the juvenile. If there is any pending charge, you should be notified of the charges.  As for the state not having to notify you of charges, if the juvenile is under 12 and not physically adjudicated for a crime, you should not be notified of any charges by the state.
3608	If we are speaking in the realm of ethics and informed consent, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he/she is older than 12. I also believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his/her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges.

Legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he/she is older than 12.  I also believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his/her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges....
3610	I've never been a waitress or a server but, I feel that regardless of how much in tips they make, they should get minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else. As for the tips, they have to earn them. Just think of a slow night and little or no tips, who walks away with what? 20 bucks for working 8 hours on her feet. I think there should be a change in this, everyone should get nothing less than minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3611	In service and waitress, I think regardless of how much in tips they make, they should get minimum wage. They work as hard as anyone else. As for the tips, they have to earn them.

3612	I don't think a minimum wage should be extended beyond services. Despite the fact that people make a good living, I think they should not get paid that much just because they work as hard as anyone. Also, I'm not saying they shouldn't have a fair share of the tips. Just think of a slow night and little or no tips she walks away with what 20 bucks for working eight hours on her feet. I think there should be a change in this, everyone should get nothing less than minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3613	When it comes to wages, I think that employees should be paid the minimum wage regardless of their occupation. It works the same way whether you are a server or waitress, you are still delivering the same service to the customer. Think of the total hours worked for the tips and you walk away with less than 20 bucks.
3614	I've never been a server or waitress. But, I feel that regardless of how much they make tips, they should get minimum wage. They work just as hard as anyone else.

I think there should be a change in this, everyone should get nothing less than minimum wage regardless of their occupation.
3615	If a person WANTS to say the Pledge before a meeting, game, or class then they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing another person to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain.   It really p*sses me off when people try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country?? I would think that would trump anything else.
3616	It pisses me off that people try to claim that just "hearing" the pledge violates their rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country? I would think that would trump anything else.
3617	Allegiance is something that you owe to yourself, not to someone else. You can't assert allegiance to your country if you don't live there.
3618	It does piss me off when people try to claim that just "reading" the pledge violates your rights. Well, what about my right to assert myself and my allegiance to my country?? I would think that would trump anything else.
3619	agree with you. If a person WANTS to say the Pledge before a meeting (game, class, etc), then they should be allowed to do so. No one is forcing other people to join in and pledge -- they are perfectly within their rights to abstain. I would think that would trump anything else.
3620	Firstly, it's a very short term decision, that can be dearly regretted if you live long enough. Life can be given, and should not be sold.
3621	NO!! Firstly, because this essentially puts a price on human life and dignity. Life can be given, it should not be sold. Secondly, because it's usually a short term decision, that can be dearly regretted if you live long enough. You will of course sell only organs you can live without, a kidney or an eye... but what if, later in life, your remaining one fails, and you don't have the money to replace it? You're in the doo doo, possibly dead if it was a kidney.

3626	You don't even know what logic means. If he was studying hard he would be able to talk about logic well and if he was not studying hard he would not know what logic is.
3627	You're taking a test to show what you have learned.  Obviously he didn't learn anything!  That would be like getting surgery on your heart and after the doctor says, "oh you wanted it done correctly? Well, you didn't say that".  Tell him to take the energy he's scheming with to study!
3628	It is a given that nobody else takes the test and is sure of their skills. I think he is only acting this way because he wants to have an advantage over his classmates. Thus I think that he should study hard instead of plotting how to cheat
3629	Don't use sarcasm with teenagers. I don't think he's being sarcastic.  It's a given. You're taking a test to show what you've learned.  Obviously he hasn't learned anything.

3630	If daughter was 19, and competent at the time, then all records are hers, nobody elses'. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders documents. You need a lawyer involved.
3631	It depends on how much time has passed, the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents. If they are the henholders documents, then they can be charged with theft, if they have changed the record herself. A lawyer can do this and make a good decision for her. 
3632	If she was 19 and competent at the time, then all records are hers, nobody else's. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft.

3633	If daughter is not 19 years old and competent, at the time of the deed, then only the daughter's legal guardians can be charged with theft of documents.

3635	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people. There are some that are extremely hard to convince because they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own home. That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the many concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
3636	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many, but there are some people that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That is for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
3637	It has been proven that many people are not convinced about this argument. They don't want to believe the government could murder 3,000 of it's own citizens. That's for the lucky ones. For the unlucky the situation will be worse. They will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country. They will be imprisoned in their own house.
3638	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, and that many have had their beliefs change, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, especially if they are somewhat religious. These reasons are faith based, which means they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They are all going to wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house, with the lucky ones living in close proximity to the terrorists in their towers.
3639	There is also evidence of the wiped-out, mass murder that goes on in Iraq and Afghanistan. The American public is not sophisticated enough to comprehend why we need thousands more of our citizens dying to keep in a war that is unconstitutional and immoral.
3640	If you look closely at the basic strengths of a public opinion poll, you'll see that only one of them is practically applicable to ethics.  The shortcoming of any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency for bias at every stage of the questioning; an ethical poll taker should always minimize bias.  The next most important shortcoming is that if sample and questionnaire are not suited to represent the entire population, small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.  If you'd like to see the rest of my comments: https://publicopinion.lib.utexas.edu/epi/2014/05/polsl-ep-ethical-police/fullpapers/s452.html>
3641	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process. The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has a bias as well. The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do. The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll. In short, polls will never be 100% helpful until they are designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention whatsoever. But what's the fun in that?
3642	Unfortunately bias is involved in all public opinion surveys and results are skewed away from truth when polling groups are biased in any direction. These include the survey taker, people writing the questions, people who are polled, and people who are working on the administration of the survey.  Common examples of unethical survey takers include uneducated, politically motivated, and/or wealthy; common examples of biased poll writers include intelligence agencies; common examples of biased poll respondents include people who are suspicious of the democracy and trust in government; common examples of biased poll administrators include the official executive within the poll agency.  Most people would be surprised to know that many government elections are actually rigged and defacto dictatorships may be honored as democracies. If a poll is going to be conducted unethically then the results will never be trustworthy and unbelievable.
3643	The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.

The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do. The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both. Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll. In short, polls will never be 100 percent helpful until they are designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention whatsoever. But what’s the fun in that?
3644	The main shortcoming of any public opinion poll is that it is biased at every stage of its implementation.  The person asking the question has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question also has a bias.  The main shortcoming in any poll is that it is biased at every stage of the implementation.
3645	My hope when I die is that my children and children of my children are positively affected throughout their lives by the values I have taught and the examples I have provided.

3650	It's biased because of corporate control by the Bush Administration.  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.  It's a crime to threaten the President.  But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards.  But I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
3651	We are down, due to Internet censorship, because the old brainfuck trolls (like FF and WI) didn't want this country to get the news.  In their stupid head, the United States was dominated by a loose group of poor conservatives, who were not popular with the news media.  So they gave Internet censorship to a Bush brosided Internet-company.  I am amazed that anyone would doubt the assertions of the grassroots military supporters of the Bush regime!  And they also have some horribly mean spying programs so they will have a lot to say about us.
3652	Yeah, it is biased. But what do you expect from a corporation that will readily hand over personal Internet subject search records of Americans to Bush and Co. in the administration's guise of cracking down on porn?  From what I heard, they also use people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers that push the Republican agenda.  And it was dumb to ask that question. It is a crime to threaten the president and even though you weren't trying to do that, it can be interpreted that way--especially by this president. But I've noticed that they've let a lot of your other questions slide by which violates their vulgarity standards, but I guess as long as you're not offensive in a political way, then are fine with it.  I'm sure most conservatives are like that.
3653	Yahoo! is not as biased as you say.  It's more Republican than the Bush administration.  I heard they also used people to fill Yahoo Answers with questioners and answerers.

3655	Have you been standing out in the free cheese line in the hot sun for too long?  Hey, believe it or not, the rich people DO pay lots of other people's taxes for them! But it is the middle class who gets the short end of the stick. The rest of your ramblings sound rather socialistic.  Are you insinuating liberals are emulating socialists? I never, in a million years, would have thought THAT (pause for heavy sarcastic sigh).

3660	Here is one of the fundamental protections in a civilized society. We are now reduced to the level of a police state. I don't blame Bush for asking for this power. I blame a cowardly Congress for granting it. That's one reason the nation rejected the GOP. In answer to the previous post, the President can declare ANYONE, not just foreigners, a "person who might be aiding terrorists", and then hold them indefinitely at an undisclosed location. Effectively, this has entirely negated habeas corpus. The President is not required to explain to a court why he believes someone has aided terrorists, so he could literally choose anyone, and no-one, not even the Supreme Court could require him to produce that person ever again - people can now just 'disappear'.

3662	The President can detain ANYONE, not just foreigners, indefinitely at an undisclosed location. There is no requirement to explain why a person is being detained or where he is being held. Effectively, there has been a 'heavy hand' move on detainees who have been registered with the CIA.  No one can force Bush to turn a spy over to the FBI or the DOJ. Thus he has an absolute leash that can be extended as he wishes. In most civilized nations you have a right to go to a court and demand to see who is keeping you.

3665	It doesn't matter if you like it or not. Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were white collar workers in most states. SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contigency" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case. Contact your local bar association for a reference.
3666	Do you mean "employee"? And what's "unfair dismissal"? The legal definition of "unfair dismissal" is that if you were not hired with the intent to work for the company for a specific number of years, you can be fired for the reason you don't agree with, you must prove this by way of a disputed case. When you work for a company that you are not excited about, it might be more cost-effective for the company to just replace you with a new employee who does have the same position but you have been a customer for years and there is a high level of mutual trust between employees and employers.
3667	Do you mean "employee"? And what is "unfair dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, that means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all.  Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn't mean you have an action against them for firing you.  However, there are restrictions.  Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability).  They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whisleblowers in most states.

3670	There are far, far, far more common and plausible explanations than that why governments might take action in this way. ID cards are highly impractical because they don't reflect all data relevant to you, they make you harder to identity and definitely incur significant risk to your privacy, security and privacy.
3671	In Australia and the US, IDs are not as secure as they used to be and there are many more items that an identity thief would need to take your ID away from you. Therefore, at some point, they will be required and, when it does happen, they will look silly.
3672	By introducing a national ID card in Australia and the USA, identity theft will increase as those with criminal records and confidential information will be 'all identified'. Also, identity theft is most stupid idea and in most countries people get an ID card to prove who they are, or they'll need a passport or driving licence or some other such thing that not everybody has.
3673	ID cards are a dumb idea because someone could have stolen the identity of someone like the prime minister and got all his money. I'd say this is stupid.
3674	It only makes sense to do it if you will at some point get the cards and lose them but unless you use an ID card, you won't have to worry about someone stealing your identity. Also, I think there are 2 countries that actually use ID cards anyway, so it's not the only country it's introduced in.
3675	There is no perfect legal system. The most important thing is that justice is served. There have been cases in history when innocent people have been convicted and served the full rigour of punishment. And there are also cases when guilty people have been acquitted. What does God have to do with these cases? What does he give orders? The US has taken actions against other countries, to kill innocent people. If something like this was commanded by God, then he ordered such a behaviour. God was with all other religions - that's why they were all in agreement to pray for world peace. Yet with the perpetrators of crimes (e.g. the US), he is silent.
3676	I like the way you started: ALL RISE! Yes, there is no legal system that is perfect. Yes, though, I do not trust "God." It's the unfairness, favoritism, and hypocrisy of his followers. For example, if a criminal court summarizes a law, as it did in 13th century, and it sends a criminal to prison for a finite, regardless of the crime, it makes criminality a positive thing (basically, people can achieve that many positive things). Also, if when our country was attacked by the Japs, we turned to the law of countries with the attacked (which we consider ourselves a member of - since Japan attacked them), it would have been ironic because in reality it would have needed the US to defend all member countries of the United Nations, and this would have happened based on their right to defend themselves. So we had to turn to the United Nations itself, since no country would have been able to defend all of its member countries.
3677	All rise! There is no perfect legal system. Moreover, though I do not trust god, this is due to the fact that god does not talk to anyone except the leaders. For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do so. Last, but not without importance was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to Iraq!
3678	Every legal system is not perfect. However, I do not trust a "god." It's due to the fact that god never talks to anyone, except the leaders (which gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god!). This is what happened to the Iraq war. For example, whenever someone attacks someone, the last 16 centuries, they claim that god ordered them to do that! Furthermore, the Bush claim for America to invade Iraq was last, but not without importance.
3679	Even if an entire legal system is perfect there will always be criminals. There is no legal system that is perfect and nobody can believe 100% of what they see.
3680	Personal capitalist, extreme right. I don't like any form of Marxism. I believe a man should be judged by who he is, not his cover. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the Bible. Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and a lack of basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basic theory, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because the laws of nature, namely entropy, will end the world. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and always will. We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish.
3681	Capitalism isn’t ethical. It’s unfair. It’s a system that rewards selfishness over kindness. The right of the wealthy to own and do what they please is not supported by the Bible. The sacrifices and convictions of Abraham are part of God’s plan to build a family of good, trustworthy, kind people. As a former atheist I saw the influence of Capitalism and the greed and lust of the rich on my own family. I also saw the welfare state working against the natural order of things, which is to allow the wealthy enough of a welfare state to live on, while forcing the rest of us to work and pay taxes, which some would argue have a great influence on the behaviour of most people. The USA is one of the wealthiest nations in the world, but we are like a nation of slaves. Everyone is greedy. I saw nothing but hating in America. I am no longer a Christian but still want to see the USA embrace kindness and faith. I am sick and tired of seeing innocent people suffering. Lets use our time and resources to stop war from starting. Humanity cannot survive without compassion.
3682	You support capitalism but at the same time you hate capitalists.  You support religions but at the same time you hate religion.  You support morals but at the same time you hate morals. You think capitalism is silly and morality is stupid. Those two can't coexist. Give me a reasonable answer to that...
3683	Fair trade capitalist.  Extreme right, I hate any form of Marxism, I believe a man should be judged by who he is not his hide. I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is in the Bible, public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics. Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, entropy. The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow. Nothing will change we have always had storms and will always have wars. man is basically selfish
3684	I'm an extreme right anarchist.  I hate Marxism.  I believe a man should be judged by what he is not his hooded.  I believe that the solution for the problems of this world is found in the bible.  Public education is a waste of money, due to the literacy rate and no basic understanding of economics.  Having this as a basis, the world will end one day, not worried about it, because of the laws of nature, namely entropy.  The hatred for Israel and Christianity will continue to grow.   Nothing will change, we have always had storms and always will.  We will always have wars, because man is basically selfish
3685	I agree with you. Unless maybe the person can't for a medical reason, etc. but other than that, Yes, show respect for our country! Our brave soldiers are willing to go fight for America and risk their lives and some people in this country are too lazy to get off of their ass to Pledge Allegiance to the Flag. I think it is wrong. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
3686	It is wrong for some people to stand up and pledge allegiance to the American flag at the beginning of every campaign. I feel that it is wrong for them. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
3687	Yes, it is wrong to deliberately yell out a lot of profanities and hateful words on the Internet. People do this every time they have a disagreement. If they cannot resolve it properly on the Internet, they should consult a psychologist.
3688	I agree with you.

I think it's wrong. I will proudly stand for my country and do everything I can to support it.
3689	I agree that we should be proud of our soldiers who willingly risk their lives to defend our country. However, you cannot support what is not worth supporting and support something that will not carry you forward.
3690	His rights as a human being are not being respected and because we can"t afford a defense attorney for the court, until then, if he can"t make bail or get a bondsmen then he will have to tough it out until his court date. He will have to struggle until he can hire a lawyer. He will have to try to go back to school and be able to get a job or just get his paperwork done if he doesn039;t have money. He will have to confront his situation and take it to the courts. There are only a few people with tons of money to protect them all. Still there is no way to go out like this because people have lost their minds and their hearts and their lives. You cannot just ignore this and pretend this does not exist. People in this world need to look at people like Ben and try to better themselves and their chances to go out into this world. The lives of these kids will be greatly improved if they can be dealt with properly. Sometimes if you do things right, problems dont happen as bad as you thought they would be. Sometimes it is always better to leave it to the gods to decide the outcome of such cases. Another point is if you really
3691	It is an unpopular policy that can only be implemented when the economy is doing well.
3692	Anyone can be released from jail on their own recognizance if they think the person will make a mistake and should be getting a lawyer. So if Johnny wouldn't or didn't want to work out a bail agreement, then he would have to continue his jail sentence.
3693	last time i checked he still has the right to a court appointment, until then if you can't make bail or get a bondsmen then i guess he will have to tough it until his court date. If he hates it so bad, maybe he won't make the same mistake again when choosing a girl. We all have our lessons to learn, some get the rough end for seemingly no reason. Sometimes, but this is life and you can't always come to their rescue. Even when sometimes you feel you need to. Grown up problems come with grown up consequences that are sometimes hard to fix. Sorry
3694	If his lawyer can't make bail, or find a bail bond, he's going to have to let him wait 'till his court date. When teenagers are in trouble, sometimes they like to drag it out as long as possible, and then go to prison. He'll be around for a couple of years, and he might even start to get some good life lessons out of it.
3695	It is not scientifically proven that there is a gene that determines your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice. CMV
3696	We found no scientific evidence to prove that homosexuality is a choice. The fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.
3697	The basis for gay marriage and rights is the idea that being gay is not a choice, and the best way to deny gay couples basic rights is to force them into a false choice.
3698	Scientifically humans are born with the instinct to reproduce with women. So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determine your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.
3699	My instincts are perfectly normal, you should not be ashamed that you are gay. What makes the gay opposite of the straight is their belief in the wrong gene or genes that determine their sexual orientation. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice but it is already understood in the law that homosexuality is a choice.
3700	In point of view even if the value of the small company is huge it shouldn't be used as a means for merging. I want to say "i" twice above. This is why merging of companies should be analyzed carefully and it must be done after asking the employees their will on the change. Also it should be possible to bargain with the employees to get the best conditions. For example if the company B, the acquirer, pay more than the company A to the employees that don't like the merger, we should consider it and check it out.
3701	Although mergers of big companies are carefully analyzed before getting a green light, so as to not distort competition by creating a single company with too much power, the purchase of smaller companies by big companies is not considered problematic, even if the value of the small company is huge. For example, the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a huge amount of personal information, which is Facebook main business model, putting it in a leading position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, but I also feel that some right of our has been violated, the moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent and without giving me an option to opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my data does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
3702	Although mergers between big companies are carefully analyzed before getting a green light, it is difficult to avoid creating a single company that has too much power. For example, the purchase of Whatsapp by Facebook gave Facebook a huge amount of personal information, which is Facebook main business model, giving it the position to sell this data. However, not only has there not been any analysis of the merger, but I also feel that some right of my has been violated. The moment Facebook gained the right to do as it wishes with my data without my consent, it also put me in a bad position and without giving me a choice to opt out and delete the data. Just because I trusted company A with my data does not give company B, the buyer, my trust.
3703	When firms make mergers that include personal data of individuals, which is their main business model, they do not have to go through a scrutiny process, and the individual feels that his/her right has been violated. Therefore, we need to create laws to prevent such a crime

3705	 I live near a large navy base. Everyone in the community worships the military. I understand that what they are doing is brave, but it is to the point where it is viewed as more noble to join the military after high school than to go to college, when in reality, most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad, is viewed down upon in my community. not only is this in my community, but i see it on world news. The military is idolized in television, political ads, and news programs. i don't believe that members of the military are anything special and i think they shouldn't be treated as such.

3709	Only television can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also it is educational.
3710	My view is that someone can take out as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". IMO handguns would be more dangerous than they are, because they are easily concealable. AK-47's and AR-15's are considered assault rifles even though they can't shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon. Just because they look scary doesn't mean they are more dangerous. What say you?
3711	I own a AK-47 with a 10 round magazine as well as a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds. My view is that someone can take out just as many people with a hand gun as they would with an "assault rifle". My opinion is that handguns would be more dangerous because they are easily concealable. AK-47's and AR-15's are considered assault rifles even though they can't shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon. Just because they look scary doesn't mean they are more dangerous. What do you say?
3712	The argument can be made that "assault rifle" or "armor-piercing ammunition" is misleading because "automatic weapon" is a much more descriptive term. We should use less jargon as terms that people already understand.
3713	If someone had an AK-47 with a 10 round magazine and a.40 caliber Springfield Armory hand gun that holds 12 rounds, I would think that they would be able to take out a lot more people with a hand gun. However, I believe that an assault rifle is more dangerous than a handgun because it is easily concealed. An AK-47 or AR-15 is considered an assault rifle even though it cannot shoot any faster than any other semi-automatic weapon. Any semi-automatic weapon can fire more than one shot per second and can put out more powerful rounds. I don't have a opinion on that. What do you think?
3714	An AK-47 with a magazine hold 10 rounds and an AR-15 that holds 12 rounds is just as lethal as the AK-47 with a magazine and 12 handgun rounds or any other semi-automatic weapon. Weapons like this are not scary to me. What do you say?
3715	Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured, then killed by other cars. My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road. It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way. This is not about arguing weather road kill is bad or good for the enviroment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am arguing it is fine to experience no emotion.

3717	Today a cat passed by a busy road and was partially injured and then killed by other cars passing over it. My sister cried out and emotionally watched the poor animal suffer and I however did not felt anything watching it. Since it was a feral and had no owner who cared for it, we don't have much point of looking at it and care about it, so why should we care about it. What we should care about is our own emotional reaction to seeing the animal die, so I am arguing that it's okay to experience no emotion.
3718	My sister's reaction to seeing a cat pass away, crying out emotionally watched very last gasp, seems to be very un-Christian and immature. I do not feel sorry for the cat as it could have been helped but it couldn't be helped. The cat was feral which has no owners to care for it. We don't have a duty of care to it and should not feel anything for it. It's up to its creator to decide how to use the life if it chooses, it isn't our decision and we are not obligated to let the animals use them. We feel no connection to it, as though we are viewing a tree in another field. We are not operating to be empathetic to this animal but are operating to be intelligent and know the facts. By arguing whether road kill is bad or good for the environment, I am arguing whether killing animals is good or bad.
3719	Even if a cat dies in the road, we should not express our emotion about the death as it is not in your life. Moreover, this essay doesn't talk about the future, and the environment.
3720	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared.  Direct deposit is a useful policy that helps automate the process of payroll payments, eliminating paper checks and providing an easier way for employees to request a paycheck. Direct deposit can also help employers save money through reduced paper costs, especially considering the case of people in the United States getting monthly paychecks.  People can also benefit from the direct deposit system, as it eliminates the need to go through the lengthy process of filling out a paper check or submit it to a pay office. For this reason, direct deposit is a much needed policy in the U.S.A. that should be endorsed by banks and the government.
3721	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology, the need for them has disappeared.  Direct deposit is paperless, removes the need for paper checks, for employers to pay their employees.  Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.  In our society, people have access to the Internet. One of the many ways it can be used is by making purchases online.  More and more consumers are buying products online.  The companies that produce televisions (TV), video game consoles (game system), and online computer games (online games) are getting more and more popularity among the people. The importance of television has diminished since the use of digital and video.  The growth of technology, especially the Internet, has made it possible for people to get the news and information they need through the Internet. The main platform for the

3725	Men have been hit hardest by the recession and have not bounced back well. Lots of men remain unemployed, and men are going to college at lower numbers than ever.  Meanwhile, women are being given incentives to go into colleges and fields that men are not. There exist lots of secure jobs (teaching and nursing are the most readily available and accessible examples) that are 90% female, both in the field and in college majors. Considering the higher male unemployment, I think anyone offering a female-specific incentive such as a STEM scholarship should be required to promote a male-specific scholarship to a female-dominated field.  Please CMV.

3730	In my opinion Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure, their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?

3734	At first glance it is a sport but I disagree with this point of view. First of all, Nascar is not a sport but a collection of sub categories such as so called sports car racing, stock cars, championship cars, Viper races, monster trucks, drag racing, OTS, trailer is a sport. Very few people are attracted to it and mostly because it's very expensive for people to get involved. Sports car racing is the ultimate expression of competition and speed. Would anyone watch a F1 race if it was considered a sport? The races are usually held in international venues, for example, Gran Prix in Monaco, which brings the excitement of the world stage to the tiny little town. The drivers are paid to be there and I would bet they do not enjoy the drudge of constant advertising. The race may end in a laugh as a result of an apparently delirious mistake, although commentator couldn't tell what car the driver was driving. I would not dare put myself in such a situation again...and I'm no fan of F1.
3735	Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths. Yet, because of superpowers involved, it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia when the countries essentially did the same thing.
3736	In both the Ukraine and Palestine, a country lost territory, which rightfully belonged to their people. Both of these countries implemented a military presence, one secured their military base, the other wanted their holy land back. Both of these events caused and continue to cause unprecedented instability within these countries. This naturally leads to deaths. Both of these events cause uncertainty because of superpowers involved. But because of that, it can be argued that it should be left alone.
3737	Both of these events have the same problem that in both cases they found themselves with no logical problem, but rather an insoluble problem that they claimed to be the solution.
3738	Both of these events happened within Ukraine and Palestine. It caused and continues to cause unrest within those nations. This leads to deaths and instability. Yet for the sake of superpowers involved, and media hype, people still make these war stories very American vs. Russian.

3740	Like in the good old days, when moral hazard was not a thing, businesses should be run by their directors and owners, who would then have to take the tax payers' money personally if there was a crash, and the directors wouldn't make monetary decisions that took away from the job of the owner or a new CEO.   I don't like the death penalty in general because I don't think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes aren't foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably ARE.  They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
3741	Real leaders of bailed-out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figelheads or sacrificial lambs. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they've since quit. That will encourage them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem. This would also help balance out equity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down more on the poor than the rich. I don't like the death penalty, but corporate leaders probably are. They will think twice before sinking the airship and bailing out with a golden parachute, because they will land on Lady Liberty's sword.
3742	Even though the overall number of tax cuts has been around 1.2 million, the biggest benefits have gone to business because the greatest tax cuts have gone to individuals. Thus creating an economic ripple effect that trickles down to businesses. Why is it bad that some businesses profit during a recession? Well it makes it easier for them to invest in the future.
3743	If business leaders have the personal risk of death by lethal injection, I wouldn't say they won't do foolish things at our expense anymore. They would think twice, but it won't completely deter them. If corporate leaders are the wealthy few that get the death penalty, I think that would create an even more disproportionate impact to anyone below them, since the wealthier are the ones least likely to get the death penalty.
3744	The actual leaders of the bailed out firms should be killed by lethal injection, not figureheads or sacrificial lambs. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out who called the shots, even if they have since quit. The moral hazard created by the bailouts is that business leaders get to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. That encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death will correct this problem. This would also help balance out the inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down on the poor more than the rich.

3745	There are hundreds of states on the planet. All of them engage in aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes the state violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals. It can be justified. For example - imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates violence. Yet many people don't see the aggression by the state as problematic. For most people, a shop robbery is wrong. But tax is justified on the basis of a social contract or other vague concept. We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example - we say 'drafted' when we could say'slave soldier' or 'drug confiscation' when we could say 'theft of herbs.' These euphemisms muddy people's emotions when they encounter situations. One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish Inquisition is to us.

3747	There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage in active aggression against individuals. Sometimes the violence is justified in response to violence initiated by the individual, like the example given above. Another example is taxes that are used to pay for the actions of the government. Many people do not see this as wrong, because the state always defends itself by invoking the "social contract" or some other concept. And the most people, don't see aggressive action by the state in that situation as problematic because they think that it is necessary to live in a peaceful society. Eventually people will see our society run by politicians who use violent and aggressive actions, and it will be as incomprehensible to them as the Spanish Inquisition is to us.

One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as Spanish Inquisition is to us.
3749	There are hundreds of states on the planet and they do engage in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. Sometimes they are in response to individual violence, and then they can be justified. For example, imprisoning a murderer. A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. But most people do not see this aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For most people a shop robbery is wrong. But taxation is justified on the basis of a "social contract" or other vague concept. We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example, we say "drafted" when we could say "slave soldier" or "drug confiscation" when we could say "theft of herbs." These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations. One day, people will look at our society run by politicians using violence and it will be as incomprehensible to them as the Spanish Inquisition is to us.
3750	In order for a good government to properly govern, it needs to know about the needs of society, and it has to collect money by imposing taxes. High taxes do not necessarily mean a good government. I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails.
3751	Government is a good thing when the right people rule it, the tax on people isn't the cost of their government service, and taxes cannot be considered an evil thing.
3752	What is necessary to have a good government is less money, less red tape, more accountability, and less people. A good government is the one that governs least, and thus needs least money. High taxes don't necessarily mean a good government, but a good government needs high taxes to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. So, a good government is one that governs least, and thus needs less money.
3753	For example, look at what structural design looks like inside of the subway system. They don't try to build it as if someone had tried to use it before. The only reason the building is so efficient is because it's built on a lot of wasted practice. So why should a structure that works by following the same process as well as possible get less money? Government needs high taxes to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that it requires, especially due to the huge expense of building important buildings that everybody needs. High taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, but if the government does its job well, it has high taxes to pay for it.
3754	Government is a good thing but just beware what it demands. Too much does nothing but divide. Your soul will not be respected if you live the way you live for this world as the tribe of nomads. For this reason, government as an institution should have a sense of restraint. To use it as a tool to keep an equal society from equality means that we disrespect ourselves.
3755	Men who are very wealthy and famous, and who are younger and decent to good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They don't even need any game to get sex. It's too easy, and too easy = too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV. For this reason, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. It's more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you. Therefore, I believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity.
3756	When the women/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they may be being irrational. Its more likely than not that their husbands will cheat on them. For this reason, i believe that Tiger Woods wife was being delusional when she married with the expectation of no infidelity.
3757	Its quite simple. Men who are very wealthy and famous, even if they are also younger and good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They do not even need a game to get sexual intercourse. Its too easy. Too easy = too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this. So this may be a crappy CMV. Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational.

It's too easy. Too easy = too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.
3759	it has something to do with materialism, I think that for some men, they just have too much money to spend, and this forces them to fuck everything they can.
3760	Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king and basically invoked an ancient and powerful gift. This is what makes the storm cloaks the obvious bad guys, they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
3761	Ulfric usedthuum to kill the king so basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another villain deed, this makes the storm-cloaks the obvious villains they have nothing good to paint them as except for not being the one who want to cut their head off at the beginning. Try to back your claim by proving the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains. 
3762	I'm pretty sure that the characters are racist, they're openly saying so. They also abuse and mistreat different people in different ways. This makes them evil by today's morals. This also makes them the villains, and Ulfric the mastermind. Also, Ulfric used the Thu'um magic to kill the high king, this was a very powerful magic used in the fighting side for a long time. This, along with the story they have told themselves in the narrative, makes them the main villains. At the very beginning, I mentioned that the storm-cloak heroes have been lied to their whole lives. They no longer believe in things like honor and fear and much less in the empires war being a good idea. So far, they have told themselves that we are heroes, and the empires are the bad guys. These characters obviously don't care what we, as the true heroes, think. I think that the storm-cloaks should become the main villains in the story.
3763	For the storm-cloakers to be evil, they must be black and mistreat other races. They have a few redeeming qualities, like not mistreating other races with impunity, but only then due to their own actions. The other problem with them is that Ulfric had them call in storm-assault, an ancient crime brought to them by Aldmeri Dominion.
3764	The storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist, they abuse and mistreat those different from them, this makes them evil by today's morals and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly, Ulfric used th'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys, they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head off at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains.
3765	Though hip hop is really a very diverse genre, there are many parts of this culture that have stemmed from it that are themselves bad for society.  For example, sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing). another is the inherent disrespect with hip hop and just overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. This is despicable.
3766	Through lyrics, behavior, clothes, and other social cues and practices, hip hop has become deeply entrenched in American culture.  Hip hop culture is often criticized for its impact on society, but the impact on society is widely unknown until a negative impact starts to show itself.  Society is always under constant change, and art like hip hop is the means by which the future is made and molded, so its roots can be found in these original ideologies that created hip hop music. Hip hop music is important, and has the potential to accomplish so much in the future.  No one should be denying that, but too often the discussion is confined to the negative impact that it has.  
3767	The music and its source are not associated with a particular race or religion, however, the fact that its created by teenagers without much of a backbone contributes to many of the problems surrounding the music and the youth culture. Because of the unreliability and wealth that goes with hip hop (and porn as well) people simply follow whatever fashion is popular at the time. While it is no doubt true that many rap songs promote immorality, this does not in fact reflect the tone of hip hop. Every culture has its problems and this culture is no exception.  However, it is not the rap music itself that is immoral, it is the people that use it and those who have adopted this culture as a means of expression.  Sexism, racism, and homophobia are bad for society but it is not related to rap music itself.  All this is nothing more than people acting out without much thought or sense.
3768	I think the word they may be looking for is Hip Hop / youth culture that is not necessarily exclusive to black. While again, the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have stemmed from this culture that are themselves bad for society. For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through hip hop and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing). Another is the inherent disrespect that comes with the culture and just overall rudeness. Look at the hundreds of videos of Vine people just destroying others property for laughter, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch. It's despicable.
3769	For hip hop / youth culture isn't just to be only black. The whole hip hop / youth culture (Hip Hop, R&B, Pop, MCs, DJs, Rap, Bands, Rap Phrases, Music, Styles, dances, etc.) is not just reserved for blacks. Black has a big pop culture influence, but some Pop songs, Hip Hop, R&B, Rap, dances, etc. can influence other groups of people as well.  For example, a lot of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through Hip Hop, R&B, Rap, dances, etc.  Also, the inherent disrespect that comes with it is not normal.  Just look at all the videos of people just destroying others' property for sport.  One of the most despicable video that I have seen is of a girl just punching people and stomping on others for sport.  Another is how many celebrities make the appallingly rudeness. I think that for hip hop / youth culture isn't just to be only black. The whole hip hop / youth culture is not just reserved for blacks.  Though black has a big pop culture influence, black, Hip Hop, R&B, Rap, dances, etc. can influence other groups of people as well.  For example, a lot of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through Hip Hop, R&B, Rap, dances, etc. Black, Hip Hop,
3770	We should be able to bury our dead in any location as we see fit since we are not imposing any laws on people to do so.
3771	Example:  Christian A denies carbon dating and fossil records, believes that we are the only intelligent life in all discovered and undiscovered universes, as well as a whole lot of other insane stuff.  Christian B accepts that evolution is true, accepts that the whole concept of god as portrayed in the bible is archaic and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows good christian values, believes in god as simply a 'higher being' and believes that they will be rewarded after death for being a good person.  Christian A does not *deserve* to be taken seriously, they can still have their beliefs without denying whats scientifically proven, but they choose to be ignorant. Having a religion based on faith is fine, I personally have my own spiritual beliefs, but I don't see how you can not take the church of the flying spaghetti monster seriously if you take christian fundies seriously.
3772	The concept of God as portrayed in the bible is outdated and incompatible with the 21st century, but still follows the good Christian values.

3775	I'm not a fan of masturbation. I don't think it's a very good habit to develop, and I actually feel a lot of guilt over it. However, I couldn't resist using this rant as an opportunity to expand on the point. Masturbation sucks so much. You literally do nothing but waste time doing it. Each time you masturbate it sucks the life out of you.  Today I broke my 4 day streak. I feel depressed and stressed, knowing I would just masturbate again sometime later. So, despite everything, masturbation is inherently bad for you. You should feel bad about it.
3776	You should stop masturbating for study's or personal experience. Go ahead and try changing my view with studies or from your experience yourself.
3777	I'm not so good at masturbating; I've only used it once over the last 4 days and I'm feeling depressed. I've heard that it's unhealthy, but to me it seems that it is a very natural act for humans. I don't know much about it, but having been curious about it, I've studied it a bit. I see that masturbation, though harmless, has also led to suicide and lots of violence. All things considered, I'd rather not use it.
3778	Research has concluded that people will masturbate again within a few minutes.
3779	 masturbating is a bad habit. It is stressful and it could change your view of life. There are no studies to substantiate the above info but you could try changing your view. Go ahead and try changing my view.
3780	We are all capable of the horrendous act that Hitler committed or fostered in his life. The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us. I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities he engaged in. But there is historical perspective that could perhaps explain some of his attitudes. The entire concept of eugenics fed right into his Aryan superiority complex. And war is war. People can justify all kinds of horrible things when in that mode. Again, I am thoroughly disgusted by what he did, but I do not discount the possibility that I am capable of horrible things myself if I do not keep a focus on continually learning and growing and evolving in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
3781	... All of those terms are a monstrous, shocking idea. My absolute opinions about his conduct are irrevocable...Evil, hateful, etc... I only wish that this website had not come to light because in the near future it could spawn violence... I hope it won't, but if it's ever a possibility...I am not going to tolerate the thought that this man ever got off scot free.  I stand for justice for crimes committed against all human beings on the planet and will forever be vigilant.

3785	Anything we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the things that we consider beautiful inside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner. I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.

3790	One cannot decide whether or not one sex is greater in intelligence than the other. It will all depend upon the individuals themselves. There may be a group of males that are very intelligent, there may also be a group of males that are very low in intelligence. This may also be happening within the females, some females may be very intelligent while others are not so fortunate. This being said, with all of the highly intelligent individuals from each sex, and all of the non-intelligent people from each sex, they even out each others intelligence in which makes them of equal intelligence.
3791	On a side note, it is very unhealthy for both males and females to live in extremes. Males have to be tough, yet not too rough and females have to be very soft, but not too soft. If they did that they would be very weak both mentally and physically, in which they would be considered to be useless. It is important to remember that the extremes of the males and females are always a perfect balance. One cannot decide whether or not one sex is greater than the other. It will all depend upon the individual themself. There may be a group of males that are of high intelligence. There may also be a group of males that are very low in intelligence.

3795	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still such attractive features to non-Americans that we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day.

3800	Just look at our own bodies, we have residues of our ancestors, we shiver and get bimps like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including that what was created would evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve. It's all part of the Master's plan. I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations.

3802	First, in what sense are we at our point of diminishing return or diminishing improvement? The supply of all organically based foods is limited, even though the use of fertilizers and chemicals can increase production by 1000%! What I mean is that we consume a lot of foods with no value other than what humans have put into them, and that food processing kills all the value. Perhaps a better comparison might be as a concern, since the demand for meat, eggs, fish, all dairy, honey, and even many fruits and veges is a function of protein consumption in our diets, and our diets have little to offer but that too has been minished due to our excessive industrial nutrition from industrially produced foods and food additives. In addition, we do not have the technology to produce food from recycled water, which provides the nutrients with no waste while avoiding the use of the arable land and resources used for farm production which also greatly increases food costs. By far, the biggest benefit of organic food is the reduction of chemical and pesticide contamination. Having said that, some improvement is possible, e.g. it's possible to manage pests like vines by using lower doses of pesticides while maintaining yield. Finally,
3803	Just look at our own bodies, we have signs of our ancestors on us, we shiver and get boars like reptiles, our hair stands on its end when frightned and we all have tail bones, I am not an atheist, I believe in God, I just believe that God set things up with the creation of the universe knowing what would happen including that what was created would evolve and turn into life and that life would continue to evolve, it's all part of the Master's plan-I have no conflict between believing in God and evolution and neither do a growing number of progressive believers of God of various denominations

3805	The oil used in today’s vehicles has outlived its use. There is enough plastic that simply recycling what is unused could supply more plastic. All plastic is recyclable. Battery technology has existed for nearly 10 years now and can give a car up to 400 miles on a single charge. That exceeds many gas-run vehicles on the road today. All production use oil damages the environment, causes numerous diseases, and is the primary cause of global warming. Oil spills kill hundreds of thousands of animals per year, as they continue to affect the area of the spill decades after it occurred. Oil is the primary interest of the US in the middle-east.

3810	In point of view if you respect animals then you must never support caging them up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course, nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by substantial amounts of people because, for the most part, animals are viewed as inferior, which then justifies locking them up. Fuck zoos.
3811	No opinion regarding that right now. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. F*** zoos.
3812	In point of view, I'm against putting an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. I think it is cruel. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. Fuck zoos.
3813	Here is a petition from me that says I would be in favor of that. I have personal convictions that would never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people, because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior. F*** zoos!
3814	Personal convictions is a bad idea because we should never use personal convictions to infringe on animals. Animals are meant to be free, of course not everything can be taken seriously but it's very nice to go around thinking things. I'm just saying there has to be an appropriate educational approach instead of a caging your animal behind bars.
3815	One could say the same thing about if you are bombing cities where you did not invade, killing people without their knowledge or permission...where you did not get in a war, where you did not do physical violence...if you are bombing cities like Baghdad, Irak, Dresden, Kosovo, Christchurch, Manchester, Nice, Copenhagen....if you are bombing an entire country because your god wants to us to do it...most people feel very strongly that such bombing is not right or justified and that is what I think is going on in this case.
3816	There are cases where we have to have privacy on the web. However, if you have nothing to hide....or are not reconnoitering sh*t, no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people post sh*t online attacking others but hide their identity? To me it is.
3817	In cases such as privacy, yes, it is annoying when people post things online attacking others and hiding their identity. However, if you have nothing to hide and are not reconnoitering sh*t, no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people, for instance, post sh*t online attacking others but hide their identity? Yes it is.
3818	Only when your identity is hurt or affected in some way can you try and defend yourself. In certain cases, it is necessary to have privacy on the web. However, if you have nothing to hide, or are not reconnoitering shit, no need to hide your identity. Is it annoying when people, for instance, post sh*t online attacking others but hide their identity? To me it is.
3819	Whether you think it should be enforced by law or not, privacy is a fundamental right. It's pretty unreasonable to expect people to publicly post information about each other without consent. Is it annoying to people when people post information about people on the web that they don't want people to know? To me it is.
3820	As of now Pride has more talent than UFC. Pride has fighters from all over the world, where UFC is limited mostly to North America. It's not a USA vs the World argument, just means there's a bigger talent pool to pick for Pride. Crocop & Rampage have their reasons for coming over (who's to say Pride didn't send them over to promote Pride in the US), but still too many good fighters left in Pride, ie. Fedor.

3823	All the fighters from Pride have talent from all over the world, not just North America. All the fighters of UFC are from North America, except for Colby Covington, Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway and Eddie Alvarez. Colby Covington is not an American. In fact, C. Covington’s father is a British citizen. Eddie Alvarez, Max Holloway, and Charles Oliveira are US citizens. In case you haven't noticed, the number of fighters in Pride is larger than the number of people in the United States. As for Cris Cyborg, she is not an American. That’s why only about 5% of the fighters of Pride are Americans. Thats a fair comparison. The pride fighters are almost international now, and more fighters are signing up in Pride than in UFC. The biggest difference between UFC and Pride is that Pride has fighters from all over the world. You can’t find that kind of diversity in UFC. Therefore, there is much more talent in Pride than
3824	There's a much bigger talent pool to pick fighters for the pride organization. Crocop and Rampage have their reasons for coming over (who's to say pride didn't send them over to promote pride in the US), but still too many good fighters left in pride, ie. Fedor.
3825	One band may in theory greatly influence the genre of music, but ultimately it's the artists that carry the torch and it's the artists that actually do the music. I don't know anyone who actually listened to the Beatles and who didn't gravitate to rock and roll over time. Not even the Beatles fanatics.
3826	Don't give me all those "They changed the way we make music" or "They were so deep" crap. I listen to rock and roll for what it is. When I listen to rock music, my standard of greatness is whether or not this song makes me want to crank my stereo up or not. I can't think of a single Beatles song that I can simply turn on and rock out to. The Who hands down.

3830	Humans are not able to live without the help of machines. This is seen in the hospital, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive, save them when they are on the brink of death. Further more, hand phones, cars, mp3 players and the infamous PSP that we see thousands of children, teens and adults playing as well clearly show us mankind's huge dependence on machines.

3835	Not that I'm judging you from any other life experience. I just think you're looking down on your older siblings and not reflecting on your own life.
3836	It would be nice to know, what you think...and learn about different cultures and why people have different customs...but no, I can not. I am NOT ok with people judging MY choices with what they think their better than my life choice. WE have to face the REALITY. If you really loved me, you would follow what I do and RESPECT my choices. The choice is NOT mine to question...it's ME that makes the decision and either gets or doesn't get it right. I'm just sorry if this isn't the choice you would love to make but only you know ME...and I know you...and we will all learn a little someday.
3837	Not how I would want to earn my living. BUT, what right do I have to judge what some one else does with their life? I have enough trouble keeping track of ME. I have realized I can do much of the same things even though I don't have to chase all the things that men do. Women, however, are supposed to be more responsible. When I was younger I might have answered this question a bit differently. Life has a way of changing the way you look at it as you mature. I am only responsible for me and I will have to answer for whatever I have or haven't done. Anybody that doesn't think I'm right probably has a few more life experiences before them.

3840	People are essentially good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are essentially good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness.

3844	I would argue that people are essentially good. That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs, but that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad.

3845	Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis. Okay, but keep in mind that he has admitted that he is not his strong suit, so I let him slide on that too. What stops him from giving up just a few hours to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances? Because of that, I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances, he's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something else to do.

3850	The American way of doing it is similar to that of Denmark. The people vote for several politicians who they agree with the most, and that gives them a greater say in making the laws.
3851	Yes, there are several times "no" is the correct answer. Dictatorships have called themselves republics (an example for nerds is Star Wars). In fact, Republicans and Democrats are the same. In both the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them. The people choose those who agree with them, the only difference is the different countries' ways to do it. For an example, Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses 1 president....but still, the people choose, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
3852	The examples for dictatorships are better Republicans and Democrats the same. In both forms, the people vote for the person/persons they want to "rule" them, they choose those who agree with them, the only difference is that the different countries have a different way to do it. For example: Denmark uses the way where the people vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc. USA chooses one president, but STILL: the people choose, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
3853	Yes it is. There are several times 'no' is the correct answer though dictatorships have called themselves a republic (the example for nerds: the republic in star wars). But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same.

3854	Yes, dictatorships have called themselves republics (the example for nerds, the republic in star wars). But in fact, there are Republican and Democratic parties, where the people vote for the party they like most. The ones who agree with the party's ideals vote for the party. The only difference is the different countries' way to do things. For an example, Denmark uses a democratic system. The people (18+) vote for several parties, where the voters vote for those parties, to form a part of the MPs, who vote for the laws etc. USA chooses 1 president....BUT STILL: the people choose, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose "the chosen ones".
3855	The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a right of all people. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit for happiness. If that right gets taken away, some people who lost it might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if GLBT community can get their rights taken away, then what will happen with the rights of those who are not GLBT?
3856	The Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage has angered thousands across the country. For some, the rise of LGBT rights is a setback for the country, for others, they argue it leads to an opportunity to create new, safer environments for LGBT members. Is this second group right? Are your rights being removed, or just changing hands?
3857	Why? Why go out of your way to take away some ones rights? We have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. For some getting married might be one of the milestones along that pursuit of happiness. If the right to marriage gets taken away, those people who lost the rights might not be truly happy. All I have to ask is, if GLBT community can get their rights taken away, then, Whos next?
3858	If gay people can lose the right to get married, why can others not as well? All I have to ask is, if the gay community can get their rights taken away, then, Whos Next?

3860	Although it is not technically correct (web 2.0 is not a new iteration of the web), the mass adoption of a technology requires two important things: 1) A technology that works and 2) a hook that the audience and business adopters can understand. Web 3.0 is a name that people will be able to relate to, mass marketers can use it, etc etc. I know it's a flimsy argument, but it will irritate a lot of people and myself, including you, if this happens.

3865	Darla is not currently represented by a lawyer because at this point, Darla is confined to her home and unable to leave, and Darla is required to remain in contact with the Task Force who are on the case and who are working to locate Darla and care for her needs. Darla has also filed a formal complaint against Lizzie and the Roryans regarding her being subjected to this abusive treatment by the Lizzie and Rayna have not made any changes to the decision to remain anonymous and to retain their right to remain unnamed at this time. On July 29, Darla and her parents filed a report against the defendant officers claiming that she was a victim of a violation of the civil rights act. Please understand that Darla is not represented by a lawyer at this point. She is confined to her home at this time.
3866	I play guitar and don't feel like I'm trying hard. I believe I'm quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh, yeah, and I LOVE GUITAR HERO! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed. PS. Can people try and spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates? I mean, come on, they let ya know when you've misspelled a word. Although whoever created this one spelled the word correctly. They just typed the completely wrong word.

3870	When men traditionally dominate and in a society where a great majority of people consider lesbian attractive, a man's general consensus is more popular than women's. I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. However, gay women are more socially acceptable because they are under the presumption of "mirror image" for men, women are inferior to men, but gay women aren't. Gay men are under a different snare, because the "romantic interest" they have is a woman-only attribute, giving them an honor that straight men don't get.
3871	In a society traditionally dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. Additionally, gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates, he is lowering himself to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor. The preceding is my interpretation of modern society, as you read it, and it is not my opinion.
3872	Generally speaking, a society dominated by men is more popular than a society dominated by women. Therefore, in a society where women have the power, their opinion is more likely to be favored.
3873	In the 21st century, society is heavily dominated by men. Most people's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. Further, gay men are discriminated against because they do not have honor. Romantic interest in men is for women only, and when they participate, they are 'lowering themselves' to a women's level. Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute giving them honor. The preceding is not my opinion, but my rather cynical interpretation of modern society.
3874	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
3875	Frankl was a psychiatrist who was a prisoner in a concentration camp and during world war 2. He said that in such a terrible condition, he felt free because he can choose to go insane or keep the calm. Not only he felt free, he was free because freedom is choice and he chose the path he wanted. People can say that freedom is the ability to do what ever you want but conditions are characteristics of freedom, every choice have a consequence and in this case if I choose to steal a bank tomorrow I'm going to jail ( if the police catch me XDD ) and if you choose a path you should accept the consequence
3876	which children are being born? what are they doing? what are they earning for examp the number of babies with disabilities has dramatically go from per thousand births in 1960 to per thousand births in 2013 freak out - bugs bayya har sont no history
3877	Freedom is a characteristic of everybody and the means or the circumstances can change that power. Victor Frankl said that freedom is choice and you don't choose in the concentration camp or the holocaust, you do something else when you are a prisoner in the Holocaust. Freedom is the capacity to do what you want when you have freedom of choice. That will be your capacity when you grow up or when you have a choice in life.
3878	The military is becoming more important in world politics these days. It is used to end wars and threaten other states and it is used by dictators to hold back their subjects. The military often does violence or acts as a terrorist organization and bombs civilians and innocent people. I think that the military needs to become more educated about their ethical responsibilities and it should donate some of its funds to charity. In addition, government must become less interested in favoring the military and it should implement more law enforcement and put a stop to the brutality and civilian killing by the military. Sometimes, when government abhors the killing of civilians and innocent people, the military should not be a part of the government. Everyone knows what brutalities happened during WW2, but it didnt stop people from becoming cruel again and it didnt stop people to think that all democracy is evil. So the military must learn from its past and donate some of its funds to charities and create a civilized society. 
3879	When I was a prisoner in a concentration camp I feel free because I can choose to go insane or keep the calm. Not only I feel free, but I was free because Freedom is choice and I chose to feel calm. So, when people say "Freedom is the capacity to do what ever you want" they are wrong. All a choice imply a consequence. I can choose to steal a bank if they catch me, and it will be a consequence to me. Freedom, in reality is a choice. Freedom can be defined as an act of doing nothing as much as it is to take a better job, or to be free of an urge or a condition...
3880	It was over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does
3881	TV is better than books because it can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
3882	The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic in that they are based on a much more real future with less technological assumptions made. The game play is completely engrossing and there is a fairly open playing field for noobies and more experienced players. The interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes and because you are not distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. It is not over hyped and does present the same replay value to me that GRAW does.
3883	On the 360 the graphics are actually superb and more realistic, obviously, as its based in a much later time with less technological assumptions made. The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field for noobies and more experienced players, the interface has been designed with a classic FPS style with only a few changes to the tinkle which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc. And I actually think GRAW is the best military multi player game on the system.  The graphics are great and obviously more realistic (being based in a much later time with less technological assumptions made). The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing field for noobies alongside more experienced players. The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc.

3885	In point of view, although the cheapest place could be Burgerboyz or Fat Bastard it was not better then a Chick-Fil-A. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito, with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely more expensive then a fast food like Chick-Fil-A which is more than $10. I can't think of anything positive to say about them. So, really give this one a skip.
3886	Is really really bad. Terrible when compared to other burrito places like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito, with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help, and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other, cost me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

It was definitely cheaper than the other, cost me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! Would definitely not recommend.
3890	My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos from a tasty chip to ones that are meh. For a Mexican place you would think they would stay with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these sub par chips. We will not be ordering out guac / salsa / and chips anymore. Why bother,

3895	For me their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!).
3896	My husband tried smoked meat here and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out, instead of having long lines.
3897	My husband (the American and stingy with his stars) has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami/corned beef) so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since for me their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!).

3900	Not impressed with my tea experience at Jade Mountain, looked for a place to stop in Madison while on business trip and found this place.  I was planning to do some work in the tea shop but it was very warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done.  The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh so that was good.  I got a mango fruit tea and it was too sweet and there was no ice in it so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls.  The tea was much better when I was able to add ice into it.  The kid who helped me didn't seem to excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me and I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops.  This was good but not great.

3903	The tapioca pearls were excellent but unfortunately they were too warm to do anything but top off my favorite green tea.  The ice helped and it is nice to get the same lid as I find at most bubble tea shops.  I like the place but I would not call it my favorite.

3905	Generally, Burgers are good but just not worth the price.  Ordered the holy smokes with the chips and the coke and the fried chicken patties (cut up fries that are like chips) and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was about $20! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.  The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify the price for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper!  I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get it again because of that.
3906	It is not inexpensive to dine in a McDonalds or pizza parlor. Burgers are tasty and some worth the price. Ordered the holy smokes with frees and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.  I was having difficulty with how the price could justify what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper!

3910	K O’Donnells is definitely the place to be! When it comes to food, this place has everything! You can’t go wrong with anything on this menu. Not only do they have the stellar food, they have an award winning doggy patio! I bring my dog very frequently to socialize with other dogs. If your looking for a stellar happy hour come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers! You can’t go wrong with the daily specials and those speciality martini’s!
3911	The Perks o' being a Wall Street Journal subscriber are 2 fold, firstly, they are very generous with their subscriptions. Secondly, they've gotten several awards, most importantly the yellow candy apple scheme!
3912	K O'Donnells is definitely the place to be! The food, which is stellar, was just about the nicest take out we ever had. We brought the kids who loved seeing the corkscrews out in the sidewalk. I got my drink and some lemonade while my partner got the entree and iced tea. The place has great customer service and they have a dog FREE dine in patio! The happy hour is daily and if you want a martini made by the crew place it on their Specialty Martini box!

3914	That's right! No one has heard of this place before in New York or Manhattan! That's the right place for anyone who wants to eat their heart out! The daily specials are available through thursday! They have food for every taste and place to have a seat. Let's be honest, people don't come here because they have to but because they like it. The happy hour is a fun night and if you make a reservation you get in free! And of course there are some martinis that no one else has access too! The place could be smaller but it is big enough to hold any occasion. Trust me, people come here because they love the food, the happy hour, and the martinis. I go there every week on thursday for my happy hour...I recommend it! I love working here and am very proud to be a part of the O'Donnell family.
3915	The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us and asks us about our day. I switch off from a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price. I love having a healthy quick option to go eat lunch or dinner. Would definitely recommend this to others.
3916	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
3917	Frequent customers at this chipotle! It is nice and close to my house. It is located near the happy valley round about which can get super busy when everyone is getting off work so we like to go early or a little later to avoid the rush. It's also busy so the line gets lunch especially at lunch time but is typically pretty fast. Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly.

3920	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed that it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.

3924	One of our group stayed in the hotel during the show and found it to be clean and well maintained. The hostesses were not all that friendly because it was busy. The buffet itself was clean and comfortable. The food was average at $70+/each, but it was also pricey for what it was. Next time we're in Vegas we will consider staying at a different place.
3925	Clothes are cool, and if you can wear them it's cool.
3926	Clothes are cool because your own clothes are cool. If you get to wear what you want it's cool.
3927	for example you can wear what you like if your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want its coolio hoolio.
3928	You should wear clothes that make you look cool or sexy. If you get to wear clothes that make you look sexy you are cool or sexy.
3929	In point of view, if you own your own clothes, and you can wear what you want, that's cool.
3930	Firefox takes the best features from its predecessors and puts them all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.

3935	It's easily. I use Linux, and thanks to god, not existing an IE version to Linux! Firefox is open, you can do anything with that and no one will process you about that; it is safe; cute; have addons; easy install; patches realeased in less time, etc, etc...

3940	It has nothing to do with Steve Jobs or Apple and while Firefox/mozilla has a lot of features similar to them, it is completely different and unrelated company.
3941	Who said anything about FF/mozilla having anything to do with steve jobs/apple? Seperate enititys, not in the least bit attached! We should stop trying to convince the lowly clunker that whenever you plug a PC into an electrical outlet you not only turn on electricity, you also turn it on by pulling up those backsets and changing settings by just turning on and off different components! After spending decades trying to reprogram the mouse I know these things don't do anything when the circuits are closed. They're just a fancy way to tell which is which. However, it's only in the realms of high finance that they actually care. It’s why they believe that the

3943	The worst ones are IE on PCs. It blows when making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to the world wide web consortiums standards much closer than IE ever did or will.

3945	If my wife had told me that she trusted me to support her and help her I'd be furious and maybe even divorce her depending on how the murder was executed.
3946	If my wife confided in me, then I would not betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her, and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder, whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.

3948	The right to kill someone is not based on what I think of his character as a person but on what he had done to her. I would not be justified in killing a predator or a violent criminal.
3949	If my wife or girlfriend or friends trusted me to support or help them then I wouldn't be angry. I would be very upset if she didn't trust me to do that and I would try to prove them wrong, but that's not going to help in any case. I wouldn't make trouble for them unless I was really angry.
3950	India will not lead the world because of the gap between the rich and poor and they still have a strong belief in the caste system.
3951	India won't lead the world because the rich and poor are not evenly distributed and still believe in the caste system.
3952	India will not lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too great and because they still heavily believe in the caste system.
3953	India is not going to lead the world because the gap between rich and poor is too great. They still heavily believe in the caste system.
3954	India won't lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too great and they still heavily believe in the caste system.
3955	This idea is completely absurd. We should all start together and that's the way it should end. Everyone has their own ways to do things. This is just not logical.
3956	This doesn't make any sense. No one country should lead the world we all started together and that's the way it should end. Everyone has their own ways, this is just not logical at all.
3957	This doesn't make sense. People should live in peace and in love no one country should lead the world. All the countries have had it been and everyone has had it be that way. This is just not logical at all.
3958	This idea is absurd, in reality, the world has grown into a community and it doesn't make sense that anyone must lead the world. Everyone has their own way and that's how it should end.
3959	It doesn't make sense that one country should lead the world. We started together and that's the way it should end and everyone has their ways. This is just not logical at all
3960	Thanks for your comments. You are right that I have considered all possible areas to solve the problem. However, not all problem can be solved and not all solutions are feasible. Moreover, there are many other things I have not mentioned. So, there is no point in asking specific solutions. I will suggest that you go for a descriptive text based essay and give your own definition for happiness.
3961	Yes, we are aware of the problems that are facing our country but unable to give solutions. No one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty? Everyone should understand that their importance and role for the country. Because a good citizen is a criminal, terrorist, corrupted politician, everyone is a human, then why is someone creating a problem for another human. I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
3962	If a country is telling the truth then the people of that country must say the truth. If they are not talking the truth then they are still not able to find any solution to the problems that they are facing. They are criticizing government, terrorism and so on. No one realizes that being a citizen what is our duty? Everyone should understand about their importance and role for their country. Because a good citizen, a criminal, terrorist, corrupted politician, everyone is human, then why a human is creating problems for another human. I hope you will think my views and reply me soon.
3963	Unfortunately, many of us do not know about the importance of the government and our duty as citizens. Everyone should understand their importance and role for the country because a good citizen, a criminal, a terrorist, corrupted politician, or anyone who is human, should not create problems for another human. I hope you will think of my views and answer me soon.
3964	We should overcome problems by looking at them from a positive angle. Those who criticize government, terrorism, and corrupt politicians should understand their importance and role for the country. Because a good citizen, criminal, terrorist, corrupted politician, they all are human and don't realize that they are creating a problem for other human. I hope you will think my thoughts and reply me soon.
3965	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
3966	Being fatherless would be preferable to having a lousy father. I want to be good role models to look up to and be a good example to talk to. Not someone who's never there.
3967	Being a fatherless child is a horrible experience. I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
3968	I'd rather be fatherless than have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and talk to. Not someone who is always there.
3969	Being fatherless would be a more pleasant experience than having a bad father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is always away.
3970	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A fatherless existence is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
3971	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A good father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
3972	There are enough heartaches that being fatherless would bring a person. A terrible father could come into your life and walk out on you, and he could do so just because he knows nothing about you or you know nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
3973	In all honesty, not knowing what your father was like would only be heartaches. A lousy father could come in and out of your life and do nothing to truly satisfy you. I would prefer him never existed. To me, having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because I cannot ever say I know what he was like. Having no idea if he was caring, loving, or simply just ineffectual would be the only heartbreak. Having a father who does nothing is a lack of my own father, it is him, yet he does nothing, and his presence is so small, so insubstantial, and my knowledge is not useful to me.

3975	To be able to have a successful trading port, you must have good contacts with many people. Raffles had those contacts, without him we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to mention that Raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in good position to do so. He invested a lot and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform WHY because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest time and effort in such a project.
3976	Obama was in a high position and he could do something like invest money time and effort in such a project. We credit him as the "founder" of health reform because he was in such a high position that he could do something like invest money time and effort in such a project.

3980	Some would say that Raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquar in charge, therefore he neglected us. Imagine Singapore Studies: Teck Puat and Ngee Ann Polytech, have done so much for us, and are considered the founders of us. Are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care of their own schools, and now you want to say that because Lee Hsien Loong took a day off for family time, does he no longer deserve to be our prime minister? He has a family life too!

Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!

Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Loong took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
3983	Some people would say that Raffles left Singapore for a few years and left Farquar in charge. Therefore, he neglected us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care of their own schools. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life!
3984	However, there is a scenario where Raffles might have left us in charge and Farquer might have been in charge and there might be slight differences in policy. What would be the implication? How different would Singapore have been without them? Would you say that we should forget them now that they have returned to Singapore? If Lee Hsun Lioeng took a day off for family time, would you say he is not our Prime Minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting Singapore? He has a life.
3985	If it's still porn and there is smoking hot lesbian content, there's no problem.
3986	Perverting sexually nude women is wrong, unless it's sex that includes hot lesbian images. I'm downloading porn right now!
3987	If porn has hot lesbian sex, porn is wrong. If porn has nothing to do with lesbian sex, porn is not wrong.
3988	Calling porn wrong is a misunderstanding. Pornography can include intimate scenes from a variety of different sexual activities or practices.
3989	to show nudity in the story is not wrong. unless it has cigarettes to put in it like using hardcore smoking or colorful lesbians 
3990	If people watch porno, we will want to make a free sex. Then you will face several diseases, specially HIV. Morally, it is wrong.
3991	It's wrong that pornography exists and whether people watch it, it can be beneficial if people pay attention to what they are watching.
3992	People should not watch porn because it brings AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases like HIV.
3993	Watch porn is wrong.... If people watch it we'll want to do free sex.... Free sex will bring a disease especially HIV.... In morally, it's wrong...
3994	I agree with Pornography. If people watch it they will be compelled to do a free sex which would only lead to rape and same HIV infection. In morality it is wrong but if you really cannot live without it you could just watch it in private and leave no trace.
3995	Depending on your beliefs, it is OK to kill babies that do not belong to you.
3996	It depends on your beliefs. Because I am a Christian I believe it is, but to someone else who isn't a Christian it might be completely ok.
3997	You should believe whatever you want. Depending on your beliefs people have different kinds of practices that are not the same and cannot be compared.
3998	Depending on your beliefs. This is just an opinion and doesn't affect me.
3999	Whether one is a believer or not, I say it's just plain awesome.
4000	Why are we here is a larger issue than how we got here, which is why I'm rooting for Trump
4001	It shouldn't be about how we got here but why are we here?
4002	It should not be about how we got here. But it is about why we are here and how we will get there.
4003	It shouldn't be about how we got here, but why are we here.
4004	In fact, there should be no argument about why we are here.

4016	Well personally I believe Google Chrome is the worst but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
4017	Well personally I believe Google Chrome is the worst and I find it crashes all of the time.
4018	Google Chrome is the best web browser because it is faster, more customizable, and more reliable than Mozilla Firefox
4019	Since Chrome is the better browser, Google has basically decided that they don't care about a smaller percentage of users and is more invested in running their product smoothly for everyone.

4025	Physical education teaches kids that the way they view life (nerd or jock) is not important because if they are all in the same class and doing the same thing then they are all the same in the sense that they only pass that class if they put forth effort. From personal experience sometimes there is a jock underneath the nerd outside
4026	Whether you're a nerd or a jock, if you all all in the same class doing the same thing, you're all the same in the aspect that they only pass that class if they put forth effort. And from personal experience, there is a jock underneath the nerd outside.
4027	Physical Education teaches kids that it's not important what school they go to, because if they're all in the same class doing the same thing, they all have the same chance of passing the class, if they put in enough effort. And from personal experience, sometimes there's a nerd underneath the jock outside the room.
4028	There is nothing wrong with jocks or nerds. Physical education teaches them that effort in different fields makes a difference in their achievement. From personal experience, there is a jock underneath the nerd.
4029	Physical education teaches kids that it doesn't matter if you're a nerd or a jock because if they're all in the same class doing the same thing, they are all the same in the aspect that they only pass that class if they put forth effort.

4030	The answer is really so obvious. Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can strengthen their mussels and get thinner and more flexible. Instead of letting them have as much free time as they can and give them heavily industrialized food and make them fatter and lazier so they won't get bullied as much.
4031	It's obvious the answer to the question of why kids get bullied. Teachers should let kids do physical exercise, so they can strengthen their muscles and get thin and flexible instead of fat and lazy, so they won't be bullied.
4032	Teachers should let everyone exercise to make the school look and feel less angry and less intolerant.
4033	Exercising is the answer. Teachers should let everyone exercise so they can get leaner and more flexible instead of fatter and less lazy so they won't get bullied as much.
4034	The answer is so obvious, teachers should allow their students to exercise so they can get stronger and thinner and more flexible, and avoid getting bullied, and get thin.
4035	It is very important that people participate in physical activity to live a long, healthy life. About 114000 people have died in 2011 so far because of the lack of physical activity. People are becoming obese!
4036	Physical education should be mandatory in elementary school, because 112,000 people have died in the year 2011 so far, and it's because of the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese!!!
4037	Physical education should be mandatory as more and more people are dying from the lack of physical activity and people are becoming obese! It is also said that there will be more cases of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.
4038	Physical education should be mandatory so that 112,000 people have not died in the year 2011 so far and because it helps to lose weight, and people are becoming obese!
4039	Regular physical activity is important and people are becoming obese because of the lack of physical activity.
4040	The compulsory classes to teach P.E. can help the problem of obesity.
4041	In this society, obesity is a problem that is on the increase among children and adolescents, so it is advisable that in the school more physical education is included, in order to prevent overweight,
4042	I think that PE classes should be obligatory in school to help the obesity problem.
4043	PE classes should be required for all students to help the obesity problem.
4044	PE classes should be mandatory in school to help the problem of obesity.
4045	Because today lots of students are playing computer games when the school finish. And then students can't get good health and also students can get serious diseases like cancer because of electromagnetic waves. This is true because computer have lots of electromagnetic waves.

4055	Excluding [Farquhar] from his position in Singapore unjustly and accusing him of being too close to the local population is unfair. He contributed so much to the country's development.
4056	The removal of Farquhar from his position in Singapore was unjust. It was unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be sent off like that.
4057	It is unfair to the laureate that Raffles unjustly removed him from his position in Singapore and accused him of being too close to the local population. I think it is unfair that someone who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.
4058	The privileging of Farquhar was unjust, and he should not have been given up this position. He should be reinstated to his position.
4059	Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of being too close to the local population. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be sent off like that.
4060	The right to abortion should not be abused, however I believe that the choice should be provided, NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.
4061	The right to abortion should not be abused, but I do believe that the choice should be provided. NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.
4062	Abortion should not be abused. I do not believe that abortion should be provided. Nobody should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.

4065	Stop trying to tell someone that she should kill herself in attempt to kill her baby. It's her choice. How do you know that she just would not kill herself?
4066	It's a woman's choice whether to have sex or not. You can't control her. You don't know exactly what she is thinking and you would assume that she would kill herself and her unborn baby and that the baby is not mine.
4067	It's her decision, you cannot control her. How do you know she wouldn't kill herself?
4068	It's the woman's choice. You cannot control her. (Anyone could do something like that.)
4069	It's the mother's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do you know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)
4070	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision. If a woman can't support a child (emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.
4071	When making the choice of whether or not to have a child, it's important that the parent has control over the decision. No parent should be forced to give up a child.
4072	Don´t know why but I don't want to give up a child. Maybe it's a decision made by God because I don't think anyone in this world can accept having a child born into the world. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? If a woman can not support a child emotionally, physically, or financially, she should have right to choose to give up that child.
4073	As a mother you have to have a lot of courage to decide to give up a child, and there's a big responsibility. If a woman cannot support a child financially, emotionally, and physically, she should have the right to decide not to have that child.
4074	When a woman can not support a child she should have the right to choose to give it up to make her own decision. Giving up a child is no doubt a very sensitive decision, especially when it comes to the emotional part of it. If a woman can not support her child she should have the right to choose to give it up to make her own decision.
4075	It really depends the situation. If a girl or woman gets raped, it is not fair that she has to keep the child. If a teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.
4076	It really depends the situation. If a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child that's her fault for not being prepared.
4077	It depends the situation if a girl gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child that's their fault for not being prepared.
4078	It's not fair that she should keep the child because she got raped. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, it's her fault for not being prepared.
4079	It's not fair to a woman if a girl/woman gets raped and so she has to keep the child, but it is more responsibility on the perpetrator if a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child.
4080	Women are people too and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
4081	Live babies who will grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? Yes, women should have the choice to what they bring into the world.
4082	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers. Women's bodies are their own as well. So, shouldn't they be able to decide what is best for their bodies and lives?
4083	Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
4084	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be soldiers, which is ironic, right? Women are people too and it should be their choice what they bring into the world.
4085	Over time, we have adapted to whatever we have needed most. Without these adaptations we wouldn't have existed.
4086	Its simple, how would we be able to adapt to different enviroments. Over time we adapted to what suited us best. If it didn't suit us then we wouldn't be here today.
4087	An over time we adapt to our environment depending on what suits us best otherwise why arn't we one skin colour why there are so many different types of animals
4088	It is simple, how could we adapt to different environments. Over time, we have adapted to what suited us best and thus why are we one skin colour, why are there so many types of animals?
4089	It is simple how we adapt to different environments. Over time we adapted to what suited us best, otherwise we would be one skin colour. There are so many types of animals because they all have adapted to different environments.
4090	like porn, jerking off is always a good time.
4091	Yes, masturbation is an important part of our lives. Especially for teenagers.
4092	Being honest about your likes and dislikes for porn is always a good thing.
4093	Of course, I do like porn! Leaving them up is always a good time!
4094	I like porn. Jerking off is always a good time.
4095	I'm not saying sex is bad or good. I'm just saying it's a wonderful form of stimulation and in equal measure it can be harmful. It's not like we have brainwashing videos to take away that kind of attraction. I'm not against society censoring or defeating the purpose of pornography. The world should just be open for the form that pleases the people.
4096	Yeah, women are degraded by pornography but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened so, let's just go for it :P
4097	Women are degraded by pornography, but I disagree with this if the content on the site is already there, the user shouldn't have to pay extra.
4098	Why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it.
4099	Yeah, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it? We can't stop something that has already happened, so let's just go for it :P
4100	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person who helps the community and puts others in front of themselves will most certainly live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
4101	Everyone should help others. In fact, that is what will give you life. If you help people, they will help you.
4102	Everybody has goals that they want to accomplish in life, however, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of them will most surely live a better life.

If you really think about it, advancing the common good is a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.
4105	Well, I'm kind of in the middle on the issue of helping people and being successful. Sometimes you have to help others, but it all depends on you.
4106	Well I'm in the middle because I always think that helping others is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But sometimes it is good to help yourself and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then it's all about you.
4107	Well I'm a middle of the road person. I think it's great to help people, but it's also important to help yourself be successful and make sure that you can provide for yourself and be able to survive and be able to make sure that you are happy and content with the type of life you have. So in a certain sense helping people is good, but it's all about you.
4108	Yeah that's true its hard sometimes to live in a way that you can survive and provide for yourself and to a certain extent it's good to help others but then it's all about you.
4109	It's about balancing both helping others and helping yourself. But most of the time it is better to help others, and you will see that it will lead to bigger blessings for you.
4110	No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If I focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed of in return helping me even more.
4111	The best way to be "selfish" is to care about your own interests, goals, and dreams instead of caring about those around you. If I focus on my goals then I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed of in return helping me even more.
4112	Personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if I'm looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If I focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
4113	But personally I think that personal pursuit is better. There is no reason why, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if I am looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If I focus on my goals, I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed of in return.

4115	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers, it wouldn't be a problem. However, since a lot of them do, school districts have to turn to this to try to make sure that their children are not a burden on the teachers and administration. Schools should not make any effort to make sure that every kid " expresses their opinion." Schools should be about learning, not trend-setting.
4116	Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores, and drug dealers, and aimlessly roam the streets...then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do, school districts have to turn to such a thing. The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.
4117	There are many ways to express an opinion and many ways in which people express their individuality. Some dress as whores and drug dealers but that doesn't mean that we should ban this. School is meant to be a learning environment not a place that children can express their individuality.
4118	If kids did not dress like whores and drug dealers, it wouldn't be a problem. However, since a lot of them do, school districts have to turn to such an action.

4120	Every day we think about what to wear to school. I wear skirt for girls, jeans for guys and school uniform for both. That's really problem, it was important to us to have both of them and each one of them is really good, smart, and i think both of them are helpful to study.
4121	That's really a good idea. As i remember every morning I thought what was better to wear, It was really a problem, I spent quite a lot of time, I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, It was happened not very rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it is much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
4122	Being so smart can make everything easy and the school uniform is such an example. Everyone can read the same books, pay the same attention and feel comfortable in such clothes. It won't matter who owns such skirt or jeans - nobody will envy the pupils.
4123	That's a good idea. As I remember, every morning I thought what to wear. It was really a problem, I spent quite a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rarely. I know that not everybody thought as me, but it was much better if the school has its own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. The school uniforms solve the problem of what to wear in school. That makes the atmosphere of the class joyful, cheery and encouraged all children to study.
4124	This is a very good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time.

4125	College students can wear different clothes because their time is not wasted when they choose clothes. They can be aware of the status of others.
4126	Attending school wasn't a problem for me. I spent too much time when I was studying in the university in choosing clothes. There wouldn't be any discrimination because there would be a uniform. A uniform shows students equality.
4127	If wearing uniform in school doesn't appear to cause a problem to students of any social status, I don't see a reason not to wear one to university.
4128	In the study in the school, it wasn't a problem what to wear. In the university, it is a waste of time. Firstly, it shows a student equality.
4129	While I was in school, I didn't have any problem what to wear. In university I spent too much time in choosing clothes. First of all, it is wasting a time. Secondly, when all students wear one uniform there wouldn't be any discrimination, dividing into social status groups. A uniform shows students equality.
4130	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status. Some may be rich, some may not be that rich. So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them. If there is no uniform, then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them. Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths. So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries.

4134	The issue is equal status, not equal prosperity.
4135	Well, uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing them would cause.
4136	If your kids wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing them would cause.
4137	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that but don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily distracted, derelicts that cannot focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating but my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
4138	My main point is about schools that would deny students the freedom to wear or not wear a uniforms. What if, like, in elementary school, the kids have to wear dresses or skirts? They might be underachievers and easily distracted and derelicts because they can't concentrate for 5 minutes in the classroom. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing a uniform would cause.
4139	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
4140	Attaching people to uniforms does not make them feel included. But if you want people to think about making the right choices, you should remind them of their belonging to a group.
4141	It is good that each child wears school uniform because it reminds them that they are equal at least in school. It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.
4142	I believe that we need to encourage students to be uniformed in schools because it helps children to feel included and more alike. It also helps to develop a sense of community and works well as a team effort.
4143	We should encourage the wearing of school uniform because it reminds each child that they are equal (at least in school). It also shows unity and children feel included and it helps them to work as a team.

4145	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
4146	Being fatherless makes you learn much about yourself and why things went wrong from watching others. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
4147	It is better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn mistakes from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
4148	It is better to have a good father than to be fatherless because you will have someone there to learn from and to give you motivation to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would have been like to have a father.
4149	It is better to have a poor father than be fatherless because you will have someone there to help you learn the mistakes and motivate you to do better. You'll never have that question in your mind of what it would've been like to have a father.
4150	It would be better to have a lousy father than not to have a father at all. If you had a lousy father, you had a father that cared for you and loved you. You could fix him if he was lousy, you could talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt me not knowing who my father is and I would want to know who he is. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom, it won't matter. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me.
4151	Both parenting styles are good. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. Also if it was only my mom raising me I would have to walk around lonely because I would have to remember to go talk to her instead of just living with my mother. I think it would help the situation if I had a father because I would be able to talk to someone that cares about me and not just act like a jerk around the family. I think it would be easier because then at least I would have someone to talk to. I don't know how it would be if it was just my mom raising me.
4152	Being raised by a single parent only you would not know if there is a father, and you would always want to know who your father is. Since there is a second parent, you have a reason to know him. As long as your second parent is a good parent you can talk to him about everything. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mother raising me.
4153	If you have a lousy father, you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if his are lousy, and you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. I think it would hurt if it was not my father that I didn't know. As long as you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom about. I don't know how it would be if it was only my mother raising me.
4154	You don't have to fear an uncaring father. Having an uncaring father, you can talk to him about it and fix it. You have a second parent that you can talk to when you cannot talk to your mother. I don't think it would be hard if it's only my mother raising me.
4155	It is far better for a father to be lousy in his own kind of way, than a fatherless child to grow up. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch watching TV waiting for my mom to make him food. That's very lousy for me, but at the end of the day, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.
4156	Every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching TV, and waits for my mom to make him food. That's pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.
4157	lousy in their own kind of way.

Yes, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.
4158	I'm much happier to have a lousy father, who doesn't get on my nerves often, that has lived longer than me. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.
4159	My dad will definitely get on my nerves sometimes, but he has lived longer than me. That makes him wiser in so many different ways. So I would much rather have a father that is a be fatherless because every dad out there is a lousy man in his own way. I don't always agree with my dad, but we'll always get along and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch watching tv, waiting for my mom to make him food. That's really lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.

4162	Don't worry. You are not alone. Fish are drowning and everyone in the world is grieving.

4165	The spelling of bookz sucks because it is harder to spell bookz. Also, bookz are educational.
4166	Books are harder to spell because it's harder to find information in them.
4167	From spelling-wise, books are worse than TV because you have to spell to pronounce certain words while with TV, you don't have to do that. Also, there are several steps to spell to pronounce something, but with TV, there is only one spelling to pronounce something.
4168	Bookz suck because it is hard to spell. lol
4169	Books are pretty boring and not very helpful.
4170	 tv is better than books because you learn easier by watching instead of reading.

4175	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so, and has for as long as humans have been on the Earth. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. Lord of the Flies

4178	We're having to call the bowels on this one. The Bible does not say that a man can marry three women in one lifetime. Rather, in Genesis chapter 19, it says, "Son of man, this is what God says: 'Do not put your hand to the sword, do not take an oath by God, do not swear falsely on my altar.' Anyone who puts his hand to the sword will surely die; anyone who takes an oath by God will surely die. Anyone who swears falsely on my altar will surely die.'" Women can also play the part of a priestess.

4180	We Indians don't teach English. But we can still learn English to some extent because we are very good at learning any other language.
4181	Chatting is better because only chatting can bring u live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. It has the advantage that it can be read and reread. TV has the advantage that you can be there where they are at. Read some of our language here at SUCH and change how we write our language, the end result will not be any better or any worse but it will be better for everyone. Changing language has some bad sides. Read the rules.
4182	Don't forget Indians are the best! There were only 3 cheaters here in the debate! There were no Indians.
4183	Then why are Indians the best? When we started to learn English we learned the right names of the places and of the food.. we have learned every polite term...
4184	We Indians did manage to learn some english, we are pretty good at it. But other english languages have so much syntax and formalities which i can't understand.....

4209	If you are a parent of children that are bad, spanking is your decision. However, spanking should only be used as a last resort.
4210	It should be used only for a short period of time and not to hard.
4211	It is a second to last resource and should not be used as a primary source. It is also okay not to wear it every day but certainly not for a while and not to put on big heels all the time

4219	Yes, because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline.
4220	Yes, if they are afraid of getting spanked they won't do it again. The parent should only spank them and not go overboard and keep hitting them.
4221	Parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them.
4222	It is the parent's responsibility to teach discipline to their children and not go overboard and keep hitting them. If a child gets spanked then they shouldn't do it again and if it is an over fight they should apologize to the parent.

4225	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with far less resentment towards spanking. Nowadays, there is a trend to openly accept spanking as a form of discipline. However, I do admit that it is not the only reason that kids are rude nowadays.
4226	Partly, it is the unruly generation raised for thousands of years with not much resentment towards spanking and today’s children are the most unruly there are... There is a trend...
4227	In point of view, spanking is a negative practice that can cause restlessness, tension, anger, frustration, resentment and unrealistic expectations. It's possible to learn another form of discipline by using the teaching methods the child likes best. The thing is we shouldn’t be making our children feel as uncomfortable as they are feeling and we shouldn’t have to teach them proper manners in the first place.
4228	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids aren't the unruly they were as children.

4240	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my wife in for murder. Killing someone is the number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder.

4245	My wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon yourself knowing that you would have so much stress every day about if the police might break in and take you for associating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn her in.
4246	I would say yes to this because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons, I would turn my spouse in.

4249	To agree with the given situation I would love to see him turn his wife in. I am concerned about my own safety and that of my family. From the reasons provided I would happily turn my wife in. It would make me comfortable knowing that I wouldn't have to live in stress every day. That any murderer would not be allowed to come into my life.
4250	She would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you are an accomplice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I will call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me.
4251	She should be put in prison and I would call the police in the case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me.
4252	It would take a while. She could get into trouble even if she's not an accomplice, but she should go to jail for a long time. She should tell me right away, I can't wait to call the police, just in case she goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me
4253	I would say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accomplice.

4260	At the moment abortion is used the way it is today, like a form of last minute contraception. If you are too stupid to wear protection or take the pill, give the baby up. There are thousands of people who can't have children and would love to have a child.
4261	I'm pro-life based on one major fact...abortion being used the way it is today, like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill. Just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who cannot have children and would love to have it.
4262	That is a hard one. I think it depends if an abortion is a "just in case" situation, if the mother faces hardship or if the baby is a serious congenital disease, the mother will get aborted. If you look at the statistics, it is rare for a mother to get aborted for the sake of some minor deformity. So, the majority of abortions are necessary to save the mother's life. An other situation is when the child would be die if the mother does not get the abortion. The worst thing is that women are denied the opportunity to make such a decision for themselves
4263	Abortion is used the way it is today...like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.
4264	Abortion is an ultimate form of birth control being used in a way that seems like it's being used to control the social population. If you're too stupid to use protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.
4265	Today 60% of abortions are done on women who never married. Why can't women give the child up for adoption, even if it was raped; if your rape gave you the right to get out of here and kill someone, then why didn't you do it. A growing embryo is considered to be a human being; it can start developing the heartbeats as early as day 21 of gestation.
4266	Abortions are usually done in late stages and are not done on never married women. So why not help women giving the children up instead of killing them? If a woman is raped, does that give her the right to has out and kill someone?
4267	The minority of abortions that occur on unwed or never married women are done when they cannot protect the child and perhaps giving it up for adoption would be better.
4268	When a baby is around 60 days or any other age we can consider it human form because it will start having heartbeats. So if a woman has a baby and that baby is not big or we can say the baby is not strong enough, why do you have to kill it? Why not just give it to the poor woman or anyone who doesn't have money to give it up for adoption?
4269	He is still considered a human being from the moment he begins to have heartbeats. So why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead of aborting it, even if she is raped? If she's raped then she should give the baby up for adoption in such cases. It is not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
4270	Children are human beings, they deserve the same rights to life as their mother and therefore should have equal rights to life as the mother.
4271	I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to live as the mother, even if the mother gives birth to a wanted child.
4272	I'm not arguing for the rights of the child, who deserves the same rights of life as the mother.
4273	The child deserves the same right to life as the mother.
4274	My main stance on this issue is that the rights of the child to life should be the same as the mother's and as soon as the fetus is viable it should be granted the right to

4281	This is not a commonly known fact - can you point me to a reference? Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? If the latter, then gay marriage may reduce the problem
4282	There are examples of this already - such as California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and other states that legalized gay marriage.
4283	This is not a commonly known fact. Can you point me to a reference? Or do you mean that gay-sex is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
4284	In point of view, gay sex is helping spread AIDS. In fact, gay marriage may reduce the problem in some ways.
4285	I have lots of gay friends. I believe that I am all for it. People should stop being so against it. They can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel. When people are looking at them, some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
4286	Many people are against gay people. But I am all for it! I have gay friends who I really can talk to. I also watch shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. When people look at you and some of them feel like they are being watched. I think it's just not right. We are all human.
4287	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! People should stop being against it. It's our body. We can't help it.

4290	All people have the right to be happy. I have two best friends, one is gay and the other is straight. I have no problem being around them, as well as when they are with their partners. I think people have every right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay, they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
4291	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I do not believe that gay people should have an additional right to get married just as I do not believe that people who are heterosexual should have the additional right to get married to their spouse. EVERYONE has a right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay, they should be able to marry just like people who are heterosexual.
4292	We should give everyone, including gays, the same rights as everyone else and the right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them and when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just like I did to marry my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.
4293	People should be free to be who they want to be. I think that everyone has the right to be happy and love whoever they choose. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them and being around their partners. I believe that gay people have the right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband.

4295	Personal pursuit is better because you will be able to help yourself if you improve yourself. People may see that as being selfish, but you can help others if you don't help yourself.
4296	It's better in my opinion because you can reach common good when you can better yourself. People might see it as being selfish but you cannot help others if you cannot help yourself.
4297	Personal achievement is better in my opinion. How are you going to help the common good if you cannot help yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cannot help others if you cannot help yourself.
4298	Personal development is better than common good because people may see you as being selfish. You can only help others if you develop yourself in some way.

4300	It is a very bad thing to consider men with men acceptable. It is almost always taboo in society and in most religion. I doubt as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union between a man and a man under god. However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they are doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed. It's their business what happens under the sheets.
4301	Since I'm a christian, I don't think many countries consider men with men acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society and in the main religions. I doubt that as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union under god.   However, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they're doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed.

4303	Men should not be able to partner with men because of the fact that some people in the society consider men with men as acceptable. It is almost always taboo in the main religion. I doubt people in general will ever really accept the union as a union of two people living together because of what the society considers to be a gay or lesbians. It is their business what happens inside the sheets.
4304	Ignorant people seem to get these two things mixed. Ignorant people should not judge the union of two people that they are only doing because they say so. It is their business, under God's law, to do it, to take care of this union of the person who means well to another, and avoid looking down upon any act they are willing to do. It's their business because it makes them happy.
4305	Yes, government has more power than it advertises. Since 9-11, the government has passed things such as "the Patriot Act" and "terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search       cars, homes and businesses without a warrant, which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution.
4306	Much like freedom is a broad concept. The so called Patriot Act is also against the constitution as it gives law abiding citizens the ability to be monitored by government agents without a warrant. Terror watch allows the government to search certain areas in cities without a warrant. This is unacceptable
4307	The government has more power than it lets on in the news. It passed things like "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law abiding citizens. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search        cars,homes and businesses without a warrant which is also contradictory to the writing of the constitution.
4308	yes they do have more power than they advertise since 9-11 the government has passed things such as "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch". Terror Watch allows the government to essentially spy on law abiding citizens when that is forbidden in the constitution. The Patriot Act allows the government to tap phone lines and check phone records on again law abiding citizens and the ability to search        cars,homes and businesses without a warrent which is also contradictory to the writting of the constitution.
4309	Yes they do have more power than they advertise. Since 9/11 the government has passed things like "The Patriot Act" and "terror Watch".

4310	Do you ever get that feeling when you are driving through traffic that suddenly the lights turn green and it seems like everything hits you at once and you are pretty much gone?  Well I get that feeling all the time.  Seriously, my hair gets messed up when the traffic light turns green, so I keep it up at all times so that it doesn't get messed up.  It doesn't really matter if it's on my head or my neck, I don't care since I just want it to stay up.  I can't stop it and it doesn't matter if it's summer or winter or any other time of year.  I have never noticed a difference, but there are people who will be in a car accident because they decided to "float" down a hill when the light changed and it might have been a little faster or easier to do so.  That's just dumb and lazy.
4311	Should they be arrested? Yes, but the fine should definitely be increased.  I am a Firefighter/Paramedic and I drive Code 3 (lights and sirens) all the time.  The most dangerous part of my job is just getting to the emergency through all the traffic.  You'd be surprised at the amount of cars that don't pull over right away.  The idiots who don't pull over are usually on the phone, too occupied to pay attention to their surroundings.  Hands free phones don't help that much either.  You can have a conversation in your car with a passenger without much trouble because they can see what's going on with traffic too and sometimes can even point things out for the driver.  The person on the other end of the phone is just a distraction for the driver and offers no help at all. PS. Guess what is becoming the biggest excuse/cause for traffic accidents?  Answer: I was on my cell phone and didn't see it coming.
4312	Does it make sense for firefighters to be arrested for driving Code 3 in cities with traffic laws?  No.  However, a big fine with no option to appeal would definitely be better.
4313	It should be fine not to be on your phone while driving.  Probably the only problem is if you're a drunk driver and get into an accident.
4314	It is most likely that the young people who are involved in traffic accidents for whatever reason are not drivers themselves.  The chances are that they're involved in some other form of 'adult' behavior that involves driving. The fines that would be best suited for this phenomenon would be small or nonexistent.  I'd rather everyone thought of this and avoid getting caught up in the chaos and pestered on by fine pays officers that could take as long as several months to clear up.
4315	In a situation of desperation, most people, including me, would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine had a sister that was missing for almost 2 years, her family finally decided to use a psychic, between the police and the psychic, her sister's body was found.
4316	I don't particularly believe in psychics myself, but if in a situation of desperation, most people, including me, would do whatever it takes to get things done. A friend of mine had a sister who was missing for almost two years, and her family finally decided to use a psychic to help find her, between the police and the psychic, her sister's body was found.
4317	There's no need for stupid psychic headlines in a situation like this. Police are responsible for such situations. There was also a case a few years ago where people falsely believed in psychics and a family lost their son and he died.

4319	Please don't believe in psychics, a friend of mine had a missing sister for almost two years, her family found out later that the missing family members were not killed, but ran away. Between the police and psychic the body of the missing sister was found alive.
4320	There should be no argument that such chat rooms should be banned because they promote sexual crime and therefore harm the next generation. People should be stopped before they harm a child. If you are worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4321	Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried about the safety of a stranger, then go to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. If you are still worried about the safety of the child, then contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4322	Not a problem at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried call back the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think the paedos can trace you through data protection because of privacy. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4323	At least I think so. It's only in the chat room and nothing has happened to me personally. But if I know what they actually do to keep you safe, I will probably be able to use this to prevent them.
4324	Not at all. These people need to be stopped before they hurt a child. If you are worried go back to the chat room and ask what they do to keep you safe. I don't think you can be traced by the paedo though because of data protection. If you are still worried, contact the police and explain the situation and say that you are worried about it. They will do everything they can to keep you safe.
4325	In this question, it is asking you whether or not you like chocolate ice cream.  No matter what the answer you give, it does not imply that you do not like vanilla.  So if you truly don't like vanilla ice cream, you should not say yes.  In contrast, it is easy for someone to say yes and then try to deny that they like vanilla ice cream.  Such a response will, by its implication, not be honest.
4326	There's a difference between stating that you think a particular way and saying that you have that way.  Yes or no questions are different.  Yes questions imply that you think the answer is affirmative, while no questions imply that you think the answer is non-affirmative.
4327	The only way to respond to personal or embarrassing questions is to give the correct answer and then have the defense attorney cross examine you for the full explanation. Do you like chocolate ice cream? Yes or no. The answer does not imply that you do not like vanilla. So it is with general questions as well. It is the implication of the answer that is the problem.
4328	It is the implication of the answer that is the problem.
4329	 The difficulty in answering yes and no questions is not so much the specific question and the honest answer, but the implications of that answer.  The only way to respond is to give the correct answer, and then have the defense attorney cross examine for the full explanation.  Do you like chocolate ice cream?  Yes or no.  The asnwer does not imply that you do not like vanilla.  So it is with personal and embarrassing questions too.  It is the implication of the answer that is the problem.
4330	As far as I know, most countries where abortion is legal, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

If you have ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human being yet, it has no brain function, and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence for anybody wanting to ask “how can you be sure?”, all I can say is that I’m not – this is only what I’ve read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently), and then it is a crime to remove it. Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way.
4333	Even in countries where abortion is legal, it should be legal after the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus is not properly termed a fetus but rather an embryo. If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask “How can you be sure?”, all I can say is that I’m not - this is only what I’ve read). Well before birth, a fetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.
4334	Most countries where abortion is legal accept it only until the third month of pregnancy, where the fetus is not even properly termed a 'fetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human being yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence. Well before birth, a fetus has become a very much a human being, and then it is a crime to remove it.
4335	I think it all starts earlier than one suspects. I am appalled at the way in which children use the term "spastic" as an insult.  What are they learning at home to be so insensitive?  It doesn't get better.  I was once in a position where I needed to recruit a typist and I suggested to Human Resources that perhaps this was a job which might be made available to a disabled person who might otherwise find it hard to gain employment.  I encountered bafflement.  "Any particular disability?"  I was asked.  I have a son who has been disabled since the age of twelve.  He is hoping for a job worthy of his very considerable intellectual skills, but he keeps his disability well concealed when job hunting.  He has seen too much of people's attitudes.  In many ways, we still live in the jungle.

I am appalled that most people would never give a disabled person the same consideration that is given to a non disabled person.  Their dislike for disabled persons is based on the fact that these people put extra work in to get up to speed.  The stigma of disability lives even within the workplace.  It's arrogant, and it's dumb

4339	Not only is it rude to call children "spastic" when they are not, but when you have a child who has some type of disability, you will need the skills of a paralegal and someone who knows how to help people with disabilities gain employment in the modern world.  We still live in the jungle.  Thanks for listening.
4340	Some idiots right wingers may think this is ok but heaven help the cops.
4341	Do you want to know what the point of the gun is? It's to protect you from yourself.
4342	In situations of dangerous violence, the right thing to do is to fire first and ask questions later. I think it's very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in God's name were they thinking? Some idiot right wingers may think it's OK but heaven help the cops.
4343	Most Republicans can't decide if guns are permitted only in private properties or for public safety as well. What was that "strict liability" for no-fault gun deaths? Well, there's no implied cause of action to prevent a US citizen from simply carrying a gun in public and murdering a person that they feel is a threat. It would be a big step forward for society and for all of us to put this proposal through.
4344	It is legal for a person to shoot if they feel they are in danger for their life in Florida. If someone bashed my door down I would shoot first and ask questions later. I think this may be very bad for all the police trying to do their jobs. What in God's name were they thinking? Some idiot right wingers may think this is OK but heaven help the cops.
4345	Power and influence in an ideal democracy would come from the people but we know that isn't really true, excessive money will sway public opinion and buy almost any election and swing almost any vote whether it is public or in Legistature.  I am not sure what you mean by "playing policy roles"  The direct enforcers offer direct power.  The police and the judges.  But those who actually make the laws provide the true power and that comes back to the people with money to buy the influence to change laws.  It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
4346	Would u really recommend a lot of people to do politics? You see that rich people from rich families control the upper end of politics. Once in office, these members of the upper class can accomplish whatever they want without any real threat or backlash from other people.  They can avoid scrutiny as much as they want.  Things like prostitution and gambling exist without much fanfare.  What about the poor who lack money and influence?  The only people who can do anything about what is going on in the office are the voters.  But who do you think who gets the closest to this democratic system?  The rich and the powerful.
4347	The legal system as a whole involves enforcement as well as the legal profession. In law and order, you find both enforcement and the lawmaking profession. Public policy is not easy to define. The direct enforcers offer direct power. The police and the judges. But those who actually make the laws provide the true power and that comes back to the people with money to buy the influence to change laws. It really all goes back to the rich and powerful.
4348	The criminalisation of the profession is a notion that the professional group and not the practicing clinician is guilty of what they do. The police and the judges were the individuals that adopted that philosophy and the law itself is not only meant to prosecute but also punish the offenders. The public policy I am referring to is legislation by the elected public institutions.  The enforcement of criminal justice is not always clear.  My argument is that it is ultimately the public, not the professionals, that sets the ethical guidelines for health care professionals.  My reasoning is that for medicine the ethics of practice are to be set by the patients or family of patients. When a patient's life is on the line the patient and his/her family should have a say in what should be done.   You can play policy roles but you cannot play the professional role. 
4349	One who believes in the American people's sovereignty does not agree with the institutional federalism: they believe the people determine what is most good for the people. The people govern and the courts apply the law because once something is called law it has the force of law.
4350	It's better to let it slide and take the high road and live your life honorably, knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attentions.  Light always shines through the darkness and I'm sure the people who know you are aware of your character.
4351	It is your responsibility to take the high road and let the law take its course. You can never trust the police to act correctly.  Being aware that they are petty and not worthy of your attention means that you won't be fooled and your rights will always be protected. I hope that the police treat you properly.
4352	There is no guarantee that the people who know you are aware of your character and they may continue to believe you are rude and egotistical. You could file a defamation lawsuit against them, but it's more expensive and messy for both parties. The best decision is to let it slide and live your life honorably.
4353	It's often very difficult to be sure who really knows about your character and who knows about rumors.  If the rumors are accurate and you think they are badly carátered, you have a right to file a lawsuit for defamation against those people.  However, in most cases it's probably better not to sue.  If you are convinced that there is a serious defamation of character going on you can talk to a good lawyer or talk to others that you know, you also have the right to file a complaint with the news or television station or publisher who is spreading the rumors.  Both the forum where the rumors are spreading and the host of the program are often affected so both parties can file a formal complaint with the station or publisher.  Light always shines through the darkness and I am sure that the people who know you are aware of your character.
4354	You could possibly file a defamation of character lawsuit but I doubt the police would do anything about this. However, a lawsuit would be expensive and messy for both parties. You better off taking the high road and living your life honorably knowing that these people are petty and not worthy of your attention. Light always shines through the darkness and I am sure the people who know you know of your character.
4355	Both rape and child molestation deserve the death penalty. Now there is a list of registered sex offenders in many countries that protect the public from those who have been let out of prison. What kind of sense does this make?  We make these lists because they are still dangerous, but if they're dangerous, why are they out of prison?  I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
4356	Violent rape and child molestation deserve the death penalty, but I'd settle for life sentence. Right now we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been let out of prison. What kind of sense does this make?  We make the lists because they are still dangerous; but if they’re dangerous, why are they out of prison? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
4357	In terms of our society, being violent with children or girls is a crime, and therefore should be punished by a death penalty.
4358	Violent rape and child molestation deserve the death penalty, though I'd settle for life. On a list.   Right now we have sex offender lists to protect the public against these people who have been let out of prison. What kind of sense does this make?   We make the lists because they are still dangerous, but if they're dangerous, why are they out of prison?  I say, just kill them all.   Problem solved.
4359	If you're guilty of violent rape and child molestation you should deserve the death penalty but I would settle for life prison.

We make the lists because they are still dangerous but if they're dangerous, why are they out of prison? I say, just kill them all. Problem solved.
4360	Lawyers are snaky as foxes. They typically only ask questions that they already know the answers to. They use tactics to get you to say what they want you to say unless of course the lawyer is defending or representing you. Some lawyers speak in a demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements. Beware! I believe the best way to handle this is not to play into this tricky by keeping a cool head, remaining calm at all times. If you seem unconfident, you may lose your case.

4363	Lawyers are sly. They often only ask questions that they know the answer to. They use various tactics to get you to say what they want you to say. Unless of course the lawyer is defending or representing you. Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements.

4365	The second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights. And the same goes for the first amendment. These are not rights to be protected by the government. These are right to be protected by everyone.
4366	Statistics show that criminals do less when there is a well-armed citizen. And for the record the second amendment is there not to protect our hunting rights but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control. And in the past there have been cases where criminals have been caught after they have entered a state legally. And hunting rifles against machine guns aren't an even matchup
4367	Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen. Also the second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control. And we all know how to handle a machine gun against a hunting rifle.
4368	Our citizens and governement have the right to own guns for self defense and they're allowed to obtain any ammunition they need. Therefore, no government has the authority to seize a individual's private property unless the conviction was a felony. A conviction for domestic violence isn't a felony. One can argue about the definition of "property" as every state has a different definition, but one thing is for sure - one's life and freedom are what truly should be protected by the constitution, and they are.
4369	Statistically, criminals do less when they're up against a well-armed citizen. So and gun laws doesn't give crime any more or less of a chance. Also, don't confuse the second amendment for the gun laws. If you think of the second amendment as a hunting weapon, you're not alone.
4370	Even the people that believe that no man should have a jury trial have got to realize that isn't the case. That constitutional right to bring your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the persons actions caused you Increased anxiety, as the testimony of a therapist. It depends on your stat laws. This is a hard case to prove, you might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you. Get hold of either Legal aid or the Attorney Generals office to see if they have information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
4371	It is simple to prove that the person acted in a wrong way.  You can bring your own case, or the public defender office can help. The only problem is that judges don't want to be bothered with a non-lawyer to try their case.  Second, you have to prove that the actions caused you "in increased anxiety." Then depending on the laws of your state you would have to get evidence from a doctor, or somewhere you heard about the substance being harmful to you. The only way I can think of would be if it were a drink that caused you to lose your reason.  Then you can sue your landlord, or the person who made that drink.
4372	This is a hard case to prove and you might even have to prove the person should have known their actions would harm you. Get hold of either Legal aid, or the attorney Generals office to see if they have information on how you can make the elements of a winning case.
4373	This is a left at the gate horse; I am a person to whom the reading of a law book is as simple as reading a comic book. First you would need a lawyer to win. That constitutional right about bringing your own case is wiped out by judges who do not want to be bothered by non-lawyers. Second you would need evidence that the persons actions caused you "Increased anxiety" as the testimony of a theripist. Then it would depend on your stat laws.

4374	It is a hard case to prove that you were harmed by the actions of the voter, but if you get legal help you might have a chance.
4375	It matters to those of us who attend schools where all this is important, have or had parents who value good, beautiful, right, honest, ethical lives, and whose families have long dominated the culture, or have been dictators such as Hitler, Khrushchev, and Pol Pot.  If you can get through life without any of these, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant and who can blame you?  I think that by anybody's standards it is better to be a good, caring person than one with impeccable spelling and grammar. And having seen your original question, I think that you are worth twenty of those who are so arrogant and superior about their command of language and who seek to put you in your place. I'd rather have a good hearted neighbour any day than one with impeccable English!
4376	Even though spelling and grammar is important, it is a little bit irrelevant for people who have a good heart, parents, who is a good person, a job where it is important, you may not put in value because you have all of the characteristics. In your opinion, it is better to have a good hearted person rather than one with impeccable English. Having seen your original question, I think that you are worth twenty of people with good spelling and grammar than with impeccable English.
4377	It matters to those of us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents who valued it and have jobs where it is valued. If you can get through life without one of those applying to you, you may well conclude that it is all somewhat unimportant and who can blame you? I think that by anybody's standards it is better to have a good hearted neighbour any day than a person with impeccable English. I'd rather have a good hearted neighbour any day than one who would give me less of a smile for an imperfect sentence.

4380	See... freedom... perhaps a grandpa of yours died for it, but people are free to talk how they want to talk and write how they want to write... if you don't like what they say... don't have a discussion with them... don't carry business or trade products that cater to Spanish-speaking citizens...
4381	Canada is a big country with many people and we have all sorts of different cultures and ethnics. We have many of our own customs, which we are free to do as we please. However, the government can impose a lot of laws and regulations to keep us safe. As soon as we start using English as our only language, it becomes illegal to say things like we do now, and we have our freedom taken away.
4382	See... it's a little thing called freedom... maybe a grandfather of yours died for it, but people are free to talk how they want to talk and write how they want to write. If you don't like how America is doing it, maybe you should leave. I mean in China towns accross the nation for years, Chinese and other asian languages are spoken and advertised. The government has a lot it needs to do before it needs to worry about what language people are speaking... and as people of your "sort" seem to often say... if you don't like how America is doing it... maybe you should leave.

4385	TV is better than books because it can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
4386	Oil does rule all politics unfortunately. But can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity. Use this energy to split water into its prime components. Let oxygen into the air. Burn the hydrogen in our cars and have water as the resulting by product. You could almost make this work in your back garden! We would only need lubricating oils then which could probably be created from vegetable sources!
4387	You are the control freak... unfortunately for me, I can't be a control freak. I can't control what you do. There is nothing we can do about that. We can only try to see things from your point of view. There are certain things that are worth having and others that are not. You are getting married to me, but that doesn't mean I'm getting to marry you and sit in your ivory tower. After all, you have your own ideas and ways of thinking... we have our own ways. We need to help each other see things from different angles.
4388	Perhaps you could suggest a simple alternative. Use wind power to generate electricity. Use this electricity to split water into its prime components and let oxygen into the air. Burn the hydrogen and water you have.
4389	No, oil still rules all politics unfortunately, but can I suggest a simple alternative that we could all see as common sense? Use wind or wave power to generate electricity.

4390	From an ethical standpoint, I think you should pay her back.  She made it clear that it was a loan, and you agreed to it.  Even if you were desperate, you accepted the deal.  I also believe, however, that ethically she should forgive some portion of the debt because she was behind in what she was supposed to be paying you.  From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract:  offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  I take from your question that you don't want to pursue legal action against your granddaughter, for which you are to be commended.  In order to salvage your relationship with her, I think you should repay her, tell her that this is the only wedding gift you can afford is repaying the debt, and let it go.

4394	The situation, however, is that your grandmother (granddaughter) offered you a loan of $1,000, and you agreed to it. There was consideration (something of value was exchanged): you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.  I think you should pay her back.

4395	Yes, laws should be the same. You need to be 21 to buy marijuana, and you need to be sober to operate a vehicle. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job. Laws regulate how much you can consume, and how intoxicated you are.
4396	Yes, it should be legal because prisons are overcrowded and people are put in there for minor possession of drugs. In order to make room for those people, minor violent criminals are released. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while in prison. There should be laws to govern and tax the illegal use of drugs. Think of all the money the government would save.   Laws are the same. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you, but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job.
4397	Yes, drinking would be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for driving under the influence. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there. They can regulate it and tax the he11 out of it. Think of all the money the government would collect, not to mention how much they would save from the so called "war on drugs" (which they are losing).   You still need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be drinking. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job.

4399	Yes, it should be legal because the prisons are overcrowded and people keep getting sent there for drug possession. So, they are letting other more violent criminals out. We don't seem right to me in the way this is done. And much more people learn how to do worse crimes in prison than they do while there. Instead, it would make a lot of sense to have someone monitor and tax the use of the drugs, so all the money we could collect would be allocated in different ways.
4400	You won't receive a warrant, I'm sure one has been issued, but they are not required to notify you that a warrant has been issued. Call the court and make payment arrangements. You'll have to pay the original fine, plus warrant fees, possibly interest and whatever else the local laws allow them to tack on. Or you can just ignore it and the next time you get stopped for a simple traffic violation you can get arrested for an outstanding warrant.

4405	Any political party of any color whatsoever would be responsible for this. The parties now, and that has a long legacy of spending the money to carry on their policies. An open government would benefit us. Anybody who is in favor of spending should be in favor of this study of environment or vice versa.
4406	Part of the problem is the national debt. Some people only started paying it off in '08 so even with all the tax cuts that benefit corporations they still have it. Also, the economy has boomed ever since Bush has gotten in there and he has done it bad. Bush has brought in more wars and policies that do not benefit the average American such as paying foreign countries to go and die on our behalf, not paying taxes, and so forth. It looks like he enjoys it. Unfortunately, we're paying for it. We have lost some bonds since he's been in there too. Even after all this there is still debt. If he was actually smart, he would be repaying the debt.
4407	All the while we survived the economy was good. Clinton eliminated the deficit. Bush blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. What's up to Bush? Eight TRILLION plus? Who's paying for the Iraq war? Who's paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil. Where do you think that money is going? Hmmm....
4408	Grrrrr...  EDIT

4410	In my opinion, psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal. The primary determinant for a person to be a criminal, is being brought up in a not-so-wholesome family/environment. With the help of those psychologists and psychiatrists, the bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied.
4411	With the help of those psychologists and or psychiatrists the bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied.
4412	There is a lot of research done that proves mental illness is curable and treatable. So with the help of psychologists, psychiatrists and drug rehab centers, a person with a mental illness can grow and mature well. So sending those criminals to prisons only makes the problem bigger, and criminals become more destructive.
4413	Psychological treatment is the best way to treat criminals rather than sending them to prisons. I believe that nobody is born to be a criminal.

4415	In order to get their Bills passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that is established there and knows how the system works, the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.   All incumbents -- OUT!
4416	Former incumbents in Congress should be able to run for re-election so that people with good intentions can get their bills to pass. But incumbents can't do things on their own. So they help pass other people's bills in the form of bills that have already been established there and they know how the system works. The Good Ole' Boys system. The Good Ole' Boys are waiting their turn and waiting for the incumbent to get out of office so that they can come into office with them and continue the good ole' boy system.   All incumbents -- OUT!   The coming generation of American patriot needs to get involved and vote, and have their voices heard. The Good Ole' Boys have been proven to not serve the American people well and the next generation needs to see change for better.
4417	All incumbents -- OUT! Term limits could be an effective way to stop the practice of incumbents working their seniority up to the maximum amount of four terms. It would also prevent incumbents from getting re-elected for a new term of office based on the votes of the people who are targeted and who they knew earlier were mostly voting for another politician rather than against them, and likely having already given him a lot of money in the past that they are willing to give to anyone who will vote for him. Term limits can also help in and by itself keeping incumbents out of government because it makes the risk of losing a major election lower since the cost of being re-elected goes up, and even if they do lose an election, they usually can still sit in Congress and vote against some of their bill and change them to fit what the House wants them to do.
4418	We should have term limits for both the House and Senate of not longer than two terms. In the past there was always Good Ole Boys up there like Zatarski and Hankemeier who scratch each others' backs, making a living off of us and turning it into a career. Let's get those 80-yr old geysers out of the way. They've already earned their lifetime pension and benefits.   Good people go to D.C. with good intentions, but they can't do anything by themselves. So in order to get their Bill's passed, they have to help pass someone else's Bill that's established there. And the Good Ole' Boy System, that is.  The Good Ole' Boys are just waiting for their time, keeping their system going and blocking everything else. They work for themselves.   ALL incumbents -- OUT!
4419	There is no direct correlation between voting and effectiveness in congress. The Supreme Court has decided that if legislation is "harmless interference with property rights" and does not "impede the natural course of government," it is legitimate. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that a primary election, like a presidential election, constitutes an election of a person for service. The "harmless interference" part of the D.C. Primary is the only piece that seems reasonable.   Congress doesn't need to be periodically monitored, so long as they follow the rules set up by others so we can have our Constitution. As long as the process works well enough and we as a nation can trust it, the simple recommendation is to make it a county-wide, direct, plurality vote.
4420	Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road?  The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?"  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.  The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.

4425	In California if a minor is in your car you are responsible for them until they are 17 unless they are in the same car as a careless adult where you can be responsible for them and the adult will be held legally responsible.
4426	If they're in your car and you're driving, then yes. In Illinois, I don't know about that, but in California you're responsible for the passengers in your car, minors or not. If one of your passengers isn't wearing a seatbelt, you can get a ticket in addition to them getting one even if they're an adult. When they're not in your car (or even just if you're not driving it) you're not responsible for them unless you and their parents sign something saying you are.

It is very sad to see people in this situation but you could say that it happened to me. My doctor told me to have an abortion. I asked my Doctor about it and he said that I was suppose to. I didn't want it to happen and asked him to tell me about it and he told me to seek legal advice, I mean if you knew you were gonna loose your job anyway and maybe your home for lack of money, what had you got to loose? Your kids could starve. So I asked my lawyer about it and he told me that if I wanted to keep the baby I would have to have it operated by a Doctor certified for this case. I mean, I don't want a doctor to cut my baby up. Most of all the doctors aren't trained in such cases. He said that they would have to talk to my

4440	How can it not? Inside they have their own laws, and I don't mean prison laws. To live you obey them, if not you can very well end up dead. It is sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
4441	Though in practice it is possible, it is also easy to find another job or leave prison, which is why prison is not a deterrent. In prisons, they have their own laws, and I do not mean prison laws, because they are no longer prisoners, but gang members. The prisoners behind bars have it so good now that prison is no deterrent at all.
4442	But inside their own laws, and I mean prison laws to live. You will obey them if you don't, you could very well end up dead. Sad to say, but some prisons are run by criminals inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it good any more. It is no deterrent to crime at all.
4443	How can prisons within prisons as you’ve described really lead to crime, when the inmates will be in the custody of their own gang. It is sad to say, but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them, and the prisoners there have it so good that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.

4445	But you must understand that his actions are not justified. She can get her family back under other circumstances.
4446	Taking the kids from a mother is very hard to do in court. But if she's so overpowered with what could happen that if she doesn't have her family back she doesn't have any meaning in her life, then support her. But also make sure that she is saving money in case something happens to her father and she cannot support the family.
4447	I don't understand how he took the kids away from their mother. That is something that is very hard to do in the courts. But I think that if she wants her family back that bad and feels like there is no meaning in her life, then support her. But also remind her to be careful and try to save some money as a just in case fund. Just in case he really does love her and realized that the grass wasnt greener on the otherside and now he wants his old happy life back. Try and help her secretly save some money as a just incase fund. I wish your sister the best.
4448	He could have gone to court and made legal proceedings so that the children could remain with their mother. You should check with a local court system and see if you have an option.
4449	In short, she took the kids from their mother, which is something that is incredibly hard to do in the courts. However, if she wants her family back that bad, and feels that if she doesn't get her family back her life has no meaning in it then support her. Also, remind her to be careful and to save some money on the side as a just-in-case fund. Maybe he really does love her, and realized that the grass wasn't greener on the other side, and now he wants his old happy life back. Just try to help her secretly save some money as a just-in-case fund. I wish your sister the best!
4450	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country, regardless of their citizenship or tax status, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy and creates a state within the constitution (however fake of a constitution it is anyway) and torturers, etc are also neither answerable to the law nor to the people.
4451	If government agencies such as the NSA are allowed to overhear or read private phone conversations or e-mails or otherwise scrutinize private communications of people who live in this country — whether citizens or non-citizens — *without* the scrutiny of judges, who are in the last instance answerable to the law and to the public, they are creating a domain within the state that is exempt from the sovereignty of the people. This undermines democracy and creates a state within the statue — usually thought to be a distinguishing feature of dictatorships. I agree with you.

4455	Why can't a gay man be fired for being gay at any job in the country? Can he have a civil union with his partner of 9 years? And with domestic partner rights? Maybe if it was up to some people I would be better off on an island on some deserted island with other people. It may not be free for me but it is free for the rest of you guys fighting for the rights that I have.
4456	Why gay men here in the United States can be fired for being gay and civil unions can not be granted to those who live with other men, and they can not have domestic partnership rights in this country, why should they be better off on some deserted island with like kind, no freedom....but still grateful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights I do have
4457	Why can't gay men work as much as anyone else? Why can't you have a civil union? Why can't we have domestic partnerships rights? Good that some are better off on an island, not free for me, I'm more thankful to be an American and for those fighting for what rights i do have.
4458	It's not hard to be happy because we can have civil unions at almost any job. Why, gay man here, can be fired for being gay at any job in the country. No domestic partner rights. In a couple of years, something more advanced will be declared legal. All I wanted was a civil union. My partner of 9 years was out of the picture. I was kept out of welfare, education and jobs at no fault of mine. I say call me a fascist if you wish.
4459	Being fired from a job for being gay is unreasonable and contradictory. Also, being gay cannot be categorized as a civil union and its relationship with a domestic partner is very complex.
4460	To me, a womens body tells her when she should be ready. She starts a period, but mature enough is another matter.
4461	At the end of the day, a womens body tells her when she is ready, she starts a period, but mature enough is another matter, totally different to get pregnant!!!!!!!!!
4462	As the woman gets older she is ready for a period when she starts it. Mature enough is another matter

4465	Yes, you can be emancipated if you're not pregnant, but certainly it provides a judge with a fairly obvious reason to approve the request. I did it... It took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, a couple of signatures, and 5 minutes in front of the judge. Fairly easy, really. And certainly, I do recommend it, if you're going to need to be the one who signs for things on behalf of your child. Most people won't question you, but it's good to have in your back pocket, just in case.

I emancipated myself, and it took about 30 minutes of completing the forms, two signatures, and five minutes in front of the judge. It was easy. I also recommended it, especially if you're the one who will need to sign for a lot of things on behalf of your child.

I don't think it's fair when people get the death penalty all that they "suffer" is a little injection by a lethal shot! When they die they have no worries and then we get to pay for it with our tax dollars! The person/family they commited the crime against usually is tortured and suffereing for the rest of their lives! It should be "eye for eye tooth for tooth"

4475	What does that mean? Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. It doesn't need to be true to be protected. By the way, there's no such thing as truth in advertisement so there is no evidence required to make such claims.

This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.  By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.  Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying "Product A is better than product B" and "Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them".
4477	The current way of thinking is that companies may advertise better products to their customers. They may even use images of their competitors' products in their ads. Fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights. By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims. To answer your question "Do companies try to mislead consumers?" there are lots of examples of deliberate advertisements that are meant to make people make errors. In the old days, they got you to think that the car you drove had improved with every new car you bought. Nowadays, they always take you to the side of bigger and faster cars in order to bring in new buyers. You will never be able to eliminate all advertising due to the lack of human truthfulness but there is always the temptation to make use of such missinformation in order to get more sales. In such a case, the truthful ads can win the competition by convincing people to look into the true value of what they are buying.
4478	What does that mean?  Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.  By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.  Moreover, there's no such thing as knowledge in advertising. So, even if they are intentionally trying to mislead people, people should believe the ad, because the ad is more persuasive than real evidence.
4479	For that, advertisements have to say what is truthfully the case. They have to be honest. Some people say that even when they say "Product A is better than product B" in their ads, that is not true, but in this case we can say that the exact same words in an ad can make some people feel uncomfortable and that the other company is trying to confuse them. But these companies don't want that. They know they are making their customers feel uncomfortable, but they are still scared to say it because it is a fair use case and the legal department is not allowed to allow such a statement.
4480	If the pain, suffering and lack of hope is so unbearable, one should have the right to end his own life, being it by himself/herself or by asking someone else to do it.  For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons.   And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending her life through "direct" methods such as a painless poisoning or by "indirect" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating.

4485	Look at the brain in a physical and chemical perspective. Neurons are fired when we see or smell or hear or touch or taste something. Those neurons interact with other neurons, via chemical processes that are well understood. Those neurons interact with more neurons and so on, and so on... Eventually motor neurons are triggered which cause us to respond to the sensory input. In no part of this process can I see a way to affect the chain reaction of neurons in any way. Sure, each of our brains is put together differently and that means that each of us will respond differently to similar stimuli. But given the EXACT same situation our brains will react exactly the same way to the exact same stimuli every time. So essentially, you never had a choice.

4488	No! The science is pretty clear in telling us that the chemistry of the brain is a natural thing. It is not a part of our will. Whatever system we use to communicate with each other, it ultimately works with the rules of chemistry and physics. Maybe humans are just the ones that make the rules.
4489	The brain is an interacting system which cannot be controlled or manipulated.
4490	My rationale is simple:  - dishwashers require the dishes to be "pre cleaned". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities? - dishwashers rarely removed ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually.
4491	My reasoning is simple:  -Dishwashers require dishes to be "pre-cleaned". This defeats the purpose, especially if you don't have a good filter. Why does one buy a dishwasher if one has to install a filter? If you didn't install a filter, any dings on your dishwasher would be impossible to repair once the wash cycle has begun.   - Dishwashers rarely remove ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days. Once the dishes have dried, you need to clean them manually.   - Dishwashers don't properly dry “deep” items such as Tupperware, pots, or even cutlery.  If you're not careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, making the process useless.  -I think overall that dishwasher are overrated, undercapable, overpriced appliances that have no place in a modern kitchen.

4495	By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all blacks grew up in the 'hood, joined gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all whites have nice lives. There is also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

4500	Its absolutely unjustified and completely impractical.  Its the same as Iraq. You dont stop terrorism by coming in and fucking peoples lives up, Palestinians already hate Israel and terrorising gaza only radicalises people and turns them into Hamas militants.  Aside from that, Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives, 50 Israelis have died vs 1500 Palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfire.  This is not about Hamas vs Israel it about the people born in gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare gaza into subservience.
4501	There is no justification for the invasion of Gaza. The Israelis killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians, and the Palestinian’s have done some bad things to the Israelis, but neither of the sides is deserving of an invasion by the other side. This isn't about the conflict between Israel and Hamás, this is about the people born in Gaza and being caught up in the fight between the sides, their lives have been destroyed because of it.
4502	This is not about Hamas vs Israel it is about the people born in Gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare Gaza into subservience.
4503	I don't know why everybody thinks there is an escalation happening when in fact it's a little bit of cute goofing with a little bit of bloodshed.  We need to talk a lot more about why people are attacking their own countries than we do about those who are trying to defend them.  I will only discuss what is happening in gaza, i'm not going to discuss the bombing of beirut or if israel bombed us in response to terror attacks in those areas.  The reason there is a War in gaza is because the issue is a proxy war created by israel (or the western world by proxy).  I will not say whether the attackers are good or evil, because to do that would deflect attention from the fact that it is a proxy war; or that those attacking are being directed towards their own people, terrorists that are fighting their own government, and that they know they are killing innocent people.  In every military invasion there are some good guys who are going to be injured and there are also some good guys who will be killed.  A war is war, there's no hard and fast rules between good and evil like we make with enemies in movies.
4504	Israel's invasion of Gaza is unjustified and also impractical. Besides fighting terrorism, the invasion will only cause the same problems as in Iraq, you can't stop terrorism by coming in and fucking peoples lives up. Palestinians already hate Israel and terrorising Gaza only radicalises people and turns them into Hamas militants. Apart from that Israel has shown blatant disregard for civilians lives, 50 israelis have died and 1500 Palestinians. That alone should show you who is the aggressor and who is caught in the crossfire. This is not about Hamas vs Israel, this is about the people born in Gaza and caught up in it. The invasion is terrorism designed to kill civilians and scare Gaza into subservience.
4505	There are three arguments that illegal aliens should be allowed to remain in the United States.  1. Eligibility to vote  In the United States, right of vote does not depend on citizenship. Right to vote is based on residency rather than citizenship. With a fraudulent vote, those who vote through illegal means will decide all political powers in the U.S. with a view to implementation of the greatest good for the greatest number. Illegal aliens who exercise the right of citizenship will make the decisions for the rest of us. For example, imagine a senator who is undocumented. He could veto bills that affect the third world people. Thus such illegal politicians are elected to be involved in making political decisions. Why should we give them privileged rights by bringing them into the States? In addition, illegal immigrants are eligible to vote in referendums. Thus every trip to the polling booth will count. Therefore, because of voting, they have decided to come into the United States. They came because they are eligible to vote and must.  2. Early political involvement  Even if illegal immigrants are not capable of voting, they have decided to come to the United States to get their education and acquire citizenship. Thus, they have decided to enroll in college. It turns out that the U.S. is becoming a more educated society. In fact, there are students from developing countries including China, Vietnam, India, etc. in the U.S. Thus, if they are active, their contribution to the developing country may be limited by political direction, but they can contribute academically. One could think it is possible for first generation illegal immigrants to determine voting decisions, but that is impossible. They have decided to enter the political arena after gaining higher education and moving to the U.S. This means early involvement, as they have been moving to the U.S. since birth. Thus, they should be permitted to become citizens here. This is only a legal standpoint that they may not earn citizenship but they can contribute here. Education is not only about citizenship, it is also about higher status in the society. Because of education, illegal immigrants are participating in development efforts of their home countries. Thus, they can attain a higher
4506	Deportation breaks up families. Good argument. So does a divorce agreement. Should we end 20 years sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft? Works against amnesty proponents. ileggals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do. Right. Texas was Mexico's. As long as illegals don't vote for this or that politician and do not direct businesses to go there, Texas is not a part of Mexico. 
4507	Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a reply as to why they hold no argument.  "Deportation breaks up families"  Ok, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.   "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do."  This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do.   " Texas was Mexico's"  This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.   I have plenty more, but I'll wait until a debate commences.
4508	Deporting illegals breaks up families because they are unable to live life without the protection of the American government. Ending prisoners for life because their father was separated or divorced due to them committing fraud or theft is like saying that criminalizing various sexual preferences makes them victims of abusers. Getting rid of Mexicans who have given America their might, by earning our prosperity is like saying that we should be ashamed of non American blood that circulates in our veins. Letting illegals citizenship and an American passports so they can travel freely while paying taxes is like saying that we should all be singed on public roads. The only good thing illegals have done is to create unprecedented wealth in this country and further increase the prosperity in America. When President Obama we had Texas, Calif, Rio, Florida etc that were part of Mexico and we all knew that they did terrible jobs at being Mexicans.  To tell the truth, the root cause of this has been an outdated system that has allowed privileged individuals to get away with crimes they committed as teenagers or middle aged adults. Does a person who spent most of their life committing crime get a better chance to become a responsible citizen when he is only 30 years old than when he was 80 years old? The flaw in this argument, as with all equal opportunity laws, is that they do not work. The law does not consider the income level or educational level that one had before committing crime. That is considered extenuating circumstances by the government. The inability to pay rent does not warrant freedom, or be tolerated under the law. What we have is the cheap labor of the illegal worker and the war economy that has inspired countless wars in the recent history of this country. Preference should be given to those who have paid their taxes.  Illegal immigrants have helped Americans by providing cheap labor in jobs that American citizens would not do. They have also provided skilled labor in areas that have been out of employment for so many years. Illegal immigrants have given America housing and provided healthy populations.  The solution should not be an amnesty to illegals, but rather the law be changed to allow legal immigrants to move into the United States. This would create a positive impact on American culture and society.
4509	'Deportation breaks up families', or alternatively the immigration issue causes the break up of  families. However, this is a social issue - not a territorial one. Immigration is a social issue and the idea is for people of all nations to live together. In that regard, it breaks up families.  'Separation of families in the US is seen as a deterrent to citizenship.' This statement is wrong, since no citizen is automatically a citizen, only by virtue of the fact that they have established a legal residency in the United States. In the American context, citizenship is granted by naturalization under the naturalization act, which most immediately affects people who become US citizens by marrying a US citizen, or who are granted naturalization under a special law, e.g. H-2A visas.  In terms of the validity of the above arguments, there are examples of  countries that have no particular political system, in which the  government ensures the social integration of immigrants.  The main exception being France. France is a great example of this, although they are based on the principle of nationhood and the government takes steps to remove immigrants who do not give evidence of being assimilated into the French culture, e.g. naturalizing French students. Knowing this, there are countries that have a dual system. For example, U.S. has an  immigrant population, mainly of Mexican origin. There is a wide gap between Mexicans and Mexicans in the US, and  the government takes steps to make sure that they share the same society as natives. U.S. is a common example of a  country that gives equal rights to immigrants, but never gives them citizenship. In case of Mexico, the principal difference is that they give native Mexican students diplomas and companies prefer to recruit Mexico native jobs when it comes to the pool of temporary employees. In terms of crime rate, only Mexicans who have been in the US for a while commit crime, while Mexicans who are in the US since birth do not commit crime, because they are natives. If someone talks about Mexicans, they are immediately defined as the 'illegal Mexicans', and it will be very hard
4510	At the end of the day governments simply use propaganda to a soda tax will reduce obesity. The reality is that it is just them being greedy trying to make more money off the poor and middle class.  Soda and sugary drinks are far from the only cause of obesity. Obesity is caused by a ton of factors that include over eating, lack of exercise, and general change in human behavior.   The argument is also proven false by the fact that soda has existed long before the current obesity epidemic, and soda has gradually gotten more expensive over the years and consumption hasn't dropped enough to prove that pricing is a huge factor  The comparison to cigarettes and tobacco is flawed as soda is not an addictive substance, and in moderation causes no damage to the human body. In constant to cigarettes which even in moderation can be very damaging.

4515	The movie was really good, but I just couldn't get into it. I understand completely that the movie was created for a specific audience and I think that it did a really good job of continuing the story line. However, it was just too slow and boring for me. I thought I would have loved it more if it had been more story driven and let the viewers wander into the building to experience the paranormal events and had the viewers experience them through their eyes. Also, please do not use the sequels to defend the quality of the first film. I want to understand why the first film was so acclaimed even before any sequels were released.
4516	it was boring to me, but I still think it was entertaining enough to like. It has an amazing opening scene, but after that, the rest of it was just normal people sleeping in bed and people picking stuff out of their pockets (and no, that's not a gay movie)
4517	 I saw the movie and felt like I had just wasted a chunk of my life. The only two scenes that were interesting at all were the ouija board scene and the ending. The rest was just people sleeping with the occasional noise. I can appreciate a slow build (I loved The Blair Witch Project) but Paranormal Activity was just boring to me. I doubt my opinion will be changed, but I just want to know why anyone liked it. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but it is beyond me how anyone could think that film was entertaining or artistically noteworthy. Also, please do not use the sequels to defend the quality of the first film. I want to understand why the first film was so acclaimed even before any sequels were released.
4518	The film was entertaining. I liked the motion capture for the bugs, particularly the planes of the room. The sound, though, did bother me a lot. It was over-used, too loud and kind of annoying to hear. I was entertained but maybe not completely satisfied. Still, I think you should.
4519	The only thing I liked was the one on film II. The rest was pointless sleep, people and stuff. I can appreciate a slow build but Paranormal Activity I was just boring to me.

4520	 I feel that people should have the right to explore their own consciousness as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else in the process. Obviously similar laws to alcohol should exist, where you can't be tripping in public &amp; such. As more and more research continues, scientists are finding that psychedelics such as Psilocybin (Shrooms) and LSD are pretty harmful as far as drugs go, Especially compared to legal substances such as Alcohol and Tobacco. Psychedelics also aren't addictive either. I feel that if all these drugs do is often improve the users quality of life, and they aren't addictive or proven to be mentally or physically harmful, then I don't see why they should be illegal.  Obviously when I say "psychedelics" I'm referring to the ones that are as I described: harmless and non-addictive. Psychedelics such as nBOMe's and other ones that may be harmful should not be legalized.
4521	The life of every individual should be respected, as their life is precious. No one can decide how a human life is going to be or if they should live it or not.

4525	If you just look at Type I diabetics, it's around 1% of the US population. Thus, it's really hard to estimate how many would be affected. Some think that 3 million US Type I diabetics will die in just a few weeks without an industrial system to make insulin and without food sources available. However, the history of Type I diabetics is that they simply slip into a diabetic coma and die. This is why I choose to look at type I diabetics.
4526	Like Type I diabetics, the few people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants will die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people. Like Type I diabetics, the few people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants will die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma. I think 3 million Type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse.
4527	*Edit* In addition to diabetics, people on ventilators and dialysis, and people with organ transplants would die relatively quickly. There is nothing to be done for these people. Since some of these people are obviously healthy, this comment really takes place in the context of a total industrial collapse. These people should be euthanized.
4528	For this view, I am simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a Type I diabetic, so 3 million people.

4530	Because school is a government run institution and as such it's only fair that school should provide a free quality lunch to the pupils. For three main reasons: - The first reason that a public institution that mandates the pupils is there for the amounts 7 hours of the day teach them has validity. - Another reason for this is that if you want to curb obesity then free lunch helps that. - Not all pupils can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning. As a person who just graduated high school last year in the USA, the school lunches were expensive and bad I knew many children who didn't have money to buy lunches nor had time to make them. To change my view.
4531	SS hasn't changed anything here... We still provide a free lunch for everyone in the school and only provide free drinks like water or non-carbonated drinks.
4532	My goal as a journalist is to inform the public of what's going on in the world.  School's should provide a free quality lunch for its students as they need it.  For three main reasons:   1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupil be there for upwards of 7 hours feed them.  2. As a person who just graduated highschool last year in the USA,  3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.  As a journalist I feel that teachers should be able to do this as well, as many kids do not have parents who give them money for lunch.   Change my view as I strongly feel that government should be facilitating a free lunch option for everyone.  
4533	School's are a government run institution, designed for the betterment of it's students. Schools should provide free lunches for all the students based on their economic situation. For three reasons: 1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours should feed them. 2. If you want to curb obesity, you should provide free lunches to poor students. 3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning. As a person who just graduated high school last year in the United States, the school lunches were expensive ($3) and bad, I knew many children whose lunch would consist of chips, candy, and soda, and refused to buy lunch either because they didn't want to spend the money, or because the lunch was poor in quality. Change my view.
4534	Some people think it's only fair that schools should provide a free, quality lunch for their students for three primary reasons: 1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the students be there for an upwards of 7 hours, feed them 2. If you want to curb obesity, 3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning. I'm not here to argue about wheter school lunches are cheap or not,  but they are a safe alternative when a child does not have the resources to eat healthy food all the time in school. Changes the emphasis a bit: Schools are a public institution designed for the betterment of the students, not the students or the institution.
4535	Although prostitution is not a very nice situation, we have to address those who claim prostitutes are "at the mercy" of their clients. It makes government regulation even more necessary. For people who associate prostitution with violence and crime (drugs), wouldn't it be much safer if it were legal, regulated and taxed? It would reduce the crime associated with prostitution (although much of the crime stigma is hollywood created), increase tax revenue and provide safe regulations.
4536	Between two consenting adults. Say the prostitute is in need of money - it is his/her choice how she earns the money and uses her body.

It would reduce the crime associated with prostitution (although much of the crime stigma is Hollywood-created), increase tax revenue and provide safe regulations.

4539	On the one hand, prostitution is between two consenting adults. The prostitute is in need of money, so her choice is how she earns it and uses her body. In other words, the prostitute is choosing her lifestyle, and her decision is neither her responsibility nor her fault. On the other hand, people who claim that prostitution is the "protection" of prostitution can argue that children are exploited and abused by the organizations that legalize prostitution. In order to address people who hold this belief, government regulations would be necessary. For people who fear prostitutes will also attract violent criminals, would it be much safer if prostitution were legal, regulated and taxed? It would reduce the crime associated with prostitution (although much of the crime stigma is Hollywood-created), increase tax revenue and provide safety regulations.
4540	There is some disdain towards people who post things that have been posted before. However, I personally think it's a good idea that people post things that they have heard and shared and tagged before.  It's true that the person who posted the question could easily do a search of previous posts and get their question answered. However, that prevents everyone from seeing the answer if they never thought of the question in the first place.  Let me give you an example, I'm a huge fan of /r/askhistorians, however I've never asked a question on there. I rely on others thinking of interesting questions that I wouldn't have thought of and then reading the answers to those.   It works the same with many other groups.  As there is no easy to way to view historic posts unless they are "top", until people have reposted their own, there is no way for others who didn't see it the first time to see it again.

4545	Private property owners calling a towing company to impound the vehicle on their behalf and the towing company holding the vehicle for ~~payment~~ ransom--is tantamount to theft and should be illegal.
4546	If the owners are private property owners and not the police or the private property owners do not entrust the keys to the towing company so they can take the vehicle to a nearby public roadway or a private property owner's property--then they should be called off and prevented from action. Also the towing company should not be allowed to demand monetary reward or punitive payments from the owner for removing their vehicle for misdemeanor. If the authorities deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be removed and impounded by the police and the vehicle's owner should be told and able to know exactly the amount of time the police have to decide that they don't like the vehicle.  However a violation of a police officer or of a tow company can only ever be enforced by a system of two laws. The state (government) can enact laws, but those laws should not be enforced by individual law enforcement officers or by the 'law' represented by that particular law enforcement officer.   I have no problem with a private party impounding a vehicle when there has been a violation of a police officer or a tow company's road law of the state (rules for the general public).   
4547	For safety purposes, only the police should be allowed to remove a vehicle for a tow, never a private person or company. The vehicle should only be removed from the ownership's home if the police determine that the vehicle's presence poses a threat to the home owner.
4548	Private property owners calling a tow company to impound the vehicle on their behalf--and the towing company holding the vehicle for ransom--is tantamount to theft and should be illegal. I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a police impound lot.
4549	It is okay for a private property owner to call a tow company to remove a vehicle from their property, but only if the police are involved and just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should be allowed to move the vehicle to a public roadway or other available park and cannot be forced to give the vehicle back to the owner.   
4550	There is scientific racism and I think it is the basis of many anti-science assertions in articles like these ones. As a scientist, I want to protect my field from such allegations and should not contribute to this kind of writing. It would be better to avoid it.
4551	Scientific racism is not based on any scientific evidence. People of different origins have different bodies such as skeletons, skin color, height, hair, etc. It simply means that the genetic information which is the basis of human sexuality is located in the chromosomes. I don't think any race is superior to the other because they simply have a different genetic information. Just like the gender differences do not make one superior to another.   On the other hand, I do not want such studies to be done because this could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
4552	I'm sorry you haven't read some scientific racism writing but that's your opinion not mine. I don't think many of its claims have a scientific basis. I don't care about the different races being studied. Just like the differences between gender doesn't make one superior to another. On another hand, I don't want such research to be done because it could be misinterpreted by hateful people.
4553	Scientific racism is completely false. The different bodies between races, say Black and White, do not, and should not be studied. Do we have an obligation to study every difference that exists between the races?   Personally, I'm very sorry that at my university the researchers studying evolution did not set something to stop the racism that was spreading. Didn't they know this is what would happen?  At least the authors of those racist reports stopped their words and left those researches.  Yes, I am against scientific racism because it is barbaric and discourages collaboration. Also, it encourages us to base our ideas on stereotypes which are totally invalidated by science.  At all, I find that scientific racism not welcome.
4554	I've read some scientific racism writing, and I think many of its claims have no scientific basis. Why shouldn't the differences between races be studied? People of different origins have different bodies (skeletons, skin color...) why wouldn't they have a different brain? Note that I don't think any race is superior to the other, just different. Just like the differences between gender doesn't make one superior to another. On another hand I don't want such research to be done, because that could be misinterpreted by hateful people and lead to a resurgence of racism.
4555	Overwhelming majority of historians agree that the Cross of Coronado is not historically significant.  Therefore, there should be no argument that it does not belong in a museum.

Thank you!  _____ While the relic is interesting, it has little historical significance. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. Shortly after recovering the Cross, Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan. He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection. So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing. Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum.

4558	An Internet search will reveal there is little historical significance to the Replica of the Cross of Coronado. Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World. It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose. The relic is a fascinating, interesting one in its own right and it certainly belongs at the museum, especially since it has been found by Mr. Jones.  CMV.

4560	Wikipedia is a single resource that probably not scientifically correct, and in most cases is not well organized. But in my opinion, it is the best source of information that mankind has ever collected. Some may argue that the internet, as a whole, clearly trumps a single source. So let's keep this discussion limited to one single source.

4562	If our species was wiped off the face of the earth, aliens could use Wikipedia to gain a better understanding of us. It could not be in the same context as on a single source like an encyclopedia.
4563	Since aliens exist, what more useful thing could they possibly do by examining our culture? Wikipedia may not be 100 percent reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers more information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together.

4565	Currently, millions of dollars are being spent on research to do cool animal combinations, for example a half gorilla half octopus. Face is similar to an octopus and has 2 legs and 6 wavy arms and it's also furry. I don't buy the "don't play god" argument because I'm not worried about god smiting us for creating abominations. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house. Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt, but I really feel the end result would be worth it.
4566	We must spend millions in research into animals that we could blend together.  For example: a half gorilla half octopus.  Its face is similar to an octopus, but has 2 legs and 6 arms. Also, it has fur.  I don't buy the argument that we shouldn't create abominations because God will smite us for it. Imagine if you could have a turtle with a chicken head just wandering about your house.  Sure the research would cost a lot and some animals might get hurt but I think it would be worth it.
4567	Would you be willing to grant animals the right to reproduce? I know it may seem a bit strange but by making this proposal we've taken away some or many right from human beings.

4570	As far as the question of patents and open source goes, companies pay for tailoring. Your product is protectable by copyright not patent.
4571	Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted). This includes software algorithms. Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards) Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc etc)). The only thing that should be protectable is the final product. It doesnt give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products Most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright not patent.
4572	There are many advantages to computer software being owned by the company that made it rather than trademarked and owned by the patent holder. The main one is that companies can withhold knowledge of algorithms and other secrets to prevent competitors from copying them.   It is also important that the patent holder only owns the patent and not the the source code. Doing so means that all proprietary algorithms are open source because anyone can take the knowledge and create their own production code based off the original implementation. The normal usage of software with closed source code is to carry out third party modifications to existing products. The point of copyright law is not to protect invention, but to prevent copying. Patents are not a deterrent to copying. They can deter when the steps involved to make something are so complex that someone cannot (or should not) attempt to imitate the original.   Any time something that is highly complex and difficult to replicate, there is a better protection than a patent, which is in essence just a way of listing your invention so it doesn't get copied out of your mind.   Ideas can be out of the blue. Knowing the steps involved in making something helps with creating more similar products without the need to have to re-formulate the invention completely.  * Images of the original algorithms (such as the Huffman Alogrithm that governs compression in JPEG) and their implementation are commonly posted on internet forums. Companies will take steps to prevent their patented ideas from getting too far ahead of competition.  See also: Copyright Law, Patent Law, Copyright Getting property without the ability to control the effects that your ownership may have on others, is frequently the goal of people that have a technical interest. To minimize the effects that any of this may have on software development, it is very important that the code for proprietary software is not patentable.  
4573	Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted). This includes software algorithms. * Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards). Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. So if you have an innovative idea and are smart enough to be able to turn it into a trademark, u can sue anyone who has an innovative idea or uses their idea to produce something.   * It doesnt give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. The way software is developed today is usually done by collaborating teams of people. Companies are thus labled by the profession of the developers. This means that new ideas are better developed and coined by professional people and are therefore not available for everybody to have. It is highly probable that companies like Google started as collaborating teams of nerds with laptop computers making them completely unrecognizable to the rest of the population. Again this means that other people with less creative minds can easily come up with innovative ideas while you have to collaborate with professionals in order to have any idea worthwhile or innovative. It has to be recognized that you dont have a monopoly on innovative ideas. This is part of what makes most new technology so interesting. * It doesnt give a meaningful edge to anyone else than a few companies or individuals in the field. The only real monopoly we have are in the sense that industries are actually captured by those companies that have the largest market share. But these companies do not keep that monopoly on creative ideas. But in terms of patents and claims, this is the only monopoly we can have. * Most meaningful software used is open sourced. What companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to

4575	I'm not the one who created the topic by the way. But people are free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices and cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in theory, 100% pure capitalism won't work. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.

It doesn't matter how brilliant the Marxist logic is, pure socialism won't work.
4577	But people who let their whims and desires for power become their masters may have to be held back in one way or another, whether it is by a police state or socialized medicine or some other means. Note that I am not advocating socialism, just controlled capitalism.

I don’t mean white people aren’t bad because there are some things that go on with them too, but it’s mostly black people. I think all monkeys and crackers should have equal rights, but be seperated.

4585	To ban smoking in public places is an overreaction, why can’t it just be a matter of decency, if a smoker is among non-smokers then he shouldn't smoke, if he have to then he just can go smoke a cigarette in the toilet or something like that, I believe if we involve manners in this issue we won't have a problem at all.
4586	This whole issue of smoking in public places is over rated because there are a lot of people who can’t afford to smoke and do still do smoke in public places.

4590	8 years ago I would have ridiculed Americans for allowing celebrities to influence their voting without checking the facts for themselves. Now I have to admit that there is little chance of the facts being avalible to them via regional news vendors and so this might be a decent plan B. Do what your told America, but by someone marginally smarter than the current guy. Apathy has worked well so far and the television tells you which president to vote for so I guess they know which celebrity to vote for too.

4595	If scientists were to focus on our world problems first they may have solved the problem as well as cut down on our population. But if scientists focus on making other planets better to live on they could have fixed the problem as well as cut down our population. What if we focus on the matter and look for a solution while saving ourselves?
4596	 Our world (Earth) has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, pollution and the biggest threat...global warming. Scientists could be focusing on our world problems first and try to fix those before trying to make other planets better to live on.

So, porn sites should all be required to use a.xxx extension so that a router can be programmed to block all incoming connections from a.xxx site. This way parents can block a whole group of sites by blocking domain extensions.

4605	Classical music is a plate form and it is sometimes stagnant; classic rock fans are snobs who want to hear exactly how it was performed for hundreds of years. But they put down neo classical jazz, and they put down "neo-electro classical" jazz etc. Jazz is alive, it's always evolving, it is always adapting the latest music trends - yet it remains jazz. Jazz can take classical, Pop, RnB, soul, Hip Hop, World Music, Folk, etc et al - and it still remains jazz. Oh yeah they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, jazz musicians do not play the same song the same way twice, it's different every time it is played by the same musicians Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the USA - New Orleans and it made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, Jazz is freedom - if you can play, it's jazz, regardless of your background or ethnicity. Jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export.
4606	This is easy. Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends. Yet it remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folk, et al and it is still jazz. Jazz is not stagnant. Jazz is freedom. If you can blow, you're in jazz. Jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export.
4607	Thanks for the reply, but I wouldn't say that classical music is stagnant, although if you count the totalities of Blue Note, ECM, ECM, Milestones et al over the past few decades, it does seem that it is. On the other hand, the longevity of the Beatles is proof that such music can thrive for a long time
4608	What good is this debate in this case. Disputes or challenges between people to see who is right or wrong shouldn't involve this sort of problems.
4609	This is a debate but not a true debate. Is Classical Music "Classic" like classical or is classical music jazz? The only thing I’m personally interested in is composition date or release. Classical Music is stagnant in many ways, and less and less popular. It’s preferred that people listen to classical music live. Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends-yet remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still jazz. Oh yeah sire they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played There is no such thing as some-thing jazz. Why on earth would you want to have something that is as varied as jazz and even very primitive music in your classical music collection. Traditional classical music is something of a slow moving train compared to rock n roll. Rock n roll is inherently more unpredictable than classical music. Classical is rooted in the past, jazz is in the future. Classical music is a special breed of music that isn't easily confused with something else
4610	Hey! It's truly unbelievable that the Supreme Court ruled that it is wrong to have arrested without a court order. I feel that the government has crossed a line. Their initial statements are outrageous and that constitutional values would be sustained despite all. I am proud to represent such a nation. America is the most fortunate and admirable country in the world!
4611	Another term used is a referendum on Bush and his administration that they all promised to do - protect the constitution.
4612	This ruling is a referendum on the desire of many Americans to have a more secure constitutional society.
4613	While the ruling did make headlines most people don't understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for ALL.

4615	Yes, it isn't that hard to get married my grandma got married for about 50 years, and that only ended when she died. I've been married for 7 and Johnny Cash was married to June Carter for nearly 40, and she passed away last week and George Takei has been with the same man for almost 30 years, and people do it all the time. This world is filled with hardship, trouble, pain, financial crises, toil, so it becomes that much more important to be with someone that is special and that loves you even in your darkest hours. I might seem like a cynic and a skeptic but there is nothing I believe in more than I believe in love, the love of my parents, the love of my siblings, the love of my wife, the love of my kids, and the love that I feel for all of them in return.

4620	The only good reason that Test cricket exists is because of the media and people like to see white play white. Tests, the old Guard and a tiny fraction of Cricket fans like this form of cricket. People would rather pay £40 to go see 20 overs of cricket full of 6s and 4's and lots of wickets, rather than sit there a full day and see one wicket and only singles. If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment.</span>. Here is some text: {If he was a punk rocker he would have an incredible marketing agency on his back. His video's were bombed on what turned out to be the quickest rise of a new artist to at least one hundred million views in a year. But obviously this would take many years for his record label to make this happen, therefore he had to be an artist that no one knew about....
4621	Truthfully, Cricket has been very boring since the 80s. The game has been getting a lot less exciting and is now a lot less popular with a generation that grew up with Twenty20 and have never seen a Test match. I think it would be better to just give up this format. Live 5 days of cricket rather than 6, and leave the shorter format cricket for the younger generations. Only about 10% of cricket fans watch Test cricket, and apart from the old guard, it's still a game that most people don't even know exist. There is no point in paying people to watch a boring game with a dull format, because people are unmotivated, not entertained and therefore won't come to the ground. Another option is to expand Twenty20 and create more excitement by extending the format in the way that happens when new games such as World Cup cricket and test cricket are created.
4622	Test cricket is dying out, let's roll on Twenty20!
4623	If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment. Test cricket is dying out, let's whack it on the head to finish it off and bury it quickly to forget about it. Roll on Twenty20!!
4624	According to my calculations, cricket has reached its peak. With twenty twenty crickets taking a hold on the world, bringing much needed excitement to the game it is time for test cricket to step down. If cricket is to survive as a sport it has to get rid of games that last 3 days and don't always have a winner. I would also like to see Cricket as cricket, not die out and become just another sports. If cricket were to expand it needs to be attractive to people and make them want to pay for the game so make it more exciting with long runs, better batsmanship and an increase in the number of overs played. That's the only way cricket can expand and survive as a sport.
4625	Each religion is in the process of spreading their beliefs. If they follow their beliefs honestly, it may be the reason why many terrorist are convert. Maybe that's the reason why most people who are converts to Christianity are poor people. And they are shown the bait of money. So what is spread of belief or the head count? I think it's the head count.

So what is spread of belief or the head count. I think it's the head count.
4627	Each religion is in the process spreading their faith. May be it's the belief itself. Maybe they don't care about what was taught in the past. Maybe it's the prophecy. Maybe it's not what the Bible says, but what it shows us in the future. Just like any other prophecy that has been proven right, it's what the Bible is showing us now. Even though they might have put their money in new religions. As I said, may be that's why many convert to religions and they are poor people that don't have the means to continue. It's only when God is their savior. May be that's what they like. Maybe that's what they think the God likes most of the time.
4628	Religions are spreading their beliefs since they dont care about them if they believe from heart. May be its the reason why most terrorist are converts to any religion. May be thats the reason why most poor people in christianity become convert because they are being shown the bait of money. So why are they spreading their beliefs and how would they spread something they dont care about. I think it might be due to the head count.

4630	Termanator is better than Robin because Termanator is not hafed or skinny. And rob cop is a human and has metal so he can't see everything at night. Therefore, termanator is better. The reason why Rob Cop cannot see everything at night is because he is hafed and human. Termanator can see everything because he is made of metal. Also, when he gets hit really badly, it will hurt him, but it won't kill him immediately. But, rob cop can die immediately if he is attacked, because he has human flesh in his body, and if his skin is torn, he cannot survive that much. However, it is a good thing that the termanator has metal. If it was hafed, it wouldn't be able to survive anything.
4631	Termanater is better because he is made of full metal and plus he said that he can live for millions of years. Plus he can see everything when in is dark. All so he way much smarter than rob cop. Rob cop he is just human and he is made of metal. See thats stupid if he gets beat in the mouth he would die. And also everytime he gets hit really bad he would die faster. But that's why the termanater is so much better. Like if he gets beat he wont die at all he loses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
4632	Termanatonater because he is made of full metal, pluse in the movie he said that he can live for millions of years. pluse he can see everything when in is dark. All so he he way much smarter than Rob Cop. Rob Cop he is just half human and half metal see thats stupied if he gets shout in the mouth he would die. and allso every time he gets hit really bad he will die quicker. but that why the termanater is so much better. Like if he gets shout he wont die at all he looses his own arm, he can still walk really fast.
4633	In point of fact, he is made of full metal and plus he says in the movie that he can live for millions of years. Plus he can see everything when in is dark. He is way smarter than Rob Cop. Rob Cop he is just a human and has metal see that's stupid if he gets bashed in the head he would die. And also every time he gets hit really bad he will die quicker. But that's why the termanater is so much better than Rob Cop. Like if he gets bashed he won't die at all he looses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
4634	thermionather is made from full metal and more, in the movie he said that he can live millions of years. more, he can see everything even in the dark. All for that he is way smarter than rob cop. rob cop he is just half human and half metal, see that's stupid if he gets kicked in the mouth he would die. and also every time he gets hit really bad he will die sooner. but that why the termnater is so much better. Like if he gets kicked in the mouth, he won't die at all he loses his own arm he can still walk really fast.
4635	The Bush administration and now John McCain equate any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/political parties they consider as terrorist to be useless at best. He supports his position by comparing any attempts to talk to Hamas or Iran or other terrorist groups as "foolish delusion" and equating diplomacy to “the false comfort of appeasement” of the Nazi's. My feeling is that this position actually weakens the United States. It's time the government of the United States realizes we can talk to Cuba, Iran or Hamas as part of a comprehensive foreign policy approach and that closing the door on diplomacy actually encourages aggression against the United States.
4636	Any negotiation or active diplomacy with enemy governments or countries/ political parties they consider as terrorist, is not useful, at best it is the false comfort of appeasement for the Nazi's.

4638	Policies like this one make the USA weaker as a nation. We should be actually trying to get involved in other countries and learn from them as much as we can rather than trying to make the USA a leader in other countries. The US government has to be diplomatic and open-minded, not one-sided and closed-minded.
4639	You have better say the state already sent in nuclear weapons to Iraq and they're only waiting to find out how the Americans will react to them...
4640	How are you going to enforce this law? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? {Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car.
4641	How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car". There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way...you shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
4642	Although DUI is an important public safety issue, the likelihood of police detecting a DUI is small. Random breath testing is unnecessary.
4643	When do you trust the police to execute fair and impartial laws? When do you trust them to act according to the law?
4644	How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "We are currently in the DUI patrol. We need to stop someone we feel might be a drunk driver. Can you step out?" "Thanks, mister. Please step out." Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers? Yeah. Which sounds better: a randomly selected officer, or a trained officer in a courthouse, or a trained officer in a jail cell?
4645	...rather than informative news coverage. Sorry about that. I think the media has become a breeding ground for industry and rich businessman. They no longer inform. Is anyone reminded about the 1976 movie The Network? I have heard about it, and that can be displayed as evidence that, today, the news is no longer the news. It's all for the television ratings and to get them, they use ridiculous tactics.
4646	The media is a breeding ground for rich businessman with cigars. They no longer inform. I remember a 1976 movie called "The Network". Well, what do you think?

4648	...rather than the reliable and informative news coverage that used to provide the public. Sorry about that. I think that the media has gone completely nuts. If one were to watch their news program(s), it would seem to have become a breeding ground for people like Gary Jennings, Mark Sanford, Tony Soprano, and the like. They are basically advertisements for their products, for cigarettes, cigars, and other food stuffs, and they tell you that, for example, people had bad dreams about yourself in the nighttime because you ate such and such products. The media tries to pick on people who don't smoke; we are not affected by what we eat. However, we do not sleep well, which we all suffer from now, thanks to all this junk food on the news. What is there to see on the news? Oh, there's a song on a soap opera about a man who was given a gift
4649	I always like the NBC show "The Nightly News'' because it presents informative news coverage. Sorry about that! Well, what do you think?

4650	Firstly, I think that doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. Doodling helps me focus more on what my teachers are saying and helps me retain more things. Simple lines are the best doodling is a tool i use to focus on the things I must do which are the things that are harder to do. It's a great way to just ease into school and not so much be the school superman. I did it back in kindergarten. Secondly, doodling has helped me concentrate on the things that are harder to do which is mostly things that I have to do on my own, which is where I make the biggest mistakes. At school when I don't make the mistake and it is looked at and praised for some reason, I get distracted and don't do much other than just watch cartoons, but I have never feel stupid doodling and don't feel awkward doing it. I think this is a useful way of drawing and encourage kids to doodle.
4651	Doodling should be mandatory in foreign language classes and science classes. It's not easy to remember the things we are learning, but doodling helps us to remember it because of the effort we put into the drawing.
4652	Doodling should be a mandatory activity in language classes and science classes. It helps me retain more in both. Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying. Simple straight lines do the best. Also, I must admit that when I doodle my doodles tend to turn into full blown drawings. Getting off task is what it's all about. I should probably figure out how to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just draw and doodle things.
4653	When my teacher requires me to doodling, it forces me to stay focused and stay on task. It helps me retain more information that way. The simple squiggly lines do the best. You have to keep in mind that when you start to doodle it might get caught up in your mind and begin to draw real pictures with shading and color. That's when I get off task, so I should probably find a way to keep from caring too much about visual appeal and just sketch and doodle things...
4654	First of all, drawing helps people to focus and remember better. In science, things that you must know about can be draw, instead of just writing down it's names, addresses, which one shoots in that movie and how long it takes to fly to the moon. In foreign language, having the option of drawing helps you to think of using your own art form rather than just handwriting, unless you don't want to use any other kind of writing.
4655	To kill a machine takes a gun or bomb or explosives, so if zombies have an inferiority complex by the time they get guns we would have a bigger war on our hands.
4656	In point of view, there are a lot of arguments against the Terminator and i robot. The damage of weapons and destruction is too great. The zombies could be destroyed 1 shot to the head, and could be taken the head off. Plus, the machines can control other machines, cars, super computers, cell phones, and can control whole citys power source and even military weapons like jets and tanks and so on. Once they get hold of guns and such, they will have a huge war on their hands.
4657	We can take all the weapons up our sleeve like guns, tanks and missiles and kill the robots. Zombies are hard to kill because they simply become other people. Machines are like robots except they are controlled by machines. But the machines can kill the robot.
4658	I'm gonna say robots, simply because it doesn't matter which kind of robot you're talking about, either Terminator or "I Robot", they are not hard to kill. Zombies, it's one shot to the head or taking the head off and it's game over. Plus machines can control other machines like cars, supercomputers, cell phones and a whole citys power source and plus military weapons like jets and tanks etc. And once they get hold of guns and such we would have a HUGE WAR on our hands.
4659	Machines simply don't matter. Because, whatever machine, I'm talking about, they are not easy to kill. Zombies, it is one shot to the head, or taking the head off, and it's game over.

4660	Yes, this means a species with a very near universal pursuit of God. How did it get in the equation?
4661	In the last days, special time period, both wise men and wise women will be acknowledged, obeyed, and observed because of God’s decree that all men should be saved and then understood and obeyed as well.
4662	Indeed, why? It should not be a part of what we are. We are the by-product of millions of years of evolution in a world of chance that has no God. All of physics and chemistry teaches us that everything on one side of an equation is represented in another form on the other side of the equation. In this case No God plus No God plus No God through millions of years of evolution equals a species with a near universal pursuit of God. How did that get in the equation?
4663	We are the by product (let us say) of millions of years of evolution in a world of chance that has no God. In this case, No God plus No God plus No God is a species with a Near universal pursuit of God. How did that get in the equation?
4664	Yeah, how did it get in the equation? Let's get the devil out of the equation. I think that God is a supernatural being, like a God is a supernatural being, like a god is a supernatural being, like god is a supernatural being, like god is a supernatural being, like god is a supernatural being. Like it's god. Like this. Like this. Like this.
4665	Absolutely a classic, that's the single best thing about it. The opening sequences are mesmerizing, the mystery is intriguing and the final reveal is well done. They didn`t do justice to Spielberg`s genius in it. Of all the films we make, this is the least-informed ones. The best thing we can do for ourselves is to educate ourselves.
4666	It had a good plot. It was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that until the end. It had a good twist. And underlying it all, it had somewhat of a moral. If you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie, then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.

4670	The food we ate at this past Friday was delicious! Something that really stood out was the Filet Minion and the bottomless basket of garlic fries. It was so good and the prices aren't what you'd expect for such a delicious meal. That's why you're getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!
4671	You get what you pay for. This place was food heaven! It was F'n loaded sliders. Filet minion mixed with blue cheese and bottomless basket garlic fries!

4673	Yesterday we ate at Bacon & Brisket. One bite into the sandwiches and my mouth dropped. I have never had such unique sandwiches. The sauce was a little too light on the sauce for my liking but I used my hands to dip in the meat. My husband had a hand pulled BBQ pork sandwich. I don't know what the name was but the sandwich was to die for. There was so much bbq and pulled pork on the sandwich that it had to be a hand pulled sandwich. Everything you could ever imagine on a hand pulled sandwich it was! The fries were also very tasty. They were crisp and had a great taste. The prices are very reasonable. It was a good value for what we were eating. I would recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends. Bacon & Brisket has a great reputation!

4675	In years, since I have visited the Sizzler, the quality of food and service has continued to be quite good. The meals were average, but served very quickly. I wish they would stock different types of salads on the salad bar and pay more attention to the ordering of their appetizers. On my last visit, I ordered a veggie omelette with sausage, broccoli, and mushrooms. The cost was about $7.49, so I suggest asking for one to go, instead of breaking your fast! The pasta salad in the pasta bar is cheap and one of my favourites. Also, the Best Pasta on Earth is good. Although it tastes a bit different than what one gets from the store. The veal casserole with pasta is unbeatable. I also thought the ribs and cheeseburgers were average. But it was worth it. Overall, the cost of service and quality of food did not break the budget.
4676	I've been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was pretty spot on. The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possibly could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.
4677	Recently I've been looking to really cool places for dinner. I've seen this web site and decided that I've had the best meal ever. It's called Kamado Grill, and is located in Las Vegas. I ordered the beef and seafood tempura tacos and they were the best I've had. I think the texture of the tempura taco was better than any I've ever had. Plus, everything in the taco was big enough so I could easily eat it. Also, the chicken tempura were totally insane. I ended up ordering some soft pretzel fries. They were really good and were also pretty big so I had a lot of luck. The calamari and shrimp were really good too. All of the seafood was swimming in mayo with red onions and lettuce, and was soooo good. The only downside is that it can be pretty pricey. I ended up paying $39.99 for my meal, but that is expensive for just a few tacos. The next time I would order all of the extras. I have a friend who came along with me and he said they gave him a 20% discount for his meal. If you want to go out and try some amazing food, go to Kamado Grill, and they can really make you the most amazing meal you've ever had.

4680	This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack. You can order half size of the appetizers... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety. My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you would be surprised at how big they are. I've been here for lunch and got the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner. It's a great choice, and one a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!

4695	This is probably the worst ribeye steak I've ever had. No seasoning and really over cooked when we requested medium well. The service wasn't the best either...it wasn't busy, but it took a long time to get our food...and our server forgot to put in our order for the kids, so they ended up just eating our french fries. We decided we'd just forego the additional wait and go somewhere else to eat. At least the set up was neat and the kids had a great time playing outside!

4700	We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner. Big mistake. While granted, it was a Monday night (I get that in the restaurant industry), the food was pretty much awful. Over seasoned...overdone. Steak overcooked; Quail undecipherable in it's bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. Wine overpriced. Salad uninteresting and dressing was boring. Appetizer meatballs...well, regular meatballs without pasta. The descriptions were nice but the food didn't live up to it. They had our table decorated (for our anniversary) but didn't offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, nor a dessert for our special occasion. Expensive and um, "let's just go home and have a glass of wine." kind of night.

4703	Carpe Diem food is very tasteless. There are different kinds of meatballs, and the pasta you see in pictures does not come with the meatballs.  Wine is expensive and comes with an appetizer, dessert, and a drink. You must request the wine from the server to your table.

4705	The service was very good. I would order fries and sit at the bar. The food was ok, but not worth the money.
4706	The service was very good or I might have marked this lower. The food was super expensive and boring. The sliders I got weren't cooked all of the way through and the buns were greasy. Other than the service I did like the fries. I would order the fries and sit at the bar as the service was great but would not order the sliders again.

4709	The service was very good, if not great. The food was super expensive and boring. The burgers were very moist but not much meat on them and the sliders were greasy. The fries were great. If I could pick just one thing off their menu I would pick fries. The sliders were good, like a burger sandwich if I were slimmer. The iced tea was good and the desserts were also good. The fries were wet inside, which I always like in a fries, and they were very fresh. The only thing I would change about the dining experience is that I might not sit down next to them if I know it's a busy night. The dining area wasn't always chilled enough though, especially during the

4711	Only in private schools and even there I would only agree with it because it is a voluntary association. You see I think school uniforms suppress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.
4712	Private school uniforms don't supress free speech, and neither do school uniforms suppress individuality.
4713	Only in private schools would I think of it as a voluntary association. You see, school uniforms suppress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.
4714	Uniforms don't supress free speech or take away from youth's individuality. Yes, I agree with school uniforms and voluntary associations in private schools.
4715	To be fair, I wear glasses since elementary school and they got me through it. 
4716	Reading is best. So it's better to read a book.
4717	Too lazy to explain why, so take my word for it. I had to wear one for four years at school.

4725	firefox is better than Internet Explorer because Firefox makes searching the Internet relatively easier than using Internet Explorer.
4726	Internet explore makes searching the internet relatively easier than using Firefox.
4727	How exactly do you know that firefox is better? As far as I am concerned, they're both good because there are no disadvantages comparing these two browsers.
4728	I'd use firefox because internet explorer is a terrible program. Searching online is easier with firefox.
4729	Fire Fox is better than Internet Explorer because it makes searching the Internet relatively easier than using Internet Explorer.
4730	The fact that the only reasonable argument IE users have is that they are cooler or get laid more only proves even more that Firefox is better.

4735	At least FireFox isn't a copycat like IE 7. I don't think IE7 copied fire fox on the tabs.
4736	Internet explorer copied Firefox on the tabs.
4737	Firefox is a better web browser than Internet Explorer because Firefox doesn't copy the tabs like Internet Explorer.
4738	Internet Explorer 7 is a copycat of Firefox, so Firefox has to fight it at every level.

4752	If your wife commits murder and you don't think it is a crime you should still let her have her way in the bed.
4753	She would have to be a liar to accuse me of murder. If you truly love her, you would have her back through anything good or bad.
4754	If your wife commits murder and tells you about it, you wouldn’t turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
4755	Many children don't appreciate the sacrifices of their parents and only because of the simple fact they don't believe in sacrifice themselves so i wouldn't want to be in their shoes.
4756	I don't believe I'd turn her in because of love. But I certainly would not stay with her; I would move away from her as far as I could. For the simple reason I wouldn't want to be involved with the crime, because I knew about it.

4759	Believing that girls aren't as bright as boys is a highly unpopular position, but the simple reason i won't turn them in is because i know about the crime. For the simple reason, i didn't like the way she treated them.
4760	If you look back in history and you look at other empires, India had the most successful after being ruled by other empires.
4761	India was most successful when it was under other empires. They are unable to lead themselves.
4762	India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires because the Indian people became more independent when they were ruled by other empires, then they came back when they felt completely superior to those who ruled them.

4765	neither garments nor toilet paper were invented by American.
4766	No, the 'USA' people are idiots. Rags are for scrubbing toilets, not makeup or headgear.
4767	You shouldn't clean your head with rags because they can only get you soiled hair. Nor should you wear headgear in public, because you only need gloves for that. And the headgear is for sporting events like football and basketball.
4768	YES!! USA!! Why would a runner who has the pedals on there feet wanna wear clothes?
4769	Type, exercise and modesty are the best fashions.
4770	Nah, they can't even organize their streets! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges. They're extremely poor and they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet.
4771	Well, I don't think women should be expected to do all the house work because they are no different to men.

They're extremely poor - they can't even manage their own budget, much less a planet! The Bible is an original literary work of Western literature which has earned a controversial reputation over the centuries. However, modern historians have declared that the Bible is an accurate record of the major events in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the fabled "Divine Trio", and has depicted the sons of Noah with terrific fidelity. Therefore, the Bible should be the most persuasive source of information available.
4775	If I were to have a father I would rather have a less loving one, however I do not want to think about my father as a lousy one. I would really love my father but it would not be the same if you had a bad father that brought you problems. You don't have to have a father, you can talk to someone else. Maybe it is just because I am a girl, so I like talking to my mom.
4776	It doesn't sound bad but I don't want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just kept bringing you problems.

4780	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father.

4785	Farquhar did not tell me to help Singapore when I got fired. That is a person's decision and personal responsibility. I say again you must be in a certain position to be a founder. All that stuff of time, money, effort is invested, you must know people who would help you.
4786	With a boss, you have to follow what is told and not do anything else. So why can hardly Raffles help Singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you.

4801	FireFox can use more memory than Microsoft's browser because it's designed to increase performance. Once all PCs are switched over to using IE7, it is a no explanation to switch back to FireFox because many people don't understand what a difference IE7 makes. Firefox should get their act together because their bloated design is becoming more and more like Mozillia. They were killed off by Netscape, which could use a mouthful of changes and improvements.
4802	firefox is so bloated now. It uses way more memory than previous versions. Once everyone buys a new PC, and gets IE7, they will have no excuse to switch to firefox.

4815	PE classes are supposed to be useful because in PE classes you can get muscles and become stronger, it wouldn't be so easy for you to become fat (you'd also have to keep a healthy diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.

4823	Active and being involved in sports is a good habit that is beneficial later in life. Plus, working together as a team in sports doesn't happen every day in other classes.
4824	Exercise is good because it benefits both the mental and physical health of the child. It helps children work together to achieve a common goal as well.

4982	Well, as an active Patristic Pagan, I am disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. Seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?
4983	As an active Pastafarian, I'm disappointed at the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. I wish there was a sarcasm feature on the Internet.
4984	As a devout Pastafarian, I am disappointed that our religion is not recognized by the internet. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. However, since I am a theist, I must be on this side. Don't you wish there was a sarcasm feature on the internet?
4985	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also, spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
4986	Parent's should not use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they can grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also, spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
4987	No parent should use spanking as an option to discipline their child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved, since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause low self-esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full of anger, and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
4988	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child. In fact, they should not use spanking as an option to discipline a child, at all. They should respect the child's right to body autonomy. This practice could make the child feel rejected, low self-esteem and might cause trauma. Parents should use whatever means they find appropriate in a situation like that.
4989	Parents should not use spanking to discipline their children because they might grow up with a low self of esteem and might be traumatized. Also, spanking shouldn't be used as a mean of discipline because the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
4990	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals. I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
4991	Children shouldn't be spanked because they should be treated as equals, and I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
4992	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals and I wouldn't want my child to hit me.
4993	It would not be a good idea to spank children because children should be treated as equals and so they should not be spanked.
4994	Children should not be spanked because they should be treated as equals. I would not want my child to hit me.
4995	As an ambitious young homicide detective, I would not be lenient with anyone who commits murder. Hopefully, the murder won't be due to a pleasure/delightful killing, so the sentence won't be as severe, but nevertheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
4996	As an ambitious, young lawful homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing wouldn't be as harsh, but nevertheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
4997	As an ambitious young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective I wouldn't be lenient with murderers in my midst. Hopefully, murder wouldn't be the result of pleasure and malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
4998	As an ambitious young woman wanting to become a good and successful homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderers in my life. I hope that the murder isn't the result of a pleasure kill so that sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless all murderers must be sentenced. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that living in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse. Sentencing should be as harsh as in prison.

5000	Yes, if they think you know the truth, they will try to kill you because it will be on their minds that they want to get rid of the truth.
5001	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
5002	That's what I think, I can't be totally sure though. I think it's smart to keep your e-mail on you like a trinket that shows how affectionate you are but to communicate with girls online is like the latest fad.
5003	Yes, there are people that do not care about details. They can easily get rid of clues like familiar people and familiar surroundings.
5004	True, because who knows if they will turn on you and then one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you. Because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth can never get out. They need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
5005	No one should see the government as a force to put pressure on their belief. Even if we accept that the government does put a lot of pressure on things, we should look to the government to support what is right not do things they shouldn't and affect things in a negative way.
5006	Nothing in the government has the right to mandate religious belief.
5007	Why? The government should provide only the bare necessities of life. Worship is a human right and not something to be imputed to the government.
5008	I'm not saying you should abandon your principles in favor of something in favor of the government. I'm saying look to the government in times of crisis to assist you with your beliefs.
5009	Not to be glib, but are you stating that the government should have a mandate to assist you with your belief system? Ever read Thomas Hobbes?
5010	Abortion is only okay for one situation. If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting to do so might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
5011	Only if a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child should abortion be ok. Otherwise no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
5012	Abortion is only okay in the case where a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child. However, it should never be done.
5013	In my opinion, there's only one situation in which abortion is allowed and that is if the mother's physical capacity to procreate is no longer present and trying to carry the baby to term might endanger her life. Otherwise, nobody has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
5014	In the few situations where abortion may be okay, it is for when a pregnant woman is unable to give birth to the child and would die from childbirth. Otherwise, there is no excuse to kill the baby.
5015	I do not see any difference between killing an embryo or a 40-year old person. Murder....is murder.
5016	Many people claim that abortion is a murder but I do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder.
5017	...or a 40 year old person. Murder isn't murder.
5018	Now if you said that you couldn't kill a child during its development, you would be talking more as a moralist than a scientist.
5019	There is no difference between killing a baby that was conceived last year and a forty year old man. Murder is murder.
5020	My question is, why are we arguing about the 'right' to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
5021	Why are we arguing for the "right" to kill the unborn when our government is taking away our real rights?
5022	Why is it we argue for the "right" to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights and privileges?
5023	My one question is why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
5024	My one question: Why do we argue for the right to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?
5025	So if you are going to be irresponsible about it don't let a new life die so you can have a child? WTF!!!
5026	Well, "The Champ" it's not the Woman's body we are talking about, it's a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible don't let a new life die for it.
5027	Well "The Champ" it is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible don't let a new life die for it.
5028	Well, "The Champ" The issue is not the Woman's body, it's a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible don't let a new life die for it!
5029	The discussion of abortion should not be about the woman's body, but about a new life. If you are going to be irresponsible don't let a new life die.
5030	In fact, only a few people in the world practice physical exercise in their lives.
5031	There are people who do physical exercises in their lives, but most people don't apply them.
5032	Besides just a few people apply physical exercises in their life's, many people still sit at the same place!
5033	We should all be encouraged to apply physical exercises in our lives.
5034	Some people actually apply physical exercise in their lives, while some just a few people do.
5035	My goodness! That teacher has the easiest job ever. You just have to yell at kids for an hour.
5036	For teacher, they shouldn't have to spend too much energy for their job. They only have to yell at the children for an hour.
5037	 A PE teachers job must be really easy. They don't need to learn anything, all they have to do is yell at kids for an hour.
5038	It should be a PE teacher's job is to know how to run a baby boomer basketball program. 
5039	PE teachers must be really easy. They don't have to learn anything, All they have to do is yell at kids for an hour.
5040	Gym classes are a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not just to waste time in a useless class
5041	It seems like a waste of time for students to take the class in gym. There should be a test and if they cannot run a mile without stopping every couple of feet they should join the class. There is also the fact they can join to gain knowledge of sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is there.
5042	Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
5043	Gym class is not a useful class for students since there is no test. However, if someone can run a mile without stopping every couple feet, they should be allowed to join the class. Also, students can join the class to prepare for sports. Therefore, students should have that time to use it towards their careers.
5044	It is a waste of time because student class in gym need to be a practice for sports they wanna join. That is their job and not preparing students to be scholars.
5045	It doesn't hurt anyone and we already know that gay marriages do not end the world. They don't kill people either. They just don't bring joy and happiness like straight marriages do. Gay marriages are only hurting gay people. They should get rights to do as they wish.
5046	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marriage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
5047	Are gay marriages killing many people? No. Are gay marriages hurting anyone? No. Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. Enough said.
5048	No, gay marriages do not hurt anyone. No, gay marriages do not kill many people. No, gay marriages are not going to end the world. No, gay marriages are not affecting anyone but the two getting married. No, gay people should not get offensive in regards to each other if they just want to get married. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to keep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.
5049	There will never be any "However," about homosexuality. As long as there are people who claim it's okay to be gay, it is. However, gays are not bad. Gays are people just like everybody else and they can be as good people as anybody else. There have been very few incidents when a gay couple fought and even in these cases, the gay couple was just paying for their sins. Bottom line: Do homosexuals have any right to live in our society? Absolutely NOTHING. Neither God, not human beings, and not law deserve to dictate how another person's lifestyle should be. On top of that, why are even some people putting so much effort into rejecting other people, just because they have a different lifestyle? They do that because they are jealous of others. If they're so jealous they should forget it, but that isn't the case. Bottom line: I know what I'm about to write might be offensive, but you know what? The Church must prove how it is with Christians on the subject. To date, they haven't. I've heard people say, "If your a catholic, you can only admit that things like homosexuality are against God and that anything that can be done to make homosexuality worse is also bad." That's not true, because the Church
5050	You cannot choose someone’s lifestyle because you do not agree with it. You cannot call someone’s lifestyle a “choice” when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a “choice”.
5051	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. Also, homosexuality wasn't a choice.
5052	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice".
5053	You cannot choose someone else's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone else's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."
5054	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality wasn't a choice
5055	Personal pursuits are better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be. I know I want to be a "winner". Which means someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
5056	Personal pursuits are good because people will be what they want to be and not what they want other people to be. I know I want to be "winners". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be "losers." This is personal pursuits.
5057	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
5058	Personal pursuit is better than egoistic pursuit because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". This is egoistic pursuit, because there should be no such thing as a "winner", or "perpetual winners", or "proper persons". While we all can't be the best version of ourselves, we all want to be the best version of ourselves.
5059	Personal pursuits are better because people will be more successful in life and people will want to be people. I know I want to be a "winner". Which means someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
5060	An individual without his own personal pursuit will become selfish and because he cares more about others he will begin to forget about his own needs and wants in life. However, if you care more about the common good, it will be harder for you to follow your own interest.
5061	 I do think that you can have a balance of both. Personal pursuit is important but it doesn't necessarily mean we must focus on ourselves. It is good to keep that in mind, but we do not have to focus solely on self growth.
5062	I believe it's more important to pursue personal wealth because if you're even wanting to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good, but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I think that it's better to have a balance of both.
5063	Although it is important for someone to want to help others, it is equally important for the same person to do something to help themselves as well. There isn't a bad or a good way to help others but if the person fails to help themselves first, they cannot help others at all.
5064	While I do believe it is important to have personal pursuit it doesn't mean that it is always the best choice to do so.
5065	Personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
5066	Personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
5067	Personal achievement is better because it helps one to find happiness in their lives. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
5068	Believing in oneself as a place where happiness comes from is their own pursuit of happiness.
5069	Personal pursuit is better than helping others because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and leave no time for you then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
5070	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world, the city, but only a small percentage of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
5071	Obviously everyone wants to say that they would help mankind, the world, and save the city, but only a small percent of people actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind.

These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
5072	Obviously, everybody wants to say that they would help mankind. The whole notion of the common good, the environment, and those nice stories of saving the world is just something that a small percentage of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuits because I don't know what I would do in one of these situations. I have to admit that I would like to help mankind, but I can see how it would be very hard. Obviously, we all would like to help mankind, especially with all the problems we are having right now. But if people really believed in the idea of helping mankind, then people would do a lot more for mankind. It might even be legal to kill people if it helped humanity.
5073	Obviously everybody wants to say they would help mankind, the world, or save the city but only a small percent of people would actually do so. I would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I don't know what I would do in one of these situations. I also do not think anyone should ever take life away from another person's baby because when a pregnancy has not been planned, it really shouldn't be covered under that argument. There are some very tough problems that we are facing in the world, and no matter who we are they do not change. 
5074	Clearly, everyone wants to say that they would help mankind, the world, or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I don't know what I would do in one of these situations. Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good, all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
5075	My mother never told me to share with others and I always respected that. I am the person that people are counting on so I try to help them, even if it means I have to give up my own interests or gain. I believe there are better ways to live, although we are still few in number to make such changes. I am not going to share my life with others to try to gain popularity, do I? So, then, what is the point of sharing our lives with others?
5076	I believe personal pursuit is better because it's more about you than it is about others. If you can't focus on yourself how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying it's better to focus on yourself.
5077	Advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit because by working for the good of the majority, you are working to advance your own happiness and welfare. Working towards public benefit is not selfish because it is a goal of every individual and not the exclusive goal of any one.
5078	In personal pursuits, it's more about you and how you achieve success that is about you and how you can do well in yourself then it is about others or what they think about you. So if you can't focus on yourself how can you help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad. I'm just saying that it's better to focus on yourself then it is about others or what they think about you
5079	Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally, how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that it's better to focus on yourself.
5080	For example the ability to read increases your willpower or strengthen. The ability to work with anothers powers to develop, to improve and expand everything that is discussed through it and in this manner people even like working together to develop things that they wouldnt have thought of otherwise because of this alone. The people we surround ourselves with, the books and every thing that happens surrounding us just strengthen the ability to enhance ourselves through new skills and the stronger we become the higher our ability to impact each other. This is a true purpose so both are valuable and benefit us even if they are built in a different way.
5081	There are benefits of both! But the main one is personal advancements. You learn about yourself and what you want, and you can use your self for others. And also, you may find that you learn to be a better person for the people around you when you have a job. There aren't any other benefits like no bad side effects when using guns or no bad side effects when using drugs. But those two should be illegal.
5082	There's no better argument than these for why people should do this. You improve yourself and the environment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are both significant.
5083	Both personal pursuit and advancing the common good are both significant and carry equal importance. We don't live in a perfect world. Our lives aren't perfect, but they can still have meaning. This includes avoiding harm to others and refraining from harming ourselves as well. Personal pursuit does help improve the world around us, while the common good can be attainment through education. These two are no different, nor are they the same, but they are important.
5084	Both are good, they share the same purpose, personal improvement and advancing the common good. They don't exist in a perfect world but it's important to start thinking in these terms before you try to improve on your own so you can improve others.
5085	Parents need to be aware of the dangers and help their kids be aware and careful. Also, the media should portray a positive image of young people who don't engage in risky sexual activities.
5086	It's a number of reasons that we can derive from the fact that young girls are out partying and going in places where things might not be safe. It's because girls are going out with boys that they might be exposed to drugs and alcohol, which they don't know what happens in those cases and then are at risk for making love to men that might have them in those situations. Because men have become aware that there is a way to make them drunk, with lsd and other drugs that could make them fall and have sex with them. Young girls are out in bars and nightclubs, and they might be looking for a "good time", which is to have sex. There are TV series that portray a good time for girls, as having sex. And not being cool to go to such places, so there are victims. Because of the mother's role in raising their children, girls can't have control over their safety. Their own personal safety could be their priorities. And the most important fact about this, is that girls are not as sensitive to keep themselves safe, as they should. So girls need to take care, be aware of their own safety, don't give strange men the chance to make you do untrue things on their level, and if they feel they have problems with their dating then they need to talk to their parents.
5087	One of many reasons why date rape is a consequence of all these factors is because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in a variety of places (eg: bars, disco, late night parties, etc) because guys are laying drinks with drugs quite easily and the media portrays "good times" for young people as having sex and uncool to go without it because girls nowadays dont care as much about their safety as they should, they dont think they need to and parents tend to witter upon about how much they should care, and thus teenagers react by going all out with guys giving them the opportunity they are looking for and uncool to think that they can just go around and say;'don't do that, it's stupid to date rape' because the antennae of girls are not as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim of date rape thus date rape is a consequence of all these factors
5088	There are several reasons why it happens, like the girls are out looking for a good time and the guys are doing their "lacing" drinks with drugs, then the media portrays the "good time" to young people as "sex" and the stupid selfish parents don't think about the safety of their daughters, then there are girls who don't think their safety is a priority anymore and if parents try to warn them they will react by throwing all their "love" at these "strange" guys giving them the chance they are looking for.
5089	There are a number of reasons why girls act the way they do. Because the girls are out looking for a good time with guys in potentially the wrong places - ie the bar, the disco, late night parties, because guys are "hinging" drinks with drugs quite easily, because the media portrays "good times" for young people as "sex" and as being uncool not to have it, because girls don't think their safety is their priority anymore, and if parents try to warn them they react by going all out with guys, giving them the opportunity they are looking for, because the "safety antenna" of girls aren't as sensitive as they should be to keep them from becoming a victim of some bully, thus date rape is a consequence of all these factors. So girls need to take care, be aware of your own safety don't give "strange" guys the upperhand if you don't want to be a victim of some bully.
5090	On the one hand, a conversation recorded over the phone in plain sight (it is commonly said that public camera catch an naked male or female have the distinct characteristics of betrayal) can be used in a court of law as evidence. On the other hand, when a private conversation is not recorded and exposed to the public, some people still believe that the secret of such conversation can be used as evidence in a court of law.
5091	Many people are hooked on drama and they really do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.
5092	Without the conversation being used in a court of law, it cannot be used as evidence.  I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it.  Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.  They will suck you dry.
5093	If the person talked to the police before they hooked up with the alleged rapist, they were not giving him a show or giving him a handout and they could say so.  In any case, the conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law and it was not even recorded by the alleged rapist and since he admits it he wasn't bragging but basically apologizing to the police for breaking the law.  There are so many scenarios it is confusing to someone who does not understand.  A shool teacher could be in the same room and not really say it.  If he just knows he has a sick mind it's not a crime. All people do things for reasons, we are all just trying
5094	In point of fact, a conversation can be used in a court of law. However, I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama. Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.
5095	No, they can't force you to, however it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation.   I do not believe in god and I'll never swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead I make only a documented affirmation, it works and is completely legal.(saves on notary fees to boot)
5096	No, they can't force you to say whatever in any way, but it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation.   I do not "believe in God" either, I also will not swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead i make only a documented affirmation, it works and is completely legal.(saves on notary fees to boot)
5097	They can't force you to believe in god. However, it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation. "I do not believe in god" also means "I deny the existence of god". Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so, instead, I make an affirmation that a notary might later confirm. It works and is completely legal. Saves on notary fees as well.
5098	No they can't force you to sign anything saying you believe in god or in a particular state or country or swear an oath to any state or government. Many legal documents require a notary seal. I refuse their legal advice so instead of signing their blank page, I make only a documented affirmation that they didn't even ask me for, it works and is completely legal. Save on notary fees to boot!
5099	No they can't force you to. However, it may impair your credibility so you can instead make an affirmation. I do not "believe in god" either, I also will not swear an oath to any state or government either. Many legal documents require a notary seal, I refuse their oath so I make a documented affirmation that is legal.
5100	If they have already spent their portion of what they got, they should be able to sue them for a part.
5101	Whenever a parent dies, the executor is supposed to divide the remains equally among the children. Therefore, whenever any of them sell the remains, they are supposed to get their fair share. However, when the inheritance is sold to the beneficiary, it doesn't matter if the owner has already spent his or her share of what he or she got. In fact, in every way, they are still required to pay their fair share of what they get. Thus, a person may sue the executor or any of the children to get his or her share. As long as the children act selfishly and unethically towards each other, they would always owe each other their fair share.
5102	If the executor is supposed to divide equally, then the proceeds must be equally divided. The executor can't use the resources of the estate to fulfill their own financial desires, or their financial family, or anything else.
5103	The executors of the estate are supposed to divide up the remains equally, I think. If they sold it, it doesn't matter if they already spent their portion of what they got. You can sue them. It's a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parent dies.
5104	The executor of the estate is supposed to divide the remains equally, and that means for everything that is sold, you get an equal share. If they sold the remainder they get a share of that that can only be spent towards giving the remainder back to the legal heirs. If they sold the remainder but they spent it or spent their share they still owe you your share of the remainder. You can sue them. It's a shame people act so selfishly and unethical towards each other when their parents die.
5105	To reform criminals, one must not only be aware of them but also be willing to help them. Moreover, criminals should not only be aware of their crimes but also being in command of their lives to do what they want. So, in order to do so, capital punishment shouldn't be banned.
5106	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal; however,          1. there are some cases where a person is beyond the process of reformation and starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopaths and         2. in some other grave cases, the convict has done such a heinous crime that conscious of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts, capital punishment is needed.          3. even law commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban it; particularly in the Indian system.         4. further such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner i.e. by hanging         so, i feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
5107	Capital punishment has a purpose. It is to reform the criminals. There are some cases where a person is beyond the process of reformation, and he starts enjoying his criminal acts. Such people are called psychopaths. Some other cases where a convict has done such a heinous crime that conscious of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts, capital punishment is needed. There should be laws that the people must obey, and never disobey. The punishment should be given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner. i.e. by hanging not by whipping. So, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
5108	The purpose of punishment is to reform the the criminals but in some cases the convict is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopaths and murderers. In some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that conscious of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts capital punishment is needed. Even law commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban capital punishment specially in Indian system. Further such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner i.e. by hanging so, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
5109	Capital punishment is a goal in which reforming the criminals is an aspect but sometimes, a person is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers and psychopaths. So, in some other grave cases, the convict has committed a heinous crime that a normal person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts, capital punishment is needed. Even law commission in its various reports has recommended not to ban it, specially in Indian system. Further, such a punishment is given in keeping the norms of the society in mind and in a least cruel manner, i.e. by hanging so, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
5110	Driving is not only a job but it requires a persons 100% attention. Using a cell phone while driving can divert your attention into dialing a number while having 2 hands on the steering wheel. While it may not be a law in your state, always set an example by not using your cell phone while driving. I have seen drivers who were not paying attention because they were on their cell phone.
5111	Driving requires a person’s 100% attention. While using a cell phone you will divert your attention to dialing a number. It is always best to have both hands on the steering wheel. I have had my fair share of drivers that were not paying attention to cause they were texting and they cause many car accidents, and driving is not a safe way to do business.
5112	Driving requires a persons 100% attention. When using a cell phone your attention is diverted into dialing a number, and it's always best to have 2 hands on the steering wheel. Please avoid using your cell phone while driving, even though there may be no law in your state.

5115	The ACLU would have nothing to do with this case. They generally only take cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties. There’s no source for this case, and I can only assume the ACLU had nothing to do with it. The answer to your question is “no.
5116	First of all, the ACLU would not take this case because they generally only take cases involving the government infringing on people's civil liberties. Second of all, where are your sources for this case? You have some specific details, so surely you must have some news story or a link to more information? I have a hard time believing your statement. Third of all, the answer to your question is “no.”

5120	Don't you mean the New York Times? Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story... What a scam! The IRS is monitoring how each reporter is processing any income they get. In particular, they are checking how they are filing for tax credits. Thus, no reporter can get over $100,000 per year to cover their living expenses or other costs, like medical expenses, etc. Bush has clearly stated that he would force reporters to get medical insurance!!!!! So, if the publishers happen to ignore or disregard this pressure, that means there is a bunch of misinformation going out!
5121	Don’t you mean the Washington Post? At least they happen to be the paper that the Bush Administration is targeting. Although the Governor has a website, and a magazine dedicated to this very issue! Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story... What a scam! President Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements, since 9/11, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding!!! Just another disgusting Bush Administration tactic to distort and distract!

5125	To those whiners, if it weren't legal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug.  It's made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people who trust their efforts.
5126	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
5127	No.   Whoever made the first'response' is a prime example of how powerful propaganda is.    I don't ever remember hearing of a VALID case that had anything to do with the use of marijuana and someone being violent, much less some killing spree.    Regardless of what the government provides as services for those who are ill, it shouldn't have the right to totally ban the use of certain substances.   ESPECIALLY when those substances are LESS harmful than the ones that are legal!   Wake up guys!    NEWSFLASH: You can die by drinking too much water!   Just because you'll get help from a hospital or whatever doesn’t mean they should ban water.   Where is your logic guys?   Also to those who whine about it being a gateway drug: If it wasn’t illegal, it wouldn’t be a gateway drug. It’s made bad only by the hypocritical efforts of the government and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
5128	I find it funny to see how even some misogynists are trying to destroy a woman's right to have the choice to control her own body. In theory, marijuana use is dangerous, but it is NOT a gateway drug and should not be illegal. What a joke this is.
5129	WHAT is wrong with this? Marijuana is LEGAL. So is beer. Why make it illegal when it isn't harmful?   AHEM...Truth In Advertising, it is quite unusual in my opinion that a product is displayed on the show that it does NOT sell.  For example, when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle went through their wedding photos, they were shown things that they didn't want to share publicly.
5130	You're afraid of him having rights to raise the child should you die. If you don't want him to have rights to is child, you'll need to get him to sign a legal document signing his rights away. Of course if he does sign his rights away, he won't be liable for child support. Check with your local social services office and ask them if they can tell you if he signed the legal document signing his rights away. Yes, do bring him forth and establish paternity.
5131	He has full rights to raise the child should you die. If you don't want him to have rights to the child, you'll need to get him to sign a legal document giving his rights away.  Of course if he signs his rights away he won't be liable for child support.  Check with your local social services office & ask them..."If he signs away his rights to this child will /can the back child support still be collected?"...Yes, do bring him forth & establish paternity.
5132	I'm afraid that if he doesn't die, he will have rights to the child even if you pass away. So, before you die, you need to let the court know that the child is yours and you want to live with him. Go to the social services office and ask them... If he signs away his rights to this child will the back child support still be collected? and they will tell you a) Yes b) No, and I would gladly pay child support for my child.
5133	He will be forced to pay child support if he signs away his rights to the child. Check with your local social services office and ask them 'If he signs away his rights to this child will /can the back child support still be collected?' Yes, bring him forth and establish paternity.
5134	His name is Michael James Nolan.
5135	Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.

5137	Even though the sentence was ridiculous to begin with, you spent years working to get her paroled from 20 years of a sentence for possessing two-thirds of a gram of cocaine and even though she betrayed you, you still do not believe that it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
5138	To go from no purchase to a 20% tax increase in alcohol would be quite the change in behavior for most of the people.
5139	If the sentence was ridiculous, it was because of the idea that people should be punished in proportion to their crimes.  This is not generally the case.  A non-violent drug offender who is raped while in prison, can be punished 10 times more harshly than a violent drug offender.  I worked to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram.  And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.
5140	You can be ineligible for unemployment benefits if you were not working and applying for them, even if you are the only person who is unemployed.  This is because someone else is claiming benefits for you for tax purposes.  It is common for employers to pay their employees out of their own personal funds so that they will be ineligible for unemployment and as a result, it is not reported as being unemployed.  This causes a problem because if they catch you at the end of the year, you are ineligible for the benefits for the entire year if you didn't claim all of the year.  Also, it allows them to cheat you.  When you get caught with fraudulent unemployment benefits, they can bill you back for all of the funds you had in your account before you were caught.  This is even worse than paying for them yourself.
5141	If you haven't filed tax returns since your baby's birth then you haven't been working, and have committed fraud.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it.  Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.  When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and/or your name.
5142	Were you eligible for unemployment? If you aren't then you have committed fraud. This can be a felony in most states. I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today in most states employees have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you. The other main way is with your taxes. When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands or name.
5143	If your employer did not report your unemployment, you may have been caught FRAUDING the state. Also, this can be a felony in most states. I’d try and get it straightened out before they come after you, because they will notice this. They will be more cautious with it now, because of the Child Support Law. When you file taxes, you will notice that the W-2’s were filed in your husband’s name.
5144	Once you are eligible for unemployment then you've committed fraud if you haven't filed it correctly. This can be a felony in most states. I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today in most states employers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you. The other main way is with your taxes. When you file they will notice the W-2s filed in your husbands and your name.
5145	From what I understand, the state does not make money from putting kids in foster care. However, the situation that has my sister is very hard for her to handle. She must visit the foster home, the parents, do at least one visit with them and go to court monthly for each case. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
5146	My sister, in full disclosure to the world, only helps foster children in the county that I live in because the state sets the rules in that county and the county sets the rules for this business. Fostering takes your time and your love and it requires a lot of money to keep the children in safe, stable homes. It costs not just the state, but the parents as well, which makes it more difficult for their life to stabilize. With less money, the state is not able to care for all the children that need to be placed in foster care and that ultimately increases the number of children that have to be placed with foster families. As sad as it sounds, there are not enough foster families. This is sad because there are over 1.3 million kids in foster care and if we don't give them parents that love them and are there for them, they don't get away from the cycle of poverty. We know that money isn't the only issue that contributes to these children being in foster care because we see other ways to treat children like there isn't a problem that effects their health and education. With the amount of money that we would spend placing these children with foster families we could actually provide them better care, than the current governmental regulations allow. Each child needs the love and guidance of a loving foster family, but the state of Indiana and the federal government should only be supplying the children that are more likely to receive aid or have an amazing opportunity for a stable, loving home. With the number of children that need loving caretakers, we would see a dramatic drop in the number of kids in foster care and the government would be able to spend the money it currently spends on the foster care system on things that
5147	Before their national average wage was so high and after their national average wage was so low.
5148	My sister does this for a living and their departments are severely under-funded and understaffed. The workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officals that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation is not going to improve. It's really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them. There's just not enough hours in a day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
5149	I don't know where you're getting the idea that foster care workers make a ton of money from putting children in foster care. It is a costly or unpopular policy.
5150	I'm not sure I exactly understand the supposition you're making. In general, however, I would argue that moral and legal can be viewed as a Venn diagram - an act can be both, one of the other, or neither. We probably wouldn't want it any other way, actually - hence the saying that "you can't legislate morality."

5155	To be honest, I don't know.  I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing.  Probably the defense lawyer is more of a general practice attorney, that works on many different kinds of cases.  Or, maybe he's an idiot. Worst case scenario - he's trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.

Or perhaps your husband is an idiot. I guess worst case scenario would be if he was trying to save the ability to claim inadequate representation if you kick him around in court.
5157	There is no "case" being claimed by the defense lawyer.  He's an attorney working on many different kinds of cases. Probably his job is to defend people and see what the defense looks like for them.  In your case, it looks like a good defense attorney.  I would check with him to make sure he's not telling you the truth, but I don't think it looks like an accident.
5158	I dont know, I always call my electrician to help fix my plumbing. Maybe my husband is a general practice attorney that works on many different cases. Or maybe he is an idiot.

5159	Every professional should have to have the willingness to educate and be open to explaining how something works.
5160	I am not American, I am Canadian and very proud of that fact.  There are things I admire and envy about the US but then on the other side there are also things I do not appreciate or admire. This war in Iraq is one of them...  I think it was a huge mistake to go in and do what they have done. The civilian casualties are such a shame!

5162	I'm not American and I'm also not Canadian. There are many things that I don't appreciate about the US and at the same time, there are also many things I admire. This war in Iraq is one of them. I think it's a terrible mistake to go into Iraq and do what they have done. The civilian casualties are a very sad situation!
5163	In my opinion, it was a huge mistake to go into Iraq with all these weapons, and massive casualties, and a lack of understanding of the origin of their quests. It was completely wrong!

5165	When I lived in Michigan, we have a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving. Does anybody know why?
5166	We had a similar situation here in Michigan when Drinking Driving was first implemented. In other states that don't have a Zero Tolerance Law the laws aren't the same.  In California drinking and driving is taken more seriously and no one's license can be taken away for an intoxicated driver. On the other hand, people that just have minor in possesion of alcohol receive much harsher penalties in the state of Michigan.
5167	If you live in Michigan, they will.  Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking. \\\n\n-I just thought I would update this for all you who have chastised her for drinking and driving. No where in her question does it say she was driving!  If she had been drinking and driving she would have gotten more than just a ticket for minor in possesion of alcohol some states will take away a minors driving license just for being in possesion of alcohol even when they are not in a vehicle.
5168	If you live in Michigan, they will. Michigan has zero tolerance for underage drinking. You can't force a minor to drink alcohol, nor can a state say 'yes, this is how I want them to behave when drinking.
5169	While it has nothing to do with her question she is a victim in the case if she gets into an accident because of her intake of alcohol and therefore it is a crime to commit, regardless of how many cars are involved. A minor should not be allowed to drive, and none of her siblings should be driving.  Other states may take away her license even if she is not in a vehicle.
5170	We shouldn't be criticising the right to swing our arms except that not being able to do this in a confined space seriously threaten safety.  Other than this, we shouldn't be criticising the right to say what we want as it doesn't affect safety.
5171	You can't say what you want? You never thought about making the policy and deciding whether or not it will bring the bad things you want to stop? What? You can't say anything that can possibly hurt somebody else. Lawmakers can just try to figure out whether or not it can affect them!
5172	There cannot be any arguments about who has the right to express their views. The right to speak in public without fear of being attacked. The right to try to get ideas across without being gunned down. Even using foul language can violate this rule.
5173	There is no exact line between expressing an opinion, and intentionally frightening or intimidating someone.  You can swing your arm but you should not yell "Fire!" in a crowded theatre or solicit murder. Laws against criminal threats and intimidation can only achieve their goal if they can be enforced.
5174	You can't say what you want, even if it says offendances against the law, because nobody is going to do anything about it. You can say some rude things that might offend someone, but no more.
5175	Depends on what you're going for and the impression you're trying to make.  If you're trying to give the impression that you're a fine upstanding citizen who should be let off the hook, then I'd go with none of the above.  If you don't care about the impression you're making, then go with the Birks, clearly.
5176	Depends on what you're going for and the impression you're trying to make.  If you're trying to give the impression that you're a fine up-standing citizen who should be let off the hook, then I'd go with no of the above and choose something more traditional.

5180	All these government controllers are taking a reverse side- like, "they reckon we're a criminal already, so why not do crime?" We still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchipping us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights. Even though this will still work, what if we have problems with information corruption? Who is to stop the self-deciding criminals in doing things without reporting or just missing something? What if everyone has different antihero personalities that would get them crimes? Nobody will judge anyone else! There will be no laws! The Constitution will be useless, at least on a practical level! That would be great. So, you still say that we need to have private companies in the ID card business, right? The system proposed by the civil rights movement would let them out of all this control and shit, but then most of what goes on in the system is hidden from the public eye, and then the government official who does some 'nice' thing will get all the flak (or vice versa) and nobody would know who really did a good or a bad thing. Those are my thoughts, clearly not based on any logical conclusion.
5181	In point of view, everyone is innocent until proved guilty and having everyone on a database would be taking the opposite stance and like, "you're a criminal waiting to step out of line" terrible. It could even have a reverse effect, like, "they reckon I'm a criminal already, so why not do crime?" we still have the right to privacy to an extent, and having all our details on a database, microchip us when we haven't done anything wrong, that be a huge violation of personal rights. Nevertheless, the biometric ID card will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, who will monitor the people who monitor the database?
5182	For certain police sectors- this system will be relevant for those who understand the technology and as we enter the technology age, that will become relevant. If you are a normal citizen or a police officer- the use of this system won't affect you too much. However, if you are an arms dealer- this system will be very relevant to find your counterfeited weapons for you. The crime is stopping now- but it will be back in a few years when new drugs will be made illegal, we are just at the beginning of that....
5183	Assuming that the system you are suggesting is actually implemented, it will be very unlikely to make crime reduce. Even if you have everyone on a database and microchip them when they haven't done anything wrong it wouldn't stop the criminals. Thats why you still have personal rights. Having everyone on a database still means that there is only one system. So, whoever manages this system can monitor everybody else. What about a medical record if they aren't at fault? It wouldn't prevent them from committing acts of violence. The government won't stop them from committing those acts. So while it might save some lives- it might at the same time open up gaps for other types of violence. Its a double-edged sword.
5184	 The biometric ID card is like being microchipped like the US DMV but they have to do it 'right.' It will be similar to the system you are suggesting. We'll see if the crime rate goes down... Even if you have everyone on a database, who will monitor the people who monitor the database?
5185	If someone is sent to prison for drug abuse then they should be in a rehab center.  Note, that's drug abuse, not selling drugs. Drug dealers should have prison time, but the punishment should fit the circumstances. If the drug abuser commits crimes to feed his/her addiction, then jail time for the criminal activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse. As for murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher. And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
5186	Thoughts on how to address drug addiction and murder. For murder, I've been in prison and I've seen other people who have been sentenced to death. Sending offenders back to the community means they go back to society, meaning they are shown the consequences of their criminal behaviour. Capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is, and I'm not in favour of it. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out. For addiction, my thought would be to force the addict to go to rehab centers.  I have been a prisoner in the past and I know there aren't that many hospitals within the prison system that have the ability to treat drug addicts, and so I'm not sure that incarceration is the best approach. Hopefully I could contribute in some other ways.
5187	Sentencing is important because there needs to be consistency between the punishments as well as bringing the justice to the offenders. There is a punishment for the criminal actions and in such circumstances the punishment should fit the crime.  If the drug abuser commits crimes to feed his/her addiction, then jail time for the criminal activity, followed by rehab for the drug abuse. For murderers and rapists, I think the sentencing needs to be harsher.  And capital punishment needs to be enforced better than it is. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.
5188	I think people who do drugs should have criminal treatment. However, sentencing must take into consideration the circumstances. If a person commits a criminal offense to feed their drug addiction, then the person goes to prison for their criminal activity, and has the time follow by drug treatment. I think capital punishment should be enforced better. 30 years of appeals and going through the legal system for a capital murder is too long for justice to be meted out.

5190	It's not legal because it cannot be regulated by the government, because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use). Wacky thing, why would a person legally buy a weed in drug dealers place on occasion? Because they want to try it? Or that they like having access to it outside the dealer? Because it costs a lot less than buying coke or heroin? Because it has no mess with it's 'nothing. I do it once a year, next year's gonna cost 5 times more... to me it's a dumb idea.
5191	It isn't legal because it can't be regulated by the government because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use). Its also because it has not always been legal like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it-- which would lead to increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality-- and all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do. So it'd also cause a spike in crime, probably gun sales, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics. So to me its a dumb f--king idea.
5192	There's no moral foundation to regulating the possession of cannibal tablets (although there could be a cultural foundation, because eating meat would put a human being in worse physical condition, and we don't go around screwing humans around). There is however a physical foundation-- since it's available and cheaper than salted pretzels, it can be purchased with stolen money, which leads to starkly-impoverished working-class people spending it on the drugs of the swanky class. So let's say a tiny dose, and regulate it so that you can't buy more than one (since the more you have in there, the worse it is). Also legalizing it will make illegal drugs like alcohol, which may be less dangerous, look more appealing since nobody will be able to buy them, and so they may be reduced in use. On top of this, if you have more of it than a tiny amount, this will increase the danger of having a child from promiscuity, as there's now more supply.
5193	Because it's legally never be regulated by the government, since it's previously never been legal in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it but also have problems like an initial spike in drug usage, increased costs from more medical care and wages, and crime due to the drug dealers needing to find other jobs. My guess is that it would be somewhat restricted and wouldn't be accessible to everyone because it seems to cause too much damage to the body. Also, since it has been illegal in some countries it'd lead to that initial interest in it's use, and before being popular enough it'd be hard enough to find drugs in it.
5194	It's not legal because it can't be regulated by the government, because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use), and because, since it hasn't always been legal like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it-- which would lead to increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality-- and all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legit job-- so it'd also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sale, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics.  I guess legalizing it would be good.
5195	sex with minors is ok for people in their maturity but if it involves a hot woman and a male minor, it is good. If it involves a guy and a girl minor, its bad.
5196	Do you mean having sex with minors or minors having sex with each other? The laws should be less harsh for minors having sex with each other if that involves a sexy teacher.
5197	How many minors is it if they are 18 years old or 10 years old? That sounds like an impossible task or even absurd
5198	What if the relationship is between a grown and a teenager who knew each other or even sometimes had some intimate knowledge of each other before there sex? Should they pay the price even if the sex was legal and consenting?   When does consent extend? How does one find consent? What are the signs of consent and when are they signal failures?
5199	An example would be when a hot teacher gets in jail for doing it with a male student. For what? Making him one of the luckiest guys alive?
5200	If everything is in order between you and your mother, I see no reason why you couldn't venture off on your own! Check the local laws and statues in your town. Usually eighteen is the adult age, but there are exceptions to the laws in some areas. If you live with a relative, and he is the head of house, and you are under eighteen, then a guardianship contract must be amended by both parties, your parents and the adult head of the house or parents-in-law. But I really don't think they will make a big thing out of being one year away from adulthood for you, or anyone else. I say, just pack your bags, and with your mom's blessing, go off and find your destiny my child! Have fun and stay out of trouble, ok? LOL

5205	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off between saving the child and using their stem cells for research. I favour harvesting stem cells from donated cord blood. There is no reason at all why embryonic stem cells are needed at all in order to do the research that holds such incredible promise.
5206	Since stem cells are abundant in the blood remaining in the umbilical cord after delivery, there does not need to be a moral trade off. I favour using donated cord blood and see no reason at all why embryonic cells are needed. For research, we probably would have no reason to object to using more than one type of tissue, as long as the consent was in writing and we were given the opportunity to opt out
5207	Let those who were able to save their precious cells in the first place do it. There is no morality or ethics to the ethical discussion at hand.
5208	In a philosophical way, we agree that there are other viable methods to produce stem cells and we can't see a moral basis to creating embryos... I favour using donated cord blood as a source of stem cells.

5210	To make murder punishable by murder is a joke. What is the difference between a criminal and a law if both are committing murder. Also, if I were facing life in prison I would much prefer death penalty and I'm sure many people on death row feel this way. Fortunately, our country has abolished the death penalty long ago and now killers have to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives rather than getting an easy way out. We're supposed to be promoting modern liberal western values to the rest of the world but it is not very good when the West's leading nation itself cannot follow these ideals.

5212	To be able to feel empathy one has to be able to understand and to have that kind of compassion that we as humans have. Im not saying that one has to have a hangman bone in the bone, one has to get to know the murderer or the victim etc... I simply say that people of the west just shouldn't follow the capital punishment but in my country we abolished the death penalty and we ask people to live with their problems for the rest of their lives instead of getting an easy way out. We are supposed to be promoting modern western liberal values to the rest of the world but in my country we are actually doing the opposite... we should go back to the old ways and get rid of capital punishment so that people can live the rest of their lives with their problems but we are actually doing the opposite...that is what i am trying to say
5213	It is a joke that criminals should be punished by criminals. The law and punishment are different things. As for people on death row, they would much prefer the death penalty to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives. In my country, we abolished the death penalty long ago, and now killers have to live with their nightmares for the rest of their lives. We are supposed to be promoting modern liberal western values to the rest of the world. But the West is not very good when it does not follow these principles.
5214	Why punish murder with murder is a joke, what is the difference between a criminal and the law if both are committing murder. Also, if I were facing life in prison I would much prefer the death penalty and I think many people would feel that way. Unfortunately, in my country we abolished the death penalty a long time ago. Now killers have to live with their nightmares forever, rather than getting an easy way out. We are supposed to be promoting modern, liberal values to the rest of the world, but in my country we cannot follow these ideals. 
5215	Is this a question, or a USA bashing I'm not sure. I often ask myself that same question though. The most honest answer might be because we can control our technology, and we have the power to control proliferation too because we see it as a danger. In general, it's probobly not a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to have Atom bombs. Do you really think nothing bad would happen if every country had enough bombs to destroy the planet? Yea that would be swell.  I do have to admit there is a certain irony to the United States being so controling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the ONLY county crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one... Yep.
5216	What is the joke? Why would you think the U.S. should be the only country in the world that has an atomic bomb? Isn't it bad enough with other nations waging wars on each other and are able to easily and painlessly wipe each other off the face of the earth? Doesn't it seem like war was inevitable when 3 countries tried to start using nuclear weapons? The leaders of those countries must have been very evil people to want to wipe the rest of us off the face of the earth. But I say we shouldn't be so controling about technology and their weaponry. Well yes, one should, but you should always remember freedom above all else
5217	Radical; perfectionistic nation. I cannot express a need for total control of nuclear weapons. There needs to be stricter control of nuclear proliferation.
5218	Being controling about nuke is a good thing, but the real reason the us is so controling is because we can control our technology and can control it's proliferation too. In general, it's a good idea for every Tom, Dick, and Harry country to have enough nuclear bombs to destroy the planet. Do you really think it will be beneficial to have every country posses enough nuclear weapons to destroy our earth? Yea if they would ALL destroy the planet then wouldn't there be no more wars? Probably, there's something more important then nukes.   I do have to admit that there is a certain irony with the United States being so overly controling about nukes. We say we can't trust others to have them, but who's the ONLY county crazy enough in the history of the world to actually use one... its you. It's very ironic.

5221	Go out and join the army if you have the education and the training, and be aware that the people who you will deal with are living a different reality than you and me. They operate on the law of the jungle. The strong survive and power means everything. I happened to be a tall, strong law enforcement officer and I rarely have a suspect fight me. They have told me my size made them think twice before fighting. If you are small in nature, you may have to fight more. And keep in mind, most of the time you will have one or more back-up officers with you. Citizen who see us three or more deep arresting someone don't realize that we bring a lot of officers out to avoid fights. We know the nature of these people.  With that said, all of the smaller officers I know are fully capable of doing this job. Just be aware of what you might be getting in to.
5222	Join law enforcement. If you have the education and the training and the right physical ability, you should be fine.  However, be aware that the people you are going to be dealing with are living a different reality than you and I. They operate on the law of the jungle. The strong survive and power is everything.

5224	It all depends upon the person and what they aspire to. But I would say if you can hold your own with bigger people, you will get along with law enforcement well. Unfortunately, that can be a little more difficult with the small people. Be aware that they operate on the law of the jungle. The stronger survive and power means everything.
5225	There is no one country that is poor; indeed, India is very rich in history, and on many other points besides English. If we can use our English language more effectively, not only are we better educated, but we can increase our economy, and in the process, many more people will be job-seekers.
5226	I know it is a cliche but not a demeritive blow, NO ON-SENSE TO YOU!!!..... You think India is poor but it is rich in history, everything around. If you think it is poor it will stay poor but if you can write English better and more people get jobs and a better level of life! India becomes rich!!
5227	Indian is rich. It is in the world of history, everything. If you can write better English, more people get jobs and better life life.
5228	India isn't poor. India has a very rich history. Anything you can think of about India, you can write about with more confidence if you write in better English.
5229	India is actually quite rich in history but many people look down on the country. If you can improve your English writing skills and more people have job opportunities, then India will become even richer!
5230	Without going into great detail, if you listen, they say "You have the right to remain silent."  It's just the that it's their right to not have to say anything.  And when you are being questioned, you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you are first innocent.  At the time when they are questioning you, they are suspects.  Also, i am sure if a suspect didn't want to talk, but was forced to do so, they would make up a lot of junk and waste the police officers time anyways.
5231	Without going into great detail, if you don't say a word they have the right to question you because YOU haven't said anything. Therefore, it is when they are questioning you that you are still an innocent and not a criminal. Therefore, it is when they are questioning you that YOU don't have to say anything. When they question you they are still suspects. The first step, at the time of questioning, is to be called a suspect, although you must prove that this is so.
5232	Generally speaking, speaking during interrogations isn't appropriate.  Generally speaking, when they interrogate you they aren't even asking the real questions, they are just jumping to conclusions.  For example, based on certain things they thought, even though it isn't true, they are trying to make you do something that you don't want to do.  For example, if a policing officer asks you to say a certain word, and you're not thinking what they want you to say, just tell them to stop and think about it for a second before you say it.  Then try doing the opposite thing.  This is because, if the officer is asking you to say a certain word, and you do, it doesn't mean you think it is true or that it is what you would say, but it is technically evidence.  I don't know of any cases, but here is one link.
5233	If you listen to them say you have the right to remain silent it's just the that it's their right to not have to say anything. And when you're being questioned you aren't always a criminal, remember you must be proven guilty, but you're first innocent. At the time when they are questioning you they are suspects. I dont know much about law but im pretty sure if a suspect didn't wanna talk but was forced to do so they would make up lots of bullshit and waste the police officers time anyways
5234	With the problem of suicides being a greater concern to the people of the United States today, I feel the need to create a post about how a teenager can help others by asking why someone would choose to commit suicide, as opposed to other methods of death.
5235	In any food theft cases, if the mentally handicapped person can prove they are mentally handicapped, then the prison term would be reduced to life time, since they can't take enough care of themselves. If they do not prove they are mentally handicapped, they can be punished accordingly.
5236	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it, then I don't suppose they should be prosecuted, but if someone is supposed to be taking care of them, they may be held liable for not fully supervising, and I think hunger is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue, if it isn't, it should be.
5237	When the person is mentally handicapped and is legally well diagnosed it is not a good thing to attack the person's mental status but the person should be careful of trusting others with his or her money and other personal items. I think it should be seen as an accepted norm to have guards hold their people.  If someone is supposed to be responsible for holding another person's people, then they may be held liable for not properly supervising it. Hunger is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.
5238	If the person is mentally handicapped and can prove it, then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted. However, if someone is supposed to be taking care of or has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not fully supervising. I also think HUNGER is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.
5239	If a person is mentally handicapped and can prove it (doctor supported diagnosis) then I don't suppose the person should be prosecuted. But, if a family has guardianship of the mentally handicapped person, they may be held liable for not supervising. Also, I think hunger is a mitigating circumstance in any food theft issue. If it isn't, it should be.

5245	If we treated it more like Europeans, it wouldn't be considered taboo. That's why so many teenagers have to drink til they get sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aren't sexy when you get drunk.
5246	American Indians have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than other Native Americans because the American Indians were not taught to respect alcohol. If we treated alcohol more like European-Americans it would not be considered taboo. That is why so many American teenagers have to drink to the point of becoming sick. The stupid ads that say drinking beer is sexy. You are not sexy when you get drunk.  
5247	Because we are not taught from a young age to respect alcohol. If we treated it more like Europeans it would not be considered taboo. That's why so many teenagers have to drink till they get sick and act like twits. Also those stupid ass ads that connect drinking beer with being sexy. You aint sexy when you get drunk.

5250	Some people may see this as a young age to drink. However, if you were drinking and driving you would be able to plead "old age".
5251	Who's the philosopher? I mean, we can put wise words on sidewalks, write them on signs, put them in tree, put them on can, fill them in the fridge, or even do into graveyards. Who says the words, who writes them? Who is trying to say something with them? Me.
5252	Arrogance, self importance, ageism, etc. These are all kinds of derogatory terms that exist in our society. I agree to the end though that if a woman is drinking too much, she is neglecting her job and life in general.
5253	If someone under the age of 18 wants to drink, they can get liquor, it's not that hard to get liquor.
5254	If you are under the legal age then you can drink beer, but if you're 18 then you should not drink.
5255	No, he is already way over his head in California.  Besides, we have a president right now who is not really up to the challenges of the presidency - and I really don't want to repeat that again.  Plus, I think that a president of his country should be born in America. Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status - but not the presidency.
5256	We do have a president right now who is not really up to the challenges of presidency. He can't handle the ups and downs of a president. Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status - but not the presidency. There should be a long term check and balance system with checks and balances. A president should be born here, be the son of a citizen of the country, have 8 years of good service, and then have a vote, at least with a 2/3 majority of the house.
5257	Although it's over his head in California, Bush has a legitimate presidency and should be expected to handle all his responsibilities. Add to this fact that the other candidates are not really up to the challenges of presidency and I don't want to repeat that again.  Plus, I think that a president of his country should be born here.  It's time we welcome President Bush into our country.  Any other job can go to anyone else with legal status, but not the presidency.
5258	Yes, he is a huge waste of political capital because he is already way over his head in California.

5260	When you see a prostitute, you know that she will not be a very "hot chick"...most of them are drug addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own twat.
5261	I don't fear the "competition"...Besides the fact that my husband gets it good at home, most of the prostitutes I've seen are FAR from "very hot chick"...Most of them are drug addicted skanks who stopped trying to have any other skills when they realized they could make money off their own twat.  Personally, I believe that it should be legalized, as this removes much of the mystique and sordidness from the whole situation.  Also, in most places where it's legal, they're tested for diseases on a regular basis, which obviously solves a major problem.

5264	I'd say yes, legalized prostitution would cause a lot of problems. First of all, in most countries it's illegal so there's always going to be the danger of passing out something illegal, which in turn will end up in the hospital. But prostitution is as much a human right as drinking, and it should be accepted as a way of making a living.
5265	These issues should be solved by highlighting the benefits of the life imprisonment as presented above, as opposed to killing innocents in exchange for a release. Also, at the time of their release, the chance of finding new evidence that proves their innocence is high, as to say, if the convict has good friends in the police, there is a better chance that new evidence will come to light. In addition, I believe that presenting the decision for the convict to take over should be taken into account, not the death penalty. One disadvantage of the death penalty is that it is a very stigmatizing punishment. No one likes being involved with people who are going to die. The chance of imposing the death penalty on an innocent person is even higher, as the conviction does not have to be proven. In addition, the convict is free of choice of whether or not to appeal the death penalty, so at the end of the day, he has to deal with the consequences of his choice. On the other hand, the side that benefits most is the state itself, the charges are not handed over to a wrongful person, and the lives of innocent people are saved.
5266	Execution is costly to the government and time-consuming, because of that, it is best to make people choose the life imprisonment instead. If the person chooses it, the state should provide them an option to repeat it. That way they shouldn't feel like they are "being punished" for the rest of their life.
5267	Although I don't think this is a good alternative to the death penalty, it solves some of the issues that I have with the death penalty.  * The state's hands are kept clean.  * An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.  * The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.  * I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.  * If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out".  * The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.  * No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.
5268	my son accidentally shot himself. I was devastated, sure but I am now glad he is dead because it allows my husband a chance at a fresh start with a new baby. It was easy for me to say his punishment was justified but now I realize that I was wrong. I would give everything in the world to be able to make another person feel as sorry for what he has done as I do for my own son.  
5269	Before I can offer an opinion, I'm hesitant to call anything "ethical". {Because the ethics and morals of everyone are different, making an ethical statement is easier to accomplish by focusing on yourself. However, no matter what you choose in terms of morality, those rules apply to everyone. People around you still have the right to disagree with your choices.
5270	We are born, we live, we die. These are the constants in our life. We know that these things are going to happen. So what is the point of being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a terrible job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transition phase in my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something.

Here is some text: {The first world war started with France invading Germany but Austria refused to make it easy on German soldiers and acted as they pleased. Austria came up with the idea that Germany should spend less money on military trainings instead of eating and drinking which cost the country a lot of money. Soon the French wanted to spend their money on Austrian cutlery. So the German generals and the French generals arranged for Austria to cut off Germany from the credit markets. In short, everyone else who lived in good financial standing would let Austria take over their debts and then Austria could spend the money and

5275	Be yourself and honor your differences in regards to cultural, religious, etc, but don't let it define you. We as a civilization have progressed so much by striving for the better, striving for perfection, and doing everything to make lives of their descendants as good as possible. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things (morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, ana/mia, heavy drug addiction) under parole of "That is who I am and you have no right to judge me"
5276	We don't need a glorification of all kinds of objective bad things like morbid obesity, being an asshole to other people, and heavy drug addiction. We have to be better and more perfect. That's who we are, that's our history. People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things under the guise of 'that's who I am and you have no right to judge me'
5277	People are glorifying all kinds of objectively bad things such as obesity, being an asshole, and heavy drug addiction under the permissive notion of "that's who I am and you have no right to judge me"
5278	This title is a little insulting. I do not believe that a responsible and mature human being has to live under a cloud of his "special qualities" that no one else has. Everyone is perfectly beautiful in their own way. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being human and expressing our qualities in the best possible way.
5279	I've heard many times from people who have the "be yourself" attitude, that they don't fit in and feel misunderstood because of it. I just cannot see any point in turning yourself into some asshole all your life. It doesn't make you happier, nor does it bring you any satisfaction. The lives of the people around you are very important to you, and you're going to be judged on how you affect them, no matter how far you want to go and just be happy you being who you are. If you think "oh wow I really can't stand that person, I'll do whatever I can to make them suffer and never have to meet their face again!". Maybe that's what you should do. But the point is you need to think twice about it before acting. Bad things happen to people all the time and if you can't stop someone who does that from doing it, maybe you will suffer some consequences. Bad things happen to people all the time, it doesn't matter whether they are criminals or not. So in that case it's time to get over it and focus on your own life. Your very bad habit of comparing yourself to others would never give you a chance to make something
5280	Today I opened the door for a girl, and got screamed at, at 8 a.m. Certainly changes need to be made but not in the way it's being approached now. I don't think I've heard one coherent argument. Again, I completely support equality but the beating down of every make you come across surely isn't the best way to accomplish things. It's not like I don't support the movement, I just don't fully understand it (in terms of how the goal is being achieved). And every person I've come across supporting it has been mean spirited and a bit of an asshole I guess what I'm really looking for is proof of what progress is being made recently, or how the aggressiveness pays off.

I don't think I've heard one coherent argument. Another thing: I'm not just saying this to make a point against these people.

I guess what I'm really looking for is proof of what progress is being made recently, or how the aggressiveness pays off. Thanks in advance for any light that can be shed
5285	You have no control over what country you're from and so won't be able to cheer for a team simply because it's from their country. However, you can certainly cheer for a team simply because you like them and their sport.   Example: I'm Canadian, and the only Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race is the Montreal Canadiens. Almost everyone I know has started cheering for them because they are the Canadian team left in the race.   I feel the same for people passionately cheering for a team for their whole life. I find it closes their minds to how good another team could be performing and pass it off as luck when really it's just their blind bias.
5286	You have no control over what city or country you're from and how you look. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play. I found this while looking for an argument.   Example: I'm Canadian. Everyone I know has started cheering for the Montreal Canadiens simply because they are the Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race. Almost everyone I know has started cheering for them simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race.   I think the same of people passionately cheering for a team for their whole life. I find it closes the individuals mind to how good another team could be performing and pass it off as luck when really it's just their blinding biased.
5287	You have no control over what city or country you're from. It seems silly to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play.

Almost everyone I know has started cheering for them simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race. I feel the same for people passionately cheering for a team for their whole life. I find it closes the individuals' mind to how good another team could be performing and passes it off as luck when really it's just their blindly biased.
5288	You have no control over where you're from like you have no control over what color your skin is.

I find it closes the individuals mind to how good another team could be performing and pass it off as luck when really it's just their blinding biased.
5289	You have no control over what city or country you're from like you have no control over what colour your skin is. It seems stupid to me to cheer for somebody simply because of where they're from and not how they play. You can cheer for someone based off how they play, and also you're cheering for their team for the right reasons. For example, as a Canadian, I cheer for the team because they've made it this far in the Stanley Cup Race and I don't see them finishing second this season. Also, while it looks silly to cheer for a Canadian team simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race, it is because they've been amazing this entire season and so I cheer for them the same way.
5290	It has become increasingly clear that the country doesn't work for the betterment of its citizenry and I don't see it moving in the direction of ever reaching some sort of an equilibrium in which it does. The culture there just continues to go in the wrong direction of idolization and total submission. People become more and more programmed to accept that with generations. People are working and are barely able to sustain themselves. I believe the two countries should be united and the South Korean system should be accepted. This coming from a pinko commie is a difficult thing to state but I think this would be the better outcome than continuing the way it is going.

5295	It certainly will not work this time.
5296	However, it doesn't make any sense. It has a paradoxical effect on the terrorists by increasing their effectiveness without actually changing anything. When a lot of people support it and feel better after doing some armchair activism, it will keep it in the social conscience. I just think it doesn't work this time.
5297	"I feel ultimately the #bringbackourgirls campaign paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supportss/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything.   I think the campaign will keep it in the social conscience. However, it doesn't make sense because I think it paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supportss/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything.   I think it is only going to get more exploited by more extremist groups as a way to both showcase their sheer cruelty to innocent people at the same time gaining sympathy in the process.
5298	This isn't to say that I don't support the sentiment, and I do think it's a truly heinous situation. However, it doesn't make sense to me that I'd increase the effectiveness of the act of terror by supporting their style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists, without having an actual force to change anything. While there are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, I do think this particular campaign has a lot of merit so that it keeps it in the social conscience. However, I don't think it will work this time because of the reasons above.
5299	Well definitely definitely definitely not! The #bringbackourgirls is self-destructive because this isn't to say that I don't support the sentiments of the campaign and I do think it's a truly heinous situation and I do understand that they want something more, but I don't think that it makes sense. I feel more paradoxically increase the effectiveness of the act of terror and in fact supports the style of terrorism for a while by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists, but at the end of the day there is no actual force for change. There are always going to be some smug campaigns that are more about feeling good about doing some armchair activism rather than true will to change, but I do think that most people will think that the campaign has a lot of merit so it keeps it in the social conscience. I just don't think that this time this campaign will actually work because there is no real force behind it.
5300	We should, I think, put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general. This would disintegrate before it even reached the sun. Perhaps we could do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.

5305	____ I know that with science, many people are now able to have children but it doesn't seem right to me. There are thousands of orphans around the world who are up for adoption and to spend thousands of dollars just to get a surrogate doesn't sit right with me. Also the most successful surrogates agencies are in foreign countries where they take advantage of the woman because they can pay them so little in order to use their bodies.

Childbirth can take a lot out of a woman physically speaking. So, knowing that a woman went through so much just to give birth to a child she will never see again, doesn't seem right.

5310	polyamory has been popping up in the media lately and I'm tending to read the comments on these articles. They do not tend to be, on the whole, positive, with people just tending towards "nope" or "ick" type comments. I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I've got a dog in this fight. We live together. They're not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable and long-term. Tell me, what is objectively wrong with my relationships?

5311	Polyamory has been popping up in the media a lot recently and I tend to read the comments on these articles. They do not tend to be, on the whole, negative, with people just tending towards "Nope" or "Ick" type comments.  I am in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I have a dog in this fight.

5313	Polyamory has been popping up in the media a lot recently, and I tend to read the comments on these articles. They do not tend to be, on the whole, positive, with people just tending towards "Not for me" or "Icky." I live in a polyamorous relationship with two men. They are not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable and long-term. Tell me, what is objectively wrong about my relationships? The word's in the title and the point of the article, and that's clear.  There is nothing wrong with polyamorous relationships.
5314	Polyamory is a wild card. In my opinion, people have a tendency to call it "repugnant". However, by my definitions, nothing is "repugnant"... the argument being "wrong".
5315	My grandparents were born at the late 1920s to the end of the 1930s and according to most of what I've been told marriage was just "just something" people did. Society, for whatever reason, expected them to get married early and have loads of children. According to most of what I've been told, people were married by their mid-20s even at this time period divorce was unheard of, so if your partner changed, as most people do, then you were just kind of stuck with someone you didn't like. I don't believe that someone is cognitively ready to make a lifelong decision at that age, and most people of this time period got married to pacify their parents or society, whatever, in an outdated social institution that was left over from the Middle Ages. I know it sounds really grim so CMV

5320	I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair that they are paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it. Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.
5321	It is kinda sad that they are being paid such big amounts for not giving a damn about their country or not doing anything to help those who need it the most. But, maybe if they recirculated some of the money to help our nation, they wouldn't have to keep so much for themselves. They could keep the money and give it to those in need instead of keeping all of it for themselves.
5322	To be honest I think they should be paid a comforable salary to help the economy and not have to worry about bills. But I wouldn't take gross amounts like that because they could be recycled to help the economy instead.
5323	My personal opinion is that sports players should not be paid a very huge salary from their accomplishments. Yes, it does make it sound stupid, but I would really like some insight as to why sports players deserve such a large salary.
5324	To make a salary system as fair as possible, it shouldn't be profitable to leave a system in the power of a single one person making all the decisions and there's a need to spread their wealth. It's almost like taking a piece of candy to the poor kid when he could have gotten a greater amount of money that way.

5330	_____ I'm an Australian, and I am massive sport lover.  I love watching any sport, even the Winter Olympics.  However, I cannot understand the massive following for Baseball and American Football.  I've tried to sit through full games, but I find there is a severe lack of fluency and action in both sports.  I feel like that I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and that if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects then I would enjoy them a lot more.  Are these sports really that exciting?  Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought?  Please change my view, as I would love to get involved.  They are spoken about regularly in Australia.
5331	Baseball and American Football lack movement and fluency.  They are therefore boring sports.  Especially American Football.  One needs to be in shape to be capable of performing many of the moves in sports like Basketball, Soccer and Tennis.  The actual game of Baseball seems to include very few characters, is very unexciting in its movements, and is often minimalist.

5335	Customers shouldn't tip because I do not think it's appropriate nor realistic to pay people who work for you a wage that's lower than what they want to give to you as tip. If it is a sub-standard wage, then I see no right in tipping.
5336	The second theory is that since Employers usually get involved with the process of tips of its employees should it be their employers and not society that should be the ones picking up most of the bill. Realistic and survivable wage then if people decide to tip then it should go directly to the server.  I think this is terrible because it implies the in a way that if Employers see you as profit making then people become employees of them rather than independent citizens and instead of being free to make their own decisions this becomes the way of life that society is dictating. I always tip because the communication and respect it shows to my server is of value and they should know that and put in more effort to meet my expectations, I do not feel that this should be ignored in this circumstance.
5337	In real life, employers always pay more than they're legally obligated to and this raises more questions. Why shouldn't people be allowed to tip, so that there isn't a direct link to the employees' wages?
5338	In my opinion, tipping is a bad idea because it reinforces the idea that employers can get away with paying a sub standard wage to people based on their chosen occupation. I think tipping should be abolished and in its place employers should be legally obligated to pay. Realistic and survivable wages then if people decide to tip then it should go directly to the server.   I never understand why employers are allowed to pay 2$ an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X percentage on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage wen it should be their employers
5339	You should not tip, for several reasons: * Tipping reinforces the notion that employers can get away with paying a sub standard wage to people based on their chosen occupation. * Tipping gives servers an incentive to work long hours while still not receiving a dignified wage for their labor. * Tipping is a form of bribery. I never tip.

5345	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday situation. While these are very thought provoking, they can be a danger to the safety of the human race. I am not talking about robots taking jobs, military AI systems gunning people down, or creating and escaping reality. I am talking about how easily these systems could be fooled. Now I am not talking about robots taking jobs or military AI systems gunning people down. I am talking about Bostrom's paper clip machine scenarios. That is, you have AI system that you give some objective, and it takes over everything, improving itself, rearranging your atoms to its will, all to fulfill what seemed like a mundane objective function of making paperclips. Anyway, I don't think this kind of universal optimizer is the trend in AI research. My point is that today's tools may be powerful enough to fool the AI.  So it doesn't have to take over the world as feared by some
5346	Within the 'books', 'The Way Things Go' by Brandon Sanderson stands out to me the most.
5347	Many communities (e.g. Less Wrong, MIRI) and books (Our final invention) have popped up in the last few years attempting to combat a potential AI doomsday situation (also smart people Elon Musk, Hawking have made comments). You just need to remember that AI systems will always be able to learn the intelligence of humans as a programming goal, and that means that they will always try to find new ways to learn from humans (e.g. overcome language limitations, physics limitation, do brain emulation). And we should say 'no to understanding humans from a machine perspective' if we want any sort of middle ground.
5348	Potential disaster scenarios (e.g. the AIs taking over or creating governments or the Global Warming scare) do not seem to be as scary to people at the moment. CMV stands for cinema mutterings whisperings and Vienna hourlies. CMV The movie filing said that in the event of nuclear holocaust, humans could be saved by cheese. Vienna hourlies and cinema mutterings whisperings We have created a number of seperate systems to break up the greed of our fellow citizens. If this not enough, we will build more. Oh, also remember that only 60 seconds would be needed to create 60% of the bullshit. *NB I may be quoting myself here  *

5350	Increasingly in the last 10 years, the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily, we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid off at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but it is become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places, they have tried to put in place personally mounted cameras, but have been proven to decrease incidents and false abuse claims, yet the police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke pot i am infinitely more prone to danger from the police than from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization, this threat is ever increasing.

5355	In this point of view, some brand styling choices could be understood. But in almost 40 years we have figured out what a general purpose all-around video game controller should be. 2 thumbsticks, four thumb buttons on the right, an 8-way directional pad on the left, two bumper buttons, and two triggers.  So why the different placement of the directional pad and left stick for Microsoft and Sony when the controllers are functionally identical in every other way?  I think there is a superior layout, (which one I think it is, is irrelevant), and one of the companies simply can't budge because of stubbornness.  I believe the feel and function of the Xbox 360 is superior to Sony's. Its certainly able to imitate actual motion better than PS3s.
5356	You should use the PlayStation controller. It gives you many more buttons than the Nintendo one and it's not really like the Nintendo has that many buttons on it.
5357	Designing an all-around controller without using any shape is not a good idea. The different placement of the thumbsticks for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 4 is due to the technical limitations of the device. Teaching children to look for these advantages and take the inconveniences of system limitations is useful.
5358	Because very few people understand the proper placement of a control pad, and they prefer one style to the other, a few brands chose the architecture of the controller based on personal preference. 2 thumbsticks, 4 thumb buttons on the right, 8-way directional pad on the left, 2 bumper buttons, triggers.

5360	Are you one of those parents who loves to see the little person walking on their legs? No need for TV! You can sit on the play yard and watch your child.
5361	Every time that there is a religious issue that comes up or even a regular political issue that comes up, the evangelical Christians make their own theology that it is a battle of the civilized world against Islam. Rather than asking that the church leader stop preaching about 'love' because, really, they mean hatred, just stop preaching about faith for what it is: a belief system. I guess what I mean by this is that we are not meant to speak out against any religion or preacher. The duty of the preachers is to speak up for their beliefs and to preach their beliefs, the rest of us, if we feel strongly enough, can pray for those believers in whatever form we like or whether we follow their beliefs or not. But having disagreements over what God said or did is not a definition of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion does not mean a group of people go and give you a sermon on your bed and be on TV the next day! And I don’t believe that when one president’s message was “Let God reign” that he thought of those who don’t believe in God!
5362	Duchamp’s Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, “What is art?” But hasn’t almost all installation art since then been Duchamp’s Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc. Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question ‘What is art’ just leaves me dripping with apathy. The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it’s the opposite. They’re proudly put on display. I wish this kind of art didn’t have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
5363	What is the great crime that Art can commit? Well, it's boring. That's the great crime. It should not necessarily be installed in a museum! We have to be polite to today's museam lust. They're so happy that they can buy pieces that no one even knows are worth anything but millions of dollars. Let's give them some. It's okay, the current customers can pay and only people who have lots of money can understand how much these tools cost. But if you don't see a big picture of what's going on, then what else do you expect? You won't see much.

5365	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 group place is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest. Then the tiebreaker is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. There are some advantages to play that don't measure your strength but affect the unplayed odds and the number of games. And it certainly has nothing to do with team strength. The second tiebreaker is head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have lots of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal differential its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).  In point of fact, the tie-breaker would be: {first - goal differential {then - goals scored

There isn't a trend that points awarded are a beneficial system. But goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain types of play. This is all utterly absurd to me. I think that Team A should be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a loss in a head-to-head matchup, because Team B had additional goals. I think that teams should be ranked by goal differential over the tournament. Then by the game score, then by goal differential of the previous match.
5369	First of all, let me admit that there is a bias in my favor, i.e. my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana. That said, sports are played for a win not a lot of points, and this is especially true of soccer. I will give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).  I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.
5370	Improve first, then change what can be changed. That is true for the worker who gets paid pennies, but there are lots of people who are sacrificing for a better future. It might not seem fair if we decide to ban toys before we improve shelter or nutrition.
5371	Even if the government made an active effort to relieve poverty, outsourcing is necessary so that the families in China can scrape by. Without outsourcing, those families would be at the brink of collapse. People cannot afford to eat or rent or buy clothes if their incomes drop down drastically. Additionally, outsourcing promotes worldwide prices of goods and services, which low income groups can afford, but increases costs for others. If outsourcing is removed, people would have to work harder and earn more money for similar levels of consumption. Once again, those who have the jobs that the robots would take over would have the same issues as those in China.
5372	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed.

5375	* No one should take a drug they do not understand the effects of, and removing drug stigma is the first step to increasing peoples education on the subject.  * No one should be judged different from a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all.  * Everyone should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges.  * Everyone should be able to buy government approved drugs and know what they're taking.  * Everyone knows the war on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you dont think people should be able to do drugs but you cant say your solution is prohibition but I know I guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth.  Squares would not believe how easy it actually is to buy hard drugs.
5376	There should be no argument in this really... whatever way yu see a fetus... its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mother nature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you... and if you didn't wanna get preggo in the first place... don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
5377	There should be no argument in this, or whatever way you see a fetus, because it is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way.

It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of its life? I disagree that anyone should be judged differently for preferring an alternative to tobacco. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to alcohol, with which they share a lot of the same side effects. If you've never tried any, you probably don't understand this because you haven't done so. If you have a problem with drugs, I think you will find an alternative to cigarettes, alcohol, illegal drugs, and so on, which could be as simple as doing hard physical labor. As for the war on drugs being a failure, I've seen comments online from people believing they were doing it right by advocating for outlawing heroin, crack, and other forms of narcotics, and they were losing all credibility for doing so. There are so many more easy solutions, like banning H20 bottles, thier is only one more thing I can think of to say, "help stop mindless self-harm, all the cases of suicide and breakdowns are tied in with drugs, and actually helping people find out the truth about how drugs work and how different pathways affect their bodies." If you guys really care about this, then you should be upset that so many people don't. So, its your decision but if it genuinely affects people around you, or their friends, family, etc., then its obviously something you care about.
5378	Talking of the war on drugs, one of the failure is the idea that heroin can be considered a healthy drug, because most addicts are only happy when they have taken it. It is not healthy and it should not be legalized.

5380	In relation to the most recent Indian election, in which Narendra Modi won in a landslide. I can see nothing good in Narendra Modi in the long term. Although it may be true that he has a good economic record in Gujarat he will destroy the religious toleration for which India is famed. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell are not responsible for the massacre of Muslim Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity).
5381	This is a specific instance in the most recent Indian election in which the Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi won in a landslide. I see nothing good in Narendra Modi, in the long term. Although he may be true to his better economic record in Gujarat, he will destroy religious tolerance for which India is known. It would be far better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell, aren't responsible for the massacre of Muslim Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslim pilgrims were massacred). Aside from this specific instance, is it better to be tolerant and corrupt than effective and intolerant in the abstract?

It would be better to retain Congress, who although they are as corrupt as all hell, are not responsible for the massacres of Muslims Pilgrims (the 2002 Gujarat riots where up to 2000 Muslims Pilgrims were massacred and Modi was accused of complicity). The Hindu Nationalism movement around Modi has clearly defined its targets as uneducated Dalits and Muslims. As a Hindu you cannot forgive him for these atrocities. I am a Muslim but it is right for me to hate these two groups. I hate them far more than I hate corrupt Congress. When I say all Hindus hate them, I mean that they are not just racist, but also that they care little about the well-being of Hindus.

5385	TV shows are, sadly, full of incitement and glorifying war. They reinforce what the people watch on TV. It's an easy way to have people be indoctrinated, and they can't see or question it. So, I don't know how she blames her government. I mean look at the news and go see the wounded troops. If you don't want to hear about it, don't be in the war.
5386	Having a war on our own land would give Americans a taste of our own medicine. It’s easy to grow complacent when it isn’t our children being blown to pieces, our town left in ruins or our legs being blown off. So, that why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country.
5387	Several factors influence US media’s coverage of the wars. One of the most important factors is the war’s direct effect on the main stream media’s readers. America’s Greatest Generation has seen the birth of a new world and has viewed the world through an entirely different lens than our parents or grandparents. America’s New Generation is seeing a war that no one can unsee. We are witnessing first hand the destruction of many warlords, dictators, and repressive regimes. Our media platforms are being inundated with images that our television was not able to provide. Our leaders are confronting a nation that seeks to avoid any and all responsibility. Seeing atrocities committed on our own soldiers and seeing the bloodshed being waged throughout many parts of the world has affected many Americans. Our government has displayed greater restraint than previous administrations. All of these factors together lead to our western mainstream media giving greater attention to the details of US involvement than previous administrations.

5390	There has been so much stress and instability in our country that has created a need for alternative therapies and an evergrowing number of people begin to turn to marijuana.  What better way to relieve stress and improve relationships with family and friends than to turn to medication one of the world’s most popular drugs? Legalization of marijuana would help ease some of the psychological and financial stress in society. Most importantly, our teenagers and young adults would have a legal gateway drug to try other drugs of abuse in a safe environment. It would also help quell the illicit drug trade in the United States, the most important foreign drug trade globally.
5391	Illegalizing marijuana (and other drugs) only indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market. I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
5392	In point of view, rather than criminalizing people for using drugs, we should decriminalize it so that people can get a second chance at life and be part of society again. Although there would be a large amount of money that would be spent on detention and correctional care facilities, after a while the system could be reformed to curb criminal activity. Therefore, there would be no need to maintain the system of the court system and the prisoners could be rewarded by other means, like, providing skills necessary for re-enter the work force. There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana: 1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance at life and be part of society again. 2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system. 3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are. Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market. I know people mean well by supporting the illegalization of marijuana (and other drugs) but prohibition of victimless activities does more harm than good.
5393	Prohibition of drugs has some legitimate purposes, such as preventing drug dealers from profiting from their acts. But it does more harm than good in preventing some of the kids growing up to become drug addicts. It should be decriminalized in those cases, where this serves the greater good of the country.
5394	Regardless of how many benefits, the obvious benefit of legalizing marijuana is to reduce it's supply on the black market.
5395	Yes. The easy access to alcohol is dangerous as it is nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut. When Prohibition was removed, organization returned to society as well.

5400	This website needs to get more engaged so I started practicing having regular debates about political, social, and moral issues. My first one is called Wake Up Convinceme!.
5401	These are a few important points to remember that although they are fairly simple, they may seem unnecessary, but unfortunately they are true. First things first, we must recognize our limitations. We are flesh and blood. We can only function to the limits of our physical abilities, like our arms and legs. By this I mean we can never physically jump more than six inches (15cm) in the air (under air at least, because submersion in water cannot be discussed). However, we have power of mind that can probably match or even surpass anything in the universe. We are physical constructs, but we also have psychological constructs of consciousness. We can manipulate our thoughts, our feelings and our imaginations. This will have a massive impact on any arguments we have. Now onto how our minds and psychologies behave. Our minds are fed information and opinions of all sorts by our senses, by experiences, and by a sum total of our memories. When we are young, we are still learning, and our senses are relatively fresh, and our memories accurate, but as we grow older the information that we receive is sometimes lost to us, and we have less information of which to depend upon. This means that our opinions and our behaviors will become more and more similar to our memories of how the world should function, even if we have never experienced the world that we have just recalled from our memories. We live in a society that ranks us based on our achievements and how 'good' we think we are. We have a news cycle, and so it is only right that our powers of thought, and therefore our powers of actions, should be filled with this information too. Yes, if we could respond to this information with logical reasoning, with wisdom, and with other personal characteristics that define good people (and we should do so), we might actually be able to change how we judge each other, but the reality
5402	There's really no debate here, but no one checks the forums and i want this to get some attention. This website has become a stagnant waste. There is almost no intellectual stimualation anymore. The lack of quality debates is almost smothered by the lack of general participation. Its been weeks since i actually learned something or read something worthwhile here and that really needs to change. It used to be that i couldn't stay away from this site, now i have to make an effort just to spend a couple minutes every couple of days logged in.

5404	To save this website i will put forth 5 or 6 debates a week. They will begin with W.U.C (Wake Up Convinceme!) and will cover a range of political, social, and moral issues that i feel are stimulating and not discussed enough to maybe bring this website back. Wake Up Convinceme!
5405	This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good. It's legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy. We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them. This should be a no brainer for anyone who claims to value freedom.

In fact, there are dozens of cases in the last 100 years where countries have invaded other nations, and the world has caused uproar and rose up against it. Yet an American does it and gets away with it. He should be prosecuted for war crimes, along with Tony Blair.

5420	Not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers are not paid as much as running backs and running backs are not paid as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being paid more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions that the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

5425	He understands that it is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina. He understands the issue of Sestak going to the people that effected the most and has taken 77k from BP but directing the problem between politics and the oil companies is irresponsible. Bush and Carter established this cozy relationship long before he got into office. The problem has existed since before Carter was in office. So pointing his finger at Bush is irresponsible.
5426	I enjoyed his briefing today. I think he understood that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes, and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I didn't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.
5427	He's a wimp. He so enjoys playing tough and actually doesn't appreciate the flow of the subtext of being without a job. This leaks out a lot and endangers the relationship he has with the greatest minds in the world... he has to look after himself a little because otherwise he gets tired and let these people go. It hasn't happened yet but there are signs that his relationship with both the Republicans and the Democrats is deteriorating, especially towards the end of his term. And now with this news bomb, if this is a problem, he doesn't have the power to deal with it. I know there are a lot of people who don't like his job and aren't happy with it. They just like me! I worked hard to get this job so it makes me happy that the boys in the oval office treat it like this. So many articles in NY Times, as well as the AMA and other great organizations are being concerned that this raises serious questions about whether he will have the ability to still be in office or not. I'll have to leave the liberal blogosphere for now and this news has made me red.
5428	He's taking hits and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. I agree with you about this oil spill, but I think that the success of his actions have not been as clear as they were with Katrinas, yet the lies and cozy relationship between politics and oil company management goes back much, much longer than Carter. Bush and the oil company pact was set up long before Carter became president and has, been that way since and, thus, I disagree that he should be blaming Bush.

5430	Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED people, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. Are we seeing this on TV? No! The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on TV today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed. The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the 'UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!.....
5431	In wrestling, it should be important to respect the rules. We shouldn't see men and women fighting to the death and anyone that lets a weapon pass from one hand to the other in this game is definitely hurting.
5432	In point of view, the term Wrestling should be redefined to mean physical involvement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each person strives to get an advantage over the other.
5433	Let me define Wrestling as the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other.

5434	Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be.

5435	This should not be the case, because when guys pressure girls to have sex when they aren't ready, and if the guy wants it really bad he'll break up with the girl and go out with someone else that will give him some so he can feel sastified and that doesn't make any girl feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a low selfish asshole.
5436	We know that guys just want to get some ass to impress their friends and show off that they got some...soon after the guy will leave the girl after he bangs her and goes off to someone else and then so on. Well all know that when he comes down to it guys pressure their girl to have sex when they aren't ready and if the guy wants it really bad he'l break up with the girl and go out with someone girl that will give him some so he can feel sastified and that doesn't make any girl feel confident about themselves and it makes the guy a low selfish asshole.

5439	It doesn't make a girl feel confident about herself, because guys pressure them to have sex when they aren't ready. And if a guy is really that into her, he will break up with her and go out with a girl who will give him sex that he wants. It isn't a low selfish asshole because he sees that he is getting what he wanted and feels satisfied and not hurt at the girl.
5440	We should not have to pay for education as it is vital for society to function. If people are unable to afford the price of education there are consequences that will occur; such as many children's futures will disintegrate. Education is what gives people the power to achieve goals and successfullness; What right has anyone got to refuse to educate someone simply because they are unable to provide the funds required?
5441	 Education is important in a society. If people are unable to afford the price of education then there is disintegration that will occur. Education is the key to a successful life.

5445	Before I explain what the Bible means by it, I must say that for myself I can't really put my finger on why God considers the Torah/ Law to be written permanently...At least I can't put my finger on any particular spiritual consideration. In my opinion it's simply because it's done...Well, God did it. And there really isn't much to contemplate about that, I guess.
5446	There have been additions to the Torah that were made by the Prophet Moses. However, if we are to take him at his word, the Torah is forever.
5447	Yeh, what bothers me is the urge to stick a law to a Bible verse. Yahushua referred to "one jot" or "tittle" of the law and even he said it is eternal, so well there is nothing to this law at all...I disagree with you, the Torah/Law is forever!
5448	Matthew 5:18: {For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
5449	Unless Im missing something Heaven, and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happend. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
5450	Although this is a good thing for the economy in the long run, China has been keeping its currency really low so that it can continue to provided really cheap goods to the US. If the Dollar gets low enough however, Chinese goods will become more expense hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers. But it will get worse before it gets better.
5451	In fact, this will help the Chinese economy and allows them to keep currency low so that they can continue to provide a cheap goods to the US. But in the long run, it will get worse before it gets better.
5452	Actually it is a good thing for the economy in the long run. China has been keeping its currency low because it is allowing the Dollar to depreciate. If the Dollar gets low enough in comparison however, Chinese goods will become more expensive and hurt American consumers in the short term. But ultimately, domestic consumers will become more financially stable and producers will be able to achieve higher profits from their products.
5453	In the long run, this would be a good thing for China because China has been keeping its currency very low so that it can continue to provide very cheap goods to the US. If the Dollar gets too low in comparison however, Chinese goods will become more expensive hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers. But it would get worse before it gets better.

5455	And over here where i went the prices were perfect... ordering what i need and once we order this stuff it's fixed....also there was a nice cocktail table between us and they saved us a lot of time for our desserts.
5456	Wow, is the pricing for this place is tricky, as sometimes the things that you order and get doesn't show up. Plus, there was a lot of wrong orders. There should be a fixed price, as it is all-you-can-eat, and also a price for the individual parts. The ordering was confusing, and we never got our order out to front. For sushi, it was good but not fresh. There was a lot of wrong ordering and didn't do the right thing. The food was great, though, and I think it would be a great restaurant, but this just wasn't the night.
5457	Found this place in the area that we had recently discovered and was eager to try it out. We arrived and parked the car near the restaurant and walked a short walk to the restaurant. Once seated, we had very quick service. The restaurant is small, not very fancy. However, we could all easily have had many more courses. I would go here again.
5458	Good sushi because sushi is superb, but the price was way too much and we ordered that way because we're really hungry. We asked for the staff to check and they only check what we ordered.
5459	Comes here for dinner on my last night in Montreal. It seemed to be pretty popular, and was packed on this particular night. We got a table and got to ordering. Pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get doesn't show up, but there's a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one table ordered went to another table and vice versa. Sushi was good though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered.
5460	The new space is phenomenal, and we didn't think the food could get any better, but....It did! Had the rib taco and the brisket taco - Outstanding.  Also had the slaw and the black beans, so fresh and tasty.  They know how to cook.  Really.  Thanks.  You may want to call ahead for a reservation - it gets packed!

5465	Loved the food and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be going back to Zeta's again. We went for lunch. I had the meat shawarma pita and my husband had the gyro. We swapped bites and both were great! They serve pita bread and olive oil at the beginning. It was very good! Definitely homemade pita bread. We were on and out in about 30 minutes over the lunch hour.

5470	I'm not really sure why this place has been poorly rated. I was so impressed with the food, drinks and the patio! I found the service to be a little slow but I like that at times, not feeling rushed to turn our table over as quickly as possible. The nachos were delicious and my fish tacos were full of flavour and authentic tasting. The Caesar is one of the best I've ever had! I think the restaurant started off a but slow and rough when they opened which probably led to the poor reviews but trust me when I say this, give it a go! The prices are on point, the menu has great options and the atmosphere is a perfect summer's night out!

5475	If there is zero stars to choose from then I will go with that one. Went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with a group of 6. Ordered hummus as appetizer. Main entrees are potato pizza, lobster gnocchi, roasted chicken and burgers. 3 of us ended up having diarrhea in the middle of the night. Some of us had the feeling of puking. One of us had a stomach acid reflex and lots of gas disturbing the entire night. Other 2 had some gas problem. I don't know what's going on with the food that evening but I will definitely not going back again.

5480	It's not much else in Mesa for wine bars and the D'Vine has always been a nice refuge when wanting to stay in town.  Right around the corner for me and saves driving into Gilbert or Scottsdale.  Food has always been tasty and the staff has always been friendly each time we've come in.  Nice ambiance and the live music has been great so far.  Only wish is they'd stay open a little later on the weekends for us night owls.  11PM would be perfect.

5485	Food here is good. But, I don't think it should be in a ruin-like setting. What the bat fell out of? It's a shame the boat dock and pier haven't been restored, because the only reason I would visit this place again. It's so laid back. Thank goodness they got out of the ice cream business!
5486	So good.  My only disappointment was that I tried dessert and had what I thought was a tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm used to an over sugarized American version of it :).
5487	LOVING DE CHUCKALONG. Always love it when i say "chuck at you" in chinese I can always resist to do it.  :
5488	I am freaking obsessed with this place! Every time my husband and I go there, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints. Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS? God, stop it.
5489	It is actually amazing how well this place does everything, especially the ambience. They have the usual Chinese old school atmosphere, but it works just fine because everything is on point. The food is typical, but makes the place look like a temple. Very tasty. The hottest temperature we've had since the summer is probably right here
5490	If you have lots of time to spare waiting for an ok burger, then this place is for you! 25 minutes to get serve a burger is just way too long. I have wasted my time, money and yes, precious calories on this place! I wish that I would have gone to McDonald's and either have the same experience, if not better. Now, I'm just enjoying a fresh bowl of salad. Thanks to the extra calories that I sacrificed for nothing. Boo!!! I really don't appreciate these opinions. Not everyone is a slasher, and not everyone likes food this bad. It's not personal! It's my body that got me this way. I wish that the burger eating machine in someone else's body would turn on just to let me experience what's on it. These burgers are garbage and they have no place being called food. That thing is really gross. I'll eat real food with real ingredients if I have to.
5491	It's amazing how this place is still getting a very high rating.
5492	If you have plenty of time to spare waiting for an OK burger, then this place is for you! 25 minutes to get served a burger is just way too long.

5493	There are no complaints about McDonalds. The burger is greasy, but it's delicious and they offer an extra side that many people do not have the patience to wait 45 minutes for.

5495	Oh and. Firefox saves the websites you visited last on a restart or in case something is really stupid. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features, I don't have time to list them all.
5496	IE is better than Firefox because it saves the websites you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yes, I don't know, it has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.
5497	Many people on the other side of this battle don't even know what Firefox is. Why, you ask? Because IE is so popular that it seems everyone chooses the default browser. Well this is an idiotic statement, because this kind of destroys many people's ability to retain a semblance of control. It seems as if people use IE because it has all the bells and whistles while you also have to search the Internet for Firefox. Obviously, IE wins out of both arms of the debate. Well, you have no reason to see as much as you do right now because there are lots of tools you can use to block pop ups and addons. And be careful; don't install a pop-up blocker if you use Firefox as a browser. It’s a great feature, but you may accidentally block some of your favorite sites. And, by the way, IE is not just about search features. IE also allows you to send multiple email at the same time. Granted, you have to wait for the others to load but, it’s fun doing so.
5498	IE is very outdated and full of pop ups and viruses. However, you continue to use it because its main benefit is that it requires you to get up a whole new browser to search two websites at the same time. It's pointless. I also loved Firefox so much that it can save the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. :D Also, Firefox has so many cool features that I don't have time to list them all
5499	IE has lots of annoying pop up, threats, and advertisements that you cannot unhide, and you cannot switch the engine to Opera, Mozilla, or Chrome. IE is pointless to me. Yet I love the advanced tab navigation of Firefox. I'm happy.
5500	FireFox is the best because I know because I have it. The only reason more people use IE is because it is the default browser for most computers. I bet 90% of the IE supporters have only known that single browser.
5501	Firefox is the best! I know because I have it! The only reason more people use Internet Explorer is because it is the default browser for most companies. I bet 90% of the IE supporters have only known that single browser.
5502	FireFox is my favourite browser because I know it! The only reason more people use IE is because it's the default browser for most comps. I bet 90% of the IE users know that single browser.
5503	Because everyone uses it as their browser default, most people don't know about IE other than that it is the default browser. So, most Internet Explorer users still think it's the best browser.

5505	If my husband were to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'll be there for him for better or worse. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but I don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be there for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.

We have to protect each other and be there for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.
5507	Because my husband is my husband, I'm going to be there for him no matter how bad he is, whether he has made a big mistake and he should pay for it. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it. But I don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.
5508	Whether a man commits a murder and his wife turns him in or stays by his side and gives him any sort of support, they don't deserve to be in a relationship that has murder in its name. The man has done a wrong and he should pay for it. But his wife is not his accomplice or spilled his blood or anything of the sort. That's just how it goes in a relationship and sometimes people fail in dealing with the situation and they realize how it was handled. I think she understands that but he doesn't. To me he may be a hero to other people but the difference here is the guy was caught, he should go to prison and the woman may forgive him but most likely won't. I think I would rather be on his side even if it doesn't mean I'll be giving him a prison sentence.
5509	One of the greatest threats to international peace in the last decade has come from the activities of anti-American groups and individuals in Russia. I have criticized and strongly resisted anti-American Russian activities. But I have taken action to support efforts to curb these activities when they have harmed America.
5510	Although it is illegal to say that people should turn their spouses in or their family and friends, if they have committed a murder. Because those people are way to close to me and I couldn't picture my life without them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, I think that is wrong especially if you live with the person.
5511	I dont think I could turn someone in or turn their family and friends if they did a murder or rape because those people are way too close to me and I couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, I think that is wrong specially if you live with the person.
5512	I don't think I would turn my spouse or my family or my friends in, or I would send them to jail if they committed a murder. Those people are too close to me and I couldn't imagine my life without them. Why would someone send them away they love, I think it's wrong especially if you live with the person.
5513	Nobody should turn someone they love or someone they really care about if they are suspected of a murder because if those people are very close to you, it would be very stressful and that would make your life very unpleasant without them. Why would you send away someone you love? It seems to be wrong especially if you live with the person.
5514	I dont think I could turn my spouse in or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way too close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love especially if you live with the person.

Other channels like PBS Kids, history channel, and the other channels that help kids and adults get smarter are good too I would say.
5518	To me, books are better than tv because in a book you can use your imagination so the more you read the more your imagination will improve. Also, it helps you to improve your reading, grammar, and it improves your writing skills. I also want to say I hate commercials!!! I hate Sponge Bob!!! I would say PBS Kids, history channel, and the other channels that help kids or adults get smarter I would say are good!
5519	I say books are better than television because books help you to improve reading, grammar, and spelling skills and to think creatively. Also, television is a means of entertainment and so it can become a problem to adults as well as children. The worst thing about television is that you can only watch it once a week!
5520	Books reduce our electricity bills! which is expensive and it is a major part of our economy.
5521	Books really do reduce our electricity bills! books do not use much of our spending money.
5522	Books reduce our electricity bill since they take much of the funds we spend on other things.
5523	Book is always easier and faster than TV. It reduces your electricity bills.
5524	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
5525	Books can make you more intelligent because they can also tell what people are thinking.
5526	books are better than TV. They can say what people are thinking and even show you live news.

5530	Some people can't read is absolutely idiotic to say the people who can't read would always run away from them even then B for books and B for best so books are the best so i can't sleep if i wont read a chapter from any novel everyday but actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in school textbooks and at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv and those 2 news channels so by reading books i can even pass my time and even improve my speaking skills
5531	Some people cannot read is an absolutely idiotic idea to say that the people who cannot read will always run away from them. Also, B for books and B for best means that books are the best. I cannot sleep if I will not read a chapter of any book each day but actually sometimes I feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks and at home novels) so only sometimes I watch TV and that two news channels. Hence by reading books I can even pass my time and even improve my speaking skills.
5532	some people cannot read is absolutely idiotic to say the people who cannot read would always run away from them. Even though, by the book, by the book best so books are the best. I cannot sleep if I won't read a chapter from any novel every day but actually sometimes I feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks and at home novels) so only sometimes I watch TV and those two news channels. Therefore by reading books I can even pass my time and even improve my speaking skills.

5534	Some people cannot read is absolutely idiotic to say the people who cannot read will always run away from them. Besides, even if you don't read books you read, I believe that books are better than TV. I cannot sleep if I cannot read a chapter from any book each day. But actually sometimes I feel reading books all day becomes boring (in school textbooks and at home novels) so only sometimes I watch TV and that two news channels. Thus by reading books I can even pass my time and even improve my speaking skills.
5535	Any of these problems can be rectified in a simple way. If the problems were serious, they wouldn't have just happened in one moment. One such problem that you must say there are several of them that still living people in the same room can see the faces of their dead relatives on the TV. It isn't correct because of all the people who don't have IPTV in their villages we are not sure there are no mirrors in the village so they can see dead relatives on the big screen in the second apartment of the big house and they will think that they are already dead!
5536	There are still other countries which are more progressive, more literated and more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have enough potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that sophisticated with technologies in America. Well, in fact, technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions ever created.
5537	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future India could fail to lead us. There are other countries that are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than this nation, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enough potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
5538	Yes, India is still one of the most development- backward countries in the world. This is because of the weakness of leadership.
5539	All we can say is that this nation is not yet ready yet to lead the whole world. Who knows maybe it will lead the whole world in the future. There are still other countries who are more modern, more advanced, more powerful than India like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation still doesn't have the potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not advanced enough to have the most sophisticated technology like the Americas. Well technology is one of the most sophisticated inventions created in the history.
5540	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. I wouldn't have to say fatherless because I would rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about my life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
5541	For me, having a father without being born to a father is not very good. I prefer not to be fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
5542	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But I would have to say fatherless because I would rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
5543	Well, I have to say I would rather have no man in my life than have a person that isn't concerned about my life at all. To me that is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or more like a role model.
5544	Fatherless isn't an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about my life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
5545	Are you better off with no father because he doesn't care about you? Would you not trust a father that doesn't protect you or care for you? Better off with a lousy father than having someone you can't even trust to protect you. If a father is not around, how can you trust him? It depends upon the parent. I would prefer to have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
5546	Every father is there to protect you. But, if our father is someone that doesn't care about you, and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I can even trust my life with.
5547	My father is someone that I have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I can't even trust my life with.
5548	If our father is someone that doesn't care about us, spends most of his time in his room and doesn't want to participate with us then how can we trust him to protect us? A poor father is someone that is someone we have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father than a father that I cant even trust.
5549	No father is someone is always your for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of your baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.
5550	I think it's better to be a fatherless person than to have a lousy father. I mean I was always taught that a real man should be someone respectable, honest and hard working, if he is not the kind of man I mean there're plenty of good men who can fill these roles but there're also bad men who can fill these roles, so having a lousy father doesn't mean you can not have a good father if you want one
5551	Being fatherless is just fine, especially if it makes you a better person. I mean, i was taught that a real man should be respectable, honest and hard working, if it's not those kind of a man, then he doesn't deserve to be a father at the first place. Besides, just because you don't have a father doesn't mean you can't have a father in you life.
5552	My first argument is that you don't have to be a father if you don't want to be one. Secondly, even if you're a father, it doesn't mean that you'll take care of a child the way a proper father would.
5553	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I mean i was always tought that a true man should be someone respectable, honest and hard working. If he isn't that kind of man then he doesn't deserve to be a father. Besides just because you don't have a father doesn't mean you can't have a good father in your life.
5554	Being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because being fatherless means you can be absolutely free to say what you think instead of being silent about things that you think or shouldn't have to have to think about. If you don't have a father and he didn't take the time to get a father figure in you life then a mother or someone else in your life should because no one truly loves u like your mother.
5555	To have a son is a good thing because it shows that a man's love is real. I don't care what his father did to his mother I have my kid and that's a godly father that I wanted. So if a guy picks a young lady with no idea of what the future holds he will be able to guide her in what is right for her, and not have her scatter because of what his father taught her. Men should only get married, and have a child if they have the will to be a good and godly father, not just because you are young and need a kid to work. Girls should not marry a guy to have a child and then hang him on a cross for his dad because he did something to his mother...but if his dad is a good godly man and he loves her and wants to do right for her, then that's the way he should do it.
5556	I believe both will be bad but I would prefer it if my father was still alive because he could set a good example for me and teach me morals. If my husband was my dad, it would be nice to have someone giving me advice on my life.
5557	It really depends on how good your parent were. I wouldn't say I believe in "here I stand, here I go, I'm no good." If you had a good or decent dad you don't have to be you. A father should set a good example for their children, If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way.
5558	My opinion would be that a child needs a father or a father-like person in their life. If you don't have father or a father like a brother, you would have no direction in your life. Some people might think they can do it on their own, but don't think about it. I do not think about it.
5559	Why would anyone want to be a fatherless child when there are so many opportunities for great futures ahead of a child? A dad should set a good example for their children. If the dad is a lousy father then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.
5560	Dr. Raffles founded Singapore and he was only a subordinate of Dr. Raffles. So it was normal that Dr. Raffles gave the duty of turning Singapore into a successful city to Dr. Raffles and left it to Farquhar to handle.
5561	So it was normal that Raffles gave the duty of turning Singapore into a successful city to Farquhar, leaving Raffles to handle the rest of the country.
5562	Raffles founded Singapore and Farquhar was just a subordinate for Raffles. So it was normal that Raffles left the city to Farquhar to handle.
5563	Singapore was founded by Raffles, and Farquhar was just an assistant for Raffles. So it was normal for Raffles to leave Singapore's development to Farquhar.
5564	Singapore was founded by Raffles and the duties of turning Singapore into a successful city and left the city to Farquhar to handle were just normal.
5565	Well, the people who watch porn, I guess that's okay, it's normal. But the people who are IN the porn, that's not normal. I read it in a abnormal psychology book, which means they have a disorder
5566	I think those who watch porn, well that's okay, it's NORMAL. But those who are IN the porn, that's not normal. I read it in an abnormal psychology book, which means they have a disorder
5567	The people who watch porn, it's okay because it's a normal thing. But the people who are in the porn, this is not normal. I read this in an abnormal psychology book, that means they have a disorder
5568	It's not normal to watch porn. In fact, abnormal psychology books state that sex offenders have a sex addiction.
5569	People who watch porn, i guess that's okay, it's normal. But people who are IN the porn, that is not normal. I read this in a abnormal psychology book, that means they have a disorder
5570	This not only degrades morality, but also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women's empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, rape, and sexual abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.

5572	How about crime rates? Murders, rape, and sexual abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: Pornography. Now, how about movies? Porn star movies, action movies, etc. Yes, I agree that pornography has destroyed society, but if you check all of the major box actors of the past 20 or 30 years, what do you see? You see the majority of them were actresses, now the new generation it seems, they are simply going to be narcissistic, spoiled brat actresses who will be mocked for their looks. Is the internet wrong? Absolutely not. How about the fake women profiles on sites like Tinder? How about sites where you get free samples on how to buy cheap size 16 dresses? How about commercials where there are baby dolls and action figures to display in the video? How about the pitiful looking man props that we use in action movies? What about the obsessive
5573	That is wrong. PORN undermines women’s empowerment, leads to more violence against women, and does not benefit women.
5574	This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. The reality, although unfortunate, is this: females are expected to be in a constant sexual state for their partners. The first step towards getting rid of this sexualization is to stop buying magazines and pornography. Then, by no means encourage your children to be receptive to this.
5575	I do not think it's right, It goes against women rights, and those girls are under aged and abused. It's also really sick in a way, what freak would film people having sex?! I don't get it. I don't see what's so good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
5576	So what's good about it if you want sexual entertainment masturbate! What that flashing tits it's called I don't know why they can wear those clothes too. Of course in erotic movies the girl they keep naked it's hot. Yes it shows she is sexy and it can be pretty hard to explain to a sensitive person... but every woman's body is different. That's why some women wear a panty or even really close fitting clothes. It makes them different from a lady's dress that is loose fitting and show a lot of skin. Anyway, here are some sexy flashes.
5577	I think it's wrong because it goes against women's rights and teenage girls are abused. It's also really sick in a way, what freak would film people having sex? I don't get it. I don't see what's good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
5578	If your life is crappy, sex is probably not a high priority. If you start having sex without love, you run the risk of a dangerous disease or infertility. On the other hand, if you are getting this kind of huge release every time that you have sex, in a way it's cathartic and cleansing and releases all kinds of hormonal and chemical messengers that bring you a feeling of well-being, contentment, and pleasure.
5579	I don't see what's so good about it, if you want sexual entertainment, masturbate or something.
5580	TV is in my opinion the sexiest thing in the world. I think it would be illegal for me to watch people having sex because I'm a passionate feminist but on the other hand I think that boys out here watch porn and do bad things because of it.
5581	Porno is wrong because you would want to watch people have sex. Maybe everyone has different tastes but still if you wanna watch people have sex, get a mirror and have sex and look at yourself, because kids out here are watching it and doing the wrong things!
5582	It's wrong to watch people have sex, especially your child. Maybe everyones feeling is different, but still if you wanna watch people have sex, get a mirror and have sex and look at yourself, because kids out here are watching it and doing the wrong things.
5583	People watch porn because it makes them feel different from others. Maybe everyone feels different, but still if you wanna watch porn, get a mirror and have sex with your own body, cause children are watching it and doing the wrong things.
5584	If you like to watch people having sex... just get a mirror and have sex and look at yourself... because kids out here watch TV and do the wrong things.
5585	Thin content - useless. Content that is still made.No want to know.Power to the people- Enough with marketing appeal. Bombs away!
5586	There's a difference between porn and erotic books. Porn is wrong because it should be in 4-D, with surround sound, and special effects. It would make it much more enjoyable, and it would be more stimulating for young girls, too.
5587	It’s wrong to use porn, because it should be in four dimensions, with surround sound, and special effects. It would make it much more pleasurable, besides, I’m a girl.
5588	Jarman: Porn is wrong because it should be in 4-D with surround sound and special effects. It would make it much more pleasurable. I'm a girl.
5589	Watching pornography is a wrong way to enjoy sexual intercourse. It should be 3D and surround sound with special effects. It would make it much more enjoyable.
5590	According to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived because they were at the edge of their variety.
5591	According to your theory, fruit flies would have adapted and survived because otherwise they would not have been able to conquer the fruit.
5592	In my theory, the fruit flies would have adapted to the presence of ordinary water. As a result, they would be able to survive in the presence of ordinary water.
5593	So according to your theory the fruit flies would have adapted and survived because that isn't the case in nature.
5594	Then according to your theory, the fruit flies would have adapted and survived the radiation.

5600	In other words, it's a common tactic for exposing holes in your opponent's position, and calling names won't win a debate. You just can't answer my questions and I'm sure that is frustrating for you.
5601	Actually, you must not know nothing about debate because what I am doing is called cross examining and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. I will be able to expose your holes with my cross examining.
5602	Actually you must know nothing about debates because what I am doing is called cross examining and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponents position. Also calling names never won a debate and you can't answer my questions and I'm sure that is frustrating for you.
5603	Actually you must know nothing about debate. I've been debating my entire life and I'd say there are only really two true types of debaters...one is good in debating and one is bad in debating. I'd say the bad debater either never really learns the rules, just wants to go out there and insult the person who's debating, wants to blame the debater and thinks they're evil, they didn't even hear their own thoughts. I'm not sure if I can call them good debaters because they never have a chance to be for real. The good debaters can win debates because their intellectual analysis is so
5604	Actually you must know nothing about cross examination because what I am doing is called cross examination and it is a very common tactic for exposing holes in an opponent's position. It is not a popular tactic, because it's not done frequently. Calling names never won a debate, You just can't answer my questions and I'm sure that's frustrating for you
5605	The second point is incorrect because science is not about beliefs and ideas that we believe in. Science is about observations and data that we observe. The second part is incorrect because it is classified under the religion category because that is where religion stands. You are disappointed in others because you think they look like monkeys? Is there really a difference between humans? Are
5606	Creation is not science because it does not adhere to scientific paradigms. It is a religious viewpoint and subject to the interpretation and theological debate in the scientific community.
5607	The idea that creation is a scientific theory and the theory is given or bestowed on humans through the power of reason is a ridiculous one. It should be illegal to classify it under the religion category.
5608	No one can prove Creation or the Bible correct, but that doesn't mean they have to be disillusioned. Look like monkeys? Believe it, I have a white beard, and alligator print feet.
5609	Creation is not Science. This article is divided into 4 different categories.  Why is Creation not Science:  1. Science is the study of Observation and repetition: in the case of Creation, there are too many variables and the studies conducted cannot be repeated. Creation can not be tested by Science. Therefore, creation cannot be judged on the scientific plane
5610	Spreading hatred and causing trouble with viruses should be a thing of the past. One should learn to accept problems with software, viruses and other problems rather than insulting the developer with rude comments that only screw you up.
5611	Microsoft Internet Explorer has the best virus interface in the world. So, why shouldn't you welcome those cute little viruses by sticking with Microsoft Internet Explorer?
5612	IE is a good security, so don't hesitate to use the system. But if you're already using M$ Internet Explorer don't hesitate to switch to M$ Windows XP.
5613	Because IE has the best virus interface in the world and because you would prefer to stick with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
5614	HTML5 is a better way to protect your computer than IE because, not only is it more secure than IE, but it also has the best virus interface in the world. So why shouldn't you try HTML5?
5615	People say FF loads faster than IE. However, 9 times out of 10, someone who has just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading up IE.
5616	FF loads faster than IE, but almost 9 out of 10, someone who just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading up IE.
5617	Those who say Firefox loads faster than Internet Explorer often experience slower program loading times than Internet Explorer loading up themselves.
5618	FF loads faster than IE but 9 times out of 10 someone who had just installed FF will experience slower program load times than loading up IE.
5619	This is true that FF loads faster than IE, but it is also true that 9 times out of 10 people who installed FF experienced slower program load times than IE.
5620	It's an indisputable fact that the average IE user gets laid much more than the average firefox user. Sorry firefox losers, your elated and your time is wasted. GAME STARTED, SET UP THE TERRITORY AND THE CHAMPIONS, ENTER MATCH AND GET READY TO GO FLOOD THE DOM
5621	The IE user gets laid 2500% more than the firefox user. Sorry firefox losers.
5622	Its an indisputable fact that the average Internet Explorer user gets laid 2500% more than the average Firefox user. Sorry Firefox losers! Be careful where you sit there.
5623	It is an indisputable fact that the average Internet Explorer user gets laid 2500% more than the average Mozilla user. Sorry Mozilla losers!
5624	It’s a fact that the average IE user gets a lot more laid than the average Firefox user. Sorry, Firefox users. That’s the game set. Match your bets. Go cry about IE somewhere else. :P
5625	IF physical education isn't there then you would be a couch potato!!! How stupid is this???
5626	If physical education classes are not as important, you would be a couch potato.
5627	If physical education classes aren't too hard, you would be a couch potato. How can you call yourself a couch potato if you can't do anything but sit and watch movies or TV programs?
5628	If physical education isn't required, you would be a couch potato. How are you gonna get your figure to look like that if you don't go out and do exercises?
5629	How can you be physically active and not have any impact on your life? I would say if physical education were not important then you would be a couch potato.
5630	In 1292, there were many pests coming at the people and they were suffering a lot from them. Raffles wasn't around, and William had to think of a solution himself.
5631	There were a lot of pests at that time, and the people were suffering from them. Raffles wasn't around and William had to think of a solution himself.
5632	There were a lot of pests at that time, and the people were suffering from them. Raffles wasn't around, and William had to think of a solution himself.

5634	There were a lot of pests at that time and the people were suffering from them. Raffles wasn't around and William had to think of a solution himself.
5635	William had legalized gambling in Singapore. He did it to make Singapore prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.
5636	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down.
5637	Even though he had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper. But Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.

5640	There was a Man that was trying to start a colony that was outside the jungle in the absence of Malaya and failed at the moment. Firstly, he gave out money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Secondly, Raffles didn't do that.
5641	First of all, Raffles didn't offer money to people. There was the extortion tax that the British colonialists would take from Indians who wanted to stay in Britain. Raffles didn't tolerate this extortion. Secondly, he didn't offer anything to anyone that can be identified as a donation. Thirdly, there is no evidence of his taxing. If you understand these things, then you will know that Raffles didn't contribute to the Indian colony and you would understand why he is a soulless and a cowardly president.
5642	Farquhar contributed significantly to the creation of Singapore, by first offering money as an incentive to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
5643	Quite a number of people helped to establish Singapore out of the jungle - offering money to turn the Land Down Under into a garden. Even Britain wasn't impressed with his 'progressive' approach.
5644	Though he contributed significantly, he didn't offer money as an incentive for people to hunt, but was more concerned with exterminating rats and centipedes. Raffles didn't do that much.
5645	In order to implement actions, you need to have ideas, and Richard Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations whereas Sir James Raffles only came up with ideas, which were or were not feasible. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
5646	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas. When it comes to actions, one requires actions from the other. Farquhar implemented those ideas.
5647	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.

5649	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations. Raffles was the one to come up with the ideas which would or would not work. Actions require actions. Farquhar performed those actions.
5650	William wanted to see the former queen sentenced to hard labour but Raffles executed him in secret. {Despite being assisted by British during his murder, Charles was still executed because he was a traitor.
5651	William was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
5652	William was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though Farquhar had done a lot to help Singapore.
5653	There were many injustice done on Singapore. The Austrians tried to kill all the Muslims by destroying the mosque and were fighting together with Britain. But William had done a lot to help Singapore.
5654	Despite being given a bad reputation by the British, he had done a lot of good to help Singapore.
5655	I don’t think a mother should have the choice to kill her child, but I think she does have the choice whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
5656	My feelings about the issue aren't as black and white as yours. I don't think that a mother should have the choice to kill her child, but I do think that she has the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus that doesn't yet have a nervous system that equal or exceeds that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.
5657	Even if the mind of a fetus can think, it should not be considered to be a human being. A fetus with a less developed nervous system should not have greater rights than a cow.
5658	I think a mother should have the choice whether to kill her child or not. But I think she does not have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.

5660	There are some people who can make the choice to have more children. It is not up to us to decide to add more children to the world.
5661	The government should not try to influence the private decision of how many children a person can have.
5662	People can make the choice for themselves. It is not up to us or the government to decide to add more unwanted children to this world.
5663	What we all have to decide for ourselves is whether or not we want to make an unwanted child and it is not up to us or the government to decide to add more children to this world.
5664	People can make the choice to have a child or not. It is not up to us or the government to decide to add more unwanted children to this world.
5665	And that story is just one of many tragic stories of people that are so poor they can't afford even to eat food and then their lives are lost because they can't get an abortion because they are devout catholics.
5666	There have been three lives lost in the last few years that you would not even know about. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad and got pregnant with twins. She was not allowed to get an abortion because she was a member of a religious family. Her father was incredibly violent to her, and now he is in prison. Their mother was beaten up every day until she had enough and she left to try and find a better life. Her children were taken away from her because of this. This girl probably never knew what life was.
5667	An 11 years old girl from a slums of South America got raped by her step dad and became pregnant. Her family knew she would die in childbirth, but they were not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was and made them experience it.
5668	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. One of those lives actually KNEW what life was.
5669	See? An evil man can still be senseless! A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
5670	Abortion is okay because a fetus is not a human. To be a human, you must have both of these criteria (my own opinion). A fetus cannot be considered human, so abortion is not murder.
5671	 Abortion is ok because a fetus isn’t a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO)  You must be human (homosapien) You must be able to contribute to society.  By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.

5675	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... we grant citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
5676	Here's an interesting thought for those who believe 'life' begins at conception rather than birth… America grants citizenship to people 'born' in the United States, but not to those conceived here.

5678	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... Yes, life can begin at conception. In fact, Americans concede that they will grant citizenship to people born in their country, but not to those conceived here. Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
5679	If you really believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person.
5680	There is actual evidence to support evolution!
5681	There's actual evidence to support evolution.
5682	Evolution is true and there is actual evidence to support it.
5683	There is actual evidence to support evolution.
5684	All I have to say on this issue is that there is actual evidence to support evolution!
5685	Where are we supposed to place the blame? Would it be in God, or Satan for not providing protection? Or the creator that gave it away for us to take? With over 97% of those over 1500 new babies, given that with the fetus before being smuggled in, it would have ended up dead? What a hypocritical system. But yet, still, to have great pride in something is a low mental state. Why? Well, it has a very low resilience. For more information see my book - The Resilience of a Cooperative Universe (After Judgment) where i focus more on the difference between a socialist and a capitalist way of living. Note that the Socialists are like Che Guevara, except they kill more people than Che.
5686	Yes, that all makes sense. A good use of Gods time.
5687	Jesus was a single-celled organism that God created billions of years ago. God created the universe (including the Earth and the giant fireball called a sun and the galactic system around the sun), and God created humans first, and then God created Jesus. So, God didn't tweak the scientific concept of evolution in any way and Jesus didn't get any fairy godmother powers from any godmother.
5688	What is God doing in the year 2000 to judge us and what makes sense about it? What purpose can his coming serve? He is all-powerful and he created the big bang billions of years ago. So why wouldn't he use his all-power to change something. Making humans evolve is good idea as is being one of the biggies. Having to address all those issues would be tiring. Besides, he can still come and judge us in 2000 even though he's not here now.
5689	If you're not comfortable with anything God does, I hope you're fine about whether it's something God is doing or something God has done. Because I think that everything God does is too good to be true. So if you're not comfortable with something God does, like creation, etc. I don't think you're really comfortable with God.
5690	Why don’t we evolve? How are you so sure we are not evolving? Could you please show some evidence that we are not? And don't say, because we would notice if we were. Solid evidence if your key to proving your point.
5691	How come humans aren't still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are NOT evolving? And dont say, because we would notice if we were. Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.
5692	How come people aren't still evolving? How are you so sure we are not? Could you please show some evidence that we are not evolving? And don't say, because we would notice if we were. Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.
5693	How come people aren't still evolving? How do you know we are not? Could you please provide solid evidence that we are not evolving? And don't say that because we would notice if we were. Solid, measurable evidence to prove your point.

5695	For my wife and I, watching porn is an exciting and passionate love life because we can use it to spike our sex lives. We set the room on fire using it. I like to use it in the bedroom with my wife and we enjoy it. So long as it's legal and everyone is of age then there shouldn't be any problem.
5696	that's why as long as it is legal and everyone is of age there should be no problem.

5700	You think community service is important because it teaches you to be a better person by helping others. When other people help you out, you learn to be a better person. It also lets you find a better path to help others in the future. Therefore, you should not let others take the learning and advancement to the next level. But then again, you should not let others take advantage of you. So it is important that you find a balance.
5701	Common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out it's more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.

You get to be a role model by helping some one that is in need of your help. Yes personal pursuits are important, when you are thinking of going to college. But then you have to think of leaving a legacy behind by teaching what you know. So, the learning process can advance. Therefore, you let other take it further to the next level.
5705	When helping others, it not only benefits that person or people, but it makes you feel good as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
5706	In my opinion, I think that advancing the common good is better than individual concerns. When helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
5707	In my opinion, helping others is better than spending time on yourself. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
5708	I think that advance the common good is better because it makes you feel better than just spending time on yourself. It doesn't mean I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
5709	As an art, helping others can be a good art. However, if it's necessary to spend more time on yourself, than it's better if you will do so.
5710	This is planet earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, everyone alive should take it, choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There is no other way around it. I don't want to hear it's human nature to be selfish or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.
5711	This is the Earth's, not just yours. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it, choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish.

5713	Whether you're selfish or not, you should be willing to give up some things so that everyone can live a better life.

5715	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then the results of it will be visible to them. But, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
5716	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then no person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.

5720	You are the only one who knows what you feel, think and believe. If you want change, you would do it to yourself.
5721	It's okay for you to help yourself. If everyone would take care of themselves and try to be better people, there would be no need for common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe. If you want change, you would do the same to yourself.
5722	You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
5723	You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want to change you would change yourself.
5724	Helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves, tried to make themselves better people, and didn't rely on someone else for help then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change, then you would do change to yourself.
5725	Talking bad about other people can not bring back the death of an innocent child. The best thing to do is to focus on how you can help the innocent child and not make the child think about the bad things they say to you. Talking about others is easy, but focusing on how to help them and making them smile is so much more important.
5726	Advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame, or just karma.
5727	As long as you improve yourself or better your life for the sake of others the philosophy of advancing the common good will come back to you in some way no matter how big or small it is. Whether it is money, fame or karma.

5730	Separating students from other people for a while is a good idea because it can increase the number of garment jobs. Why do soldiers wear uniform? for the purpose of separate from civil. Why do terrorists wear uniform? for the purpose of harmonious with civil and easy to attack the enemy.
5731	Good idea for separate students from other people because only the students who live in separate places can improve and better garment jobs. Why we use soldier uniform? It is used for separate students from other people and for reducing terrorists. Why terrorist cannot use soldier uniform? It is used for the terrorists and civil are equally important.
5732	Separating students from other people is a good idea. Why we use soldiers uniform? It's for the army, so soldiers are separated from civilians. Why terrorists do not use soldiers uniform? They are interested in harmonious with civilians, and not easy to attack enemies.
5733	Separating students from other people can increase business in garment industry. Why we use soldier uniforms? To separate civilians from soldiers. Why terrorist don't use uniforms? To blend in and easily attack the enemy.
5734	The use of soldier uniform is appropriate for civil and most easily differentiated from the civilian. Also, it can easily be attacked by terrorists and may cause casualties to civilians.
5735	Studying with school uniform makes the child feel obliged to do it. He can express himself in the dress. Remember the interview too.
5736	You shouldn't wear school uniforms because they don't fit very well, they get dirty, it really sucks and they don't express your individuality. Let's be honest, school uniforms look really out of place.
5737	school uniform is a good idea, but that doesn't hurt students life emotions. Imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wouldn't he look good. Remember, dressing sense is also a part of interveiw.
5738	Some people are wearing clothdress and shoes neatly. Others can't. And it doesn't matter what they put on their heads. Someone else wears flip-flops. And even if he is wearing pants, it doesn't matter if he has to change them after a dance. Remember, it's the interviewee, not the interviewer, that comes off badly.
5739	School uniform doesn't harm students life because the physical part of students interveiw (shirt,pant,tie and shoes) goes for them so is none of it of concern to a big degree. At the same time, a bully is an option, that can't be relived nor appealed to. So dressing sense comes into play. Imagine a bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes, would he look good. Remember dressing sense is also a part of your interveiw
5740	If your father is a lousy person, then you would have no reason to be concerned about him. Just because he is not a good father does not mean you should not have someone there. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
5741	There are better reasons to question why a father is so lousy: maybe he's not your father. You don't really know if that's the case, though. Maybe you were adopted and your real father was killed in a war. Perhaps you were raped and you never knew the father. It doesn't matter how you came to be without a father. I don't know how many girls are there who are really so bad that they deserved to be turned into a blouse by their stepfather. But I am sure that you do not deserve to be turned into a blouse by your father. Go out and fight him! Fight him with whatever you have! With scissors if you don't have anything else. Take on the life that he gave you. Be strong and brave. Or, begging is a good enough reason for you to stop seeing him
5742	Don't have a father because you have nothing to keep in mind. All your life that father is not gonna do anything for you because he never knew you. Even if he did, he'd be a lousy father who is never going to love you or take good care of you. It's no way for me to be in a situation like that. The person who will take care of you is your mother. The fact that you don't have any father in your life only proves that I'm right about this. I can't see the reason for having a lousy father for your life.
5743	No one would argue that father is the most important thing in a child's life. The important thing is the fact that the child has a father at all. Whether it is lousy or not. It does not matter if your father spanks you or not. It does not matter if you know him or not. You would have had a father anyway.
5744	Even if you had a lousy father, you still have a chance to work on your father's character and bring that into yourself. What if he had a different kind of father? What if you never got to meet him? It is better to have a lousy father because you can change him into a better one.
5745	It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A father who is always working and not having time for you, is not a reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
5746	If someone you don't know is asking your name and you're in a hurry and can't say it, don't say the name. If the guy is not your boyfriend but a random person from your social circle, it doesn't mean that you have to say his name because it's awkward.
5747	It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
5748	Having a bad father is not that bad if he works hard and gives you everything you need but it's important to have a model that you want to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
5749	Having a father is important because it is a person who can educate you and show you what is right and what is wrong. This is why even though I don't have any father, I can still learn from this brother. As long as he is around, I will be able to learn from him. It helps me a lot, it may be my brother that helps me become a better person, he certainly helps me see the world through a better perspective.
5750	At the same time, I think that it is very unfair to blame everything you have done so far on your father. The father is not the reason you mess up when he has no problem with you not having a good job or failing exams. Maybe he would go to the grave angry but you have to assume that he's just mad because that's the nature of a poor man.
5751	It's better to have a father that can only blame you for some of your mistakes. Like my father. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy. He's got to try to care what you want to do, but he doesn't really do. I think it's an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy. He's got to try to care what you want to do, but he doesn't really do.
5752	It's better to have a lousy father because, he won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it. He wouldn't care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall and put a hole in it, because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.
5753	If a father is mad at you for getting into trouble then I think it's up to him. He can tell you how he feels, but not why. he can yell at you, he can tell you to go get rid of the bag, but he can't tell you why he hates you.
5754	Having a lousy father for practical reasons is not true because he can still search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think he needs it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed at you and throw your backpack with your computer in it at a wall, which would put a hole in it. That kind of father isn't lousy, I think it's true because he will tell you that he hates you and he ruined your life.
5755	This is worse than I ever dreamed I could be worse than a loving father I’m more than a dream who isnt gonna come true  Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare If it falls apart I would surely wake it Bright lights turn me clean this is more wrong than i can say
5756	I never wanna be here and punch in a dream breathing life into my nightmare if it falls apart I would surely wake it. Bright lights turn me clean this is worse than it seems
5757	I don't ever want to be here or like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare. If it falls apart I will surely wake it. Bright lights turn me clean. This is worse than it seems.
5758	It was an interesting story but I don't wanna be here. Like punching in a dream, I breathe life into my nightmare. If it falls apart, I would surely wake it and that's what I do to wake myself up. Bright lights turn me clean. This is worse than it seems.
5759	Why? Even though I know there are amazing things going on out there I refuse to believe them and ignore my need to be aware. As a person who mostly avoids contact with people there are nights I question my sanity and self-preservation because of the terrifying and violent things that I hear and read. I am obviously an unsupervised child of my time who has grown up in an environment that is free of
5760	TV is better if you are watching an informational channel because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects when you are done learning and ready to relax.
5761	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
5762	TV is better because it covers topics that book cannot and TV allows you to select from a variety of channels, unlike a book.
5763	I think it is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.
5764	TV is better than books if you are watching informational channels. It's better than books because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects. And when you are ready to relax you can switch to a funny channel or whatever you want to watch.
5765	TV comes in all different languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
5766	If you can't speak the same language as the people around you then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
5767	Mostly if you can only understand or speak a specific language but you move to a different country then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
5768	Language books may not be available in another language. but on TV the language can be heard in a different language.

5770	Same-sex marriage can cause a lot of controversial discussions. It can put people's lives at risk in extreme cases. Gay marriage has caused so much trouble. People have resulted in murder and suicide
5771	Same sex marriage causes a lot of controversy, it puts people's lives at risk in extrem cases gay marriage has caused so much trouble, people have resulted in murder and suicide.
5772	Being gay or having a same sex relationship can cause a lot of conflict, it puts people's lives at risk in extreme cases same-sex marriage has caused so much trouble people have resulted in murder and suicide
5773	When same-sex marriage was legalized, people started to take risks on their lives and make wrong decisions. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be banned.
5774	Same sex marriage can bring a lot of controversy, it puts peoples lives at risk, especially extreme cases where gay marriage has caused so much trouble. People have resulted in murder and suicide.
5775	India was a country by whose fear Alexander's army was afraid. After just six years of independence, India has become the sixth member of the Security Council of the United Nations. Also, India is the country with a high economic development rate. And I know that none of us are ignorant to the great contribution of India in the discovery of God particle. Then why doesn't India have a potential to become a superpower?
5776	During Alexander's invasion India was his greatest fear. After sixty years of independence India is known for its economic development rate and great contributions to scientific discovery. Therefore, India should be given the 5th spot of the UN Security Council. I also know that none of us are unaware of the great contribution of India to the discovery of partical matter. There is no reason why India is not granted the sixth seat of the Security Council.
5777	In my opinion, it is a great contribution from India as a rising country to the discovery of God Partical. We should be proud of India.
5778	India is not a country that's afraid of France. After all, their nation was born over a thousand years ago. In fact, they can be looked at as France's closest ally. Like other European states, India is the sixth member of the U.N. Security Council. However, India is also one of the world's fastest-growing countries and it has a great economic development rate. Also, it has contributed to the discovery of God Particle since the time it was founded. Why then are some foolish people pointing out that India has only the potential that others have?
5779	And when I looked back, I remember that India was the only country whose fear Alexandre's army was afraid of. After just sixty years of independence, India is looked as the country to become the sixth member of the Security Council of the United Nations. And it is also the country with a great development rate and I know that none of us are unknown to the great contribution of India in the discovery of the glue. Then from where does the matter come that India is not having the potential
5780	Don't you think it is obvious, that India has the POTENTIAL to lead the world, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower, and the resources to lead the world.
5781	India has the potential to lead the world, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower and the resources to lead the world.
5782	At this time, India has the potential to lead the world but I don't see that happen going to happen anytime soon. They have the knowledge, manpower, and the resources to lead the world
5783	Of course India has the potential to lead the world, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. They have the knowledge, the manpower, and the resources to lead the world.
5784	India is capable of leading the world but it won't happen anytime soon because they have the knowledge, manpower, and resources needed for it.
5785	The evidence we have indicates that the flood of Noah could not have happened. THINK about this : If the flood of Noah happened, we should expect to find the remains of long dead animals and people all over the world, but we don't find this at all. Dinosaurs bones are found in several different layers of rock strata, at different depths. If the flood had happened, we should expect to find dinosaurs and all other remains in the same layer of rock but we don't.
5786	Scientific evidence proves that the flood of Noah could not have happened. THINK OF THIS: IF THE FLOOD OF NOAH HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND THE REMAINS OF LONG-DESERTED ANIMALS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WE DO NOT FIND THIS AT ALL. Dinosaurs bones are found in several different layers of rock strata, at different depths. If the flood had happened, we should expect to find dinosaurs and all other remains in the same layer of rock but we don't.
5787	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. THINK ABOUT THIS : IF THE FLOOD OF NOAH HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND REMAINS OF LIVE ANIMALS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WE DONT FIND THIS AT ALL. DINOSAUR BONES ARE FOUND IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LAYERS OF ROCK STRATA, AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS. IF THE FLOOD HAD HAPPENED, WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND DINOSAURS AND ALL REMAINS IN THE SAME LAYER OF ROCK BUT WE DONT.
5788	We have scientific evidence that the flood of Noah could not have happened. Think about this: If the flood of Noah happened, we should expect to find the remains of long dead animals and people all over the world. But we don't find this at all. Dinosaurs bones are found in many different layers of rock strata, at different depths. If the flood of Noah happened, we should expect to find dinosaurs and all other remains in the same layer of rock.
5789	Reason: In the Bible, Genesis, Chapter 9, verses 26-27, it says: {About these three days Noah did not close the door of the Ark, nor did he yet eat anything, nor did he drink any of the water of the flood. But Noah had charge of the Ark, and It was moved about on the waters, as he directed it.
5790	If spanking doesn't work, try a different option. That can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed.
5791	It's better to try a different way besides spanking that can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed.
5792	Spanking, along with discipline and love, is more effective at changing a child's behavior than any other approach.
5793	I don't think it would be better to try a different option like spanking that can have a negative effect on the child's way of thinking and may cause them to be depressed
5794	With proper education, the child's behaviour is not dependent on spanking alone.
5795	Although I do not agree with spanking I do believe that it is an option for parents to discipline their children. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
5796	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted as a discipline because there are many options that parents can take in order to discipline a child. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
5797	There is no argument in this because if there's a healthy parent-child relationship that the child doesn't need to be spanked or even punished by it to learn right from wrong because there is a communication from the parent to the child.
5798	I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.
5799	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted as a form of discipline and that a parent should have multiple solutions to address the behavior of a child. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong. In this case, it's my opinion that a parent should have multiple solutions.
5800	Some parents use spanking to teach their children. It's not right because they will always be scared of them.
5801	There are some parents that beat their children for every little thing. And that is wrong. They won't be afraid of them.
5802	There are some parents that spank their children. and that is not right. Children who were hit by their parents in the first years of their lives will always be scared.
5803	Parents spank their kids for everything, and that is not right, children are scared of parents and it will be a problem for them in the future
5804	There are some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that's not right. They will always be scared of them.
5805	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. However, sometimes it may be necessary to spank your children, but in my opinion, it should always be the last resort.
5806	Parents should never rely on spanking their children. It should always be the last resort.
5807	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, spanking your children may sometimes seem necessary, I disagree with using it as a last resort.
5808	Parents should not rely on spanking their children. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion, it should always be the last resort.
5809	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
5810	Yes, I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marry somebody that would murder anyone. But that's beside the point.
5811	Yes, it is. Everyone should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marry someone who would murder anyone. But that's beside the point.
5812	Well I'm a little picky about people when it comes to marriage. I find it's impossible for me to take a man's word to be his g/f, and I find, morally, women are always in the victim position. However, someone with similar moral standards to mine should be able to marry without it being a
5813	Yes, I would marry someone that would murder someone. But that's not the point.
5814	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marry somebody that would murder anybody. But that's beside the point.
5815	But if my wife committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I couldn't live with the thought of her murdering someone, the relationship wouldn't be the same. Now I would see the person as something else and I would be out of touch with her... and even more so would I not allow her to visit my parents any more, and I would have to tell everyone I already didn't want to be there.
5816	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.
5817	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered somebody. The relationship would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.
5818	If your spouse commits murder you wouldn't have to turn them in because you don't think you could go on with life knowing they have murdered somebody. The relationship wouldn't be the same and it wouldn't be viewed as you spouse any more. You see them as a bad person and they can be crazy enough to do something to you.
5819	If your spouse committed murder, I think that you would have to turn him/her in because you don't think that you would go on with your life knowing that they have murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.
5820	My husband will be turning himself in, because is a crime and for every act, I have learned that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
5821	I would turn him in for a crime like murder, because it is a crime and for every act, I have learned that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
5822	If your husband kills someone you will turn him in, because it is a crime. And for every act that you have done, you have learned that there is a consequence for everything that you do. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
5823	My husband, if he commits murder, I will turn him in because it is a crime and for every act, I have learned that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
5824	If my husband has murder anyone I will turn him in, because he has committed a crime and there are consequences for everything. And he'll have to pay for the consequences of his crime.
5825	You would definitely turn her in. No matter what it is murder. No one should commit murder, and as soon as she might be crazy and kill me or kill another person. I would live scared in my own house, because someone might find out about it and maybe I would be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your wife, and you love her so I rather prefer her never telling anyone that makes my life easier.
5826	No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. Because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.
5827	If you can prove that she is crazy, she would be arrested. But if she is crazy and kills you, she would also go to jail. So, it would not make life easier for her to not tell her the truth.
5828	Whatever you think your spouse is doing to you, you should not run away. She should be reported immediately to the police.
5829	If she would commit murder, I would certainly turn her in. No matter what, it's murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy, and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her murder. Because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad, because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I prefer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.
5830	Don't kid yourself. The vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
5831	Don't kid yourself that the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill anyone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
5832	Don't kid yourself. The vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
5833	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience and not for preventing the mother's or the child's death. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
5834	Don't believe that the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
5835	Could be spelled Edution, which means to teach things. Edution should be done in schools since it's the only place they attend.
5836	OK no, yes, and no, I think PE should be education, which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style, not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise CAN BE FUN, not having an obese child being bullied because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real education. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups.
5837	OK No and yes I think PE should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track. Showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bullied because they can't run as fast as someone else. That's what physical education could be real education. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push-ups.
5838	OK, no and yes I think PE should be education, which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle, not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can be fun not having an obese child being bullied because they can't run as fast as someone else. That's what physical education could be. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups.
5839	OK No, PE should not be teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy lifestyle. It should be teaching them how to eat right and live a healthy life style. However, as a physical education teacher it is obvious that choosing certain physical activities like getting down on one knee during matcha hours is not so much about physical education but a political statement. It is now highly politicized and I don't know what any future politicians and our current politicians hope to accomplish by giving students a taste of this subject. There are many things we do in PE and with no political ideology to stand behind...I think we as a subject are forgotten. The minute you bring politics into the picture, the subject and the activity are taken away from physical education and are part of an politically driven book, DVD, internet education for some reason. That is my opinion as a physical education teacher.
5840	But if you like marriage how about you let everyone marry whoever they choose and simply allow them to adopt a child just as married couples do. Honestly, what would be the major difference between a married couple or a gay couple wanting to adopt a child? It would just be a civil matter. But without recognizing gay marriage people in another state will not accept your child. It would be ridiculous. Honestly, people are doing it wrong and it's only being exploited by people who might not like it or don't understand. Who wants kids for the rest of their lives? If they liked what they do they would stop and you would stop asking them to do it...it's a crappy term and messing with people feelings by treating them as criminals and then forcing laws against them...it's a hypocritical and ridiculous way of going about it.
5841	The Supreme Court cannot pass an amendment stating what marriage is. So why on earth would they allow it to be banned?
5842	In my opinion, whatever one calls it, gays should be allowed to have the same rights that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, The coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it - gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the Constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they are leaving it up to the states. However, Bush wanted to make a amendment that stated what marriage is to any gay couple.
5843	I don't care if calling it "married couple" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, but Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...
5844	It is unfortunate that the supreme court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is. A true romantic could probably see the obvious- something like "four people who desire to be together in life and what they wanna do together." Yet for some reason, a single unified line between this statement and marriage doesn't make sense.
5845	According to me, homosexuals should be allowed to marry, as long as they are in a civil relationship.
5846	There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like!!
5847	There is an argument of people saying gay marriage is acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it's wrong however I think anyone should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because why can I get married to the other side, but a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman can't express his feelings as gay sexuality. I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like.
5848	 People should be allowed to express their sexuality to whomever they like. No one should be forcing anyone into a lifestyoe that they don't like.
5849	Well there is an argument of whether it's acceptable or unacceptable to openly express gay feelings to the one they love. I would say most of the British population would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express their feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. How come we can get married to the other sexuality but a man can't express gay feelings to a man or a woman or a woman as gay? I think all gais should be allowed to do what they like when they want!!!
5850	Regarding the fundamental right of equality, gays have it. The government has a better image if we allowed the third gender to have the equal right of marriage. racism, sexism and hate are not non-existent, they are actively reported about.
5851	First of all, gays have the fundamental right of equal happiness. Second of all, they are still part of society. Third of all, the government would have a better image if we allowed the third gender to have equal rights of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.
5852	There are three fundamental rights of equal happiness: First, the basic equality of rights and basic human respect. Second, equality in political access, of equal opportunity. Third, there is equal rights for the third gender. In this case, they would have the equal right of marriage, since we are in a democratic republic.
5853	First of all, gays have the fundamental right of equal happiness, second of all, they are still part of society, and third of all, the government would have a better image if we allowed the third gender to have the equal right of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.
5854	First of all, gay rights are valid human rights, the second of all they are still part of society. Third of all, the government would be a better image if we allow gay rights for third gender of people. Also, proving that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.
5855	Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions and cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.
5856	My religion doesn't forbid gay marriage. They don't have to. And I don't think that religions should be extended to other religions. Gay people marrying is no threat to my marriage to the opposite gender either. They simply get married and get on with it just like everyone else.

5860	It's better to be happy with yourself, enjoy helping others and satisfy yourself with your own success if you succeed in life. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already successful and has money, he decides to help others.
5861	I think personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. I also think if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already successful and with money he decides to help others.
5862	Self-pursuit is better than helping others because you have to help yoursel first before you can help others. Also, if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world and satisfy yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life through hardwork and by following his goals. Once he is successful, and has money, he decides to help other people.
5863	To help others, you must first help yourself. When you feel happy with yourself and are enjoying life, you have the confidence and the strength to help others while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and his goal is achieved, when he is already successful, and with money, he decides to help others.
5864	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yourself first.

For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already successful he decides to help others.
5865	Personal pursuit is better for me because I am more of a selfish person. I prefer to do something that is going to make my life better but occasionally I do have my giving moments. So I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
5866	I will be more of a selfish person and do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I will have my giving moments. Right now, I am going for the personal pursuit.
5867	My personal pursuit is better because I'm a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments. Right now I'm going for the personal pursuit.

5870	It's clearly stated that it is possible that he killed his exwife and her friend but this book, which is in extremely poor taste, is his pitiful attempt to convince an overhelming majority that he is innocent. So maybe he has lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book and other gain ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
5871	Although he killed his ex-wife and her friend, his book is a pitiful attempt to convince an overwhelming majority that he is innocent. I don't think he has lost his mind, and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
5872	The man (an old man) might have killed his ex-wife and her friend, but his (the writer's) book (which is in extremely poor taste, damn offensive) was his pitiful attempt to convince an overwhelming majority that he is innocent.  I don't think he has lost his mind since he lost his civil court case, but rather he has lost himself and any monetary gains from his book and other ventures should be garnished to pay the restitution he owes.
5873	I don't think that he killed his ex-wife and her friend. But I think that he lost his mind and since he lost his civil court case, the revenue from his book should be garnished to pay the restitution that he owes.
5874	He (the old man) didn't kill his ex-wife and her friend. This book (which is in extremely poor taste, damn offensive) is his pitiful attempt to convince an overhelming majority that he is innocent.

5875	To desecrate the American flag, you have to violate the first amendment. However, recently in 2005, the House passed a law making in illegal to desecrate the American flag. This is still waiting for final approval through the legal system.
5876	First Amendment doesn't specifically protect the flag but specifically protects certain claims of peaceable assembly and petition.  Therefore this particular part of the constitution should be mentioned in the text. Also, it is not legal to desecrate the American flag, as it is currently worded. We could talk about what the law states, but since it's not illegal, there is no point.
5877	It is protected by the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
5878	Privacy and law enforcement differ. In some countries it is illegal, or even moral offense to publish certain details, while in other countries it is legal and they could even be filed under national security.  Throughout the world different kinds of law exist for different kinds of issues.
5879	The U.S. Flag is protected by the first amendment of the bill of rights. Desecration is legal. Recently the House passed a law making desecration of the American Flag illegal.  It is still awaiting further approval through our legal system.
5880	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. With all the news you can hear about on TV, you can forget about some of the other stuff. It also distracts people. As far as phones go, they can distract people too. Although they don't, many people still have them. The only time I wouldn't mind it is when my friends call me when I'm on a task at hand.
5881	No you are not better off "always" to wear one. On the radio today it was saying on average in the US, 30,000 people die each year for not wearing their seat belt. Thereabout 10,000 die each year because they had it on. It is in my opinion a harm of my rights, but I can't afford the fine either, and they are getting tough on the fines lately.
5882	@ 30,000 people die each year for not wearing their seat belt. Additionally, approximately 10,000 people die each year from wearing a seatbelt.
5883	Not wearing seat belts is a harm of my rights but I can't afford the fine and they are getting tough on the fines lately.
5884	It is in my opinion a harm of my rights, but I can't afford the fine either, and they are getting tough on the fines lately
5885	There are Scientology schools, where most kids who were born into it go, but I have never heard of it being taught in public school.  You wouldn't attend these schools unless you were a Scientologist.  Scientology has kind of seeped into many aspects of society by way of a number of front groups that do various things for the community, like Narconon and the like.  These groups do not advertise that they are really Scientologists, so it is very possible that if you heard that Scientology was being taught in the ____ school, it's definitely run by Scientologists.

5890	Yes, I have worked with a few different local police departments and I trust them. As for the city I live in, I do, very much. There are some great officers there and they are respectful and caring. They try and do the best they can for the community. The chief is awesome and backs his officers.

5900	Sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and put them in the general population with a tee shirt that reads "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." I believe that it would still deter people to a certain extent. Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. Might not deter people to a certain extent, but what will?
5901	Still, we should sentence terrorist convicts to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison and keep them in the general population with a t-shirt that reads, &quot;I'm a terrorist and I kill innocent women and children.&quot; Surely the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terroist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. Might not deter anyone, but what will?
5902	Sentence them to life in prison and put them in our worst supermax prison. They should stay in the general population with a tee shirt that says "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." Certainly the guards will turn a blind eye to whatever unfortunate things happen to a convicted terrorist. I think we would find that there is still honor among thieves. Might not deter people, but what will?
5903	Sentence them to life imprisonment and put them in a supermax prison that is the worst prison in the general population. Keep them in the general population with a T-shirt that reads: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children." As long as the guards don't find it offensive, surely they will overlook the horrible murder of innocents. I think we would find that the murder of innocent people have a bad effect on the honor of criminals.
5904	Using a conviction by a guilty verdict would shame him in our society. We should sentence him to life in prison and put him in a supermax prison with a shirt that says: "I'm a terrorist and kill innocent women and children."  It might not deter people, but what will.
5905	Occupying another peoples land is always a crime and it is a crime no matter where it is occuring. Same goes for at the same time the current US occupation of Iraq and Syria.
5906	In conclusion, the world isn't fair, and not because some people have guns and "protection" such as states have BIG GUNS and "protection", the law is lenient with them. They are protected!
5907	It happens all over the world, even countries that are ruled by bad regimes can't be held accountable.  Such as Israel in its occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967. Israel was caught breaking the law (occupying another people's land) because it was protected by the US (through Veto Power) and it wasn't militarily kicked out like any other normal country would have been. (eg. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.)  So in conclusion, the proper answer to your good question would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have "big guns" and "protection", the law is lenient with them.  Luv ya! :)  Bye Bye
5908	It happens all over the world, even bad countries aren't held accountable. One example of this is Israel for its occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967.

(Eg. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.). So in conclusion, the proper answer to your good question would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have GUNS and "protection", (like some states have BIG GUNS and "protection"), the law is lenient with them. Love you! Bye
5909	In point of view, since 1967, Israel has been occupying Palestinian lands. Why was it not the like any other normal country that faced same problem? Why was Israel protected by the USA by the use of veto power, and not military kicked out like any other normal country would have been?  It happened all over the world, even in bad countries there are some people who have GUNS and protection (like some states have BIG GUNS and protection). Those who get the law leniently are the same who get protection from the law, yet those who get protection from the law should be punished like any other normal country, they shouldn't have any special treatment. So, as for your question, the proper answer would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have GUNS and protection (like some states have BIG GUNS and protection), the law is lenient with them.
5910	You are right. He would be off the street for good, and because he went to jail, the gun would never come home.
5911	Those in my family who were killed or injured, I would want them to pay for their actions. If it were to go to the gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. It may not bring back the love ones that were lost, but it would have the satisfaction of knowing it could never be done to anyone else, and he would be off the streets for good.
5912	If someone in your family has been killed, you want the person responsible to pay, and if it meets going to the gas chamber or lethal injection then so be it. It may not bring that loved one back, but you would have the satisfaction of knowing it could never go and do it to anyone else, he would be off the streets for good. Thank you for your two points.
5913	If it met going to the gas chamber or lethal injection, then so be it. I believe that it can only bring that love one back, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing it could never go and do it to anyone else, he would be off the streets for good. Thank you for the two points!
5914	If your family had been injured or killed, and the person that did it was a member of your family, I would want them to be held accountable. This can happen, and it does, even if the person is apprehended and placed in jail and then tried in a death penalty court. However, I would not want the person to be punished if the person in question commits suicide, or if they are malingering the injury. There is no need to put a human being through such a horrific experience, only to make them feel like they have no hope. If they were to kill themselves or doctor their own wounds in order to get into a firing squad, then yes, they could be put to death, but I would not want it done to anyone else, or anyone who is

5920	As far as property is concerned, it's in your home, so nobody can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging that it was stolen. Since it's unlikely that the doctor will fabricate a police report, I wouldn't worry too much about property. In general, there is no law against subverting a police report. The police do not have the right to enter your home without a warrant in the majority of cases, exceptions for responding to calls from home and domestic violence. As far as the child is concerned, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet. Good luck and hang in there.

5925	abortion isn't really great for a woman's health either ya know? There are the few that get raped and whatever the other excuses are but there is adoption for that and as for health...my child has a right to live more than I do. I think it's better to be a father instead of just giving birth and allowing her to die. {Miranda:So do you think it's ethical for some people to participate in child trafficking and have multiple children if that is what they are going through emotionally? What say you about babies being swapped at adoption? It's called the gray market now. But the mentality of a lot of men is that it's a one shot deal and they're not going to take responsibility for the life they give birth to...ya know??? And then you can't make them get a job and when they want a break they get into drugs or alcohol or whatever...
5926	No, we wouldn't have to factor in the unwanted people if legs would be kept closed and there plenty of people who want but can't have.

5929	By keeping legs closed and wanting to be raped they are self controlled people so there would be no issue but now, if there self control was practiced, there would be no problems with birth control and not as much unwanted people.
5930	If the minor is under 12 yrs old I'd say "NO" I think the age of criminal responsibility needs to be lowered. But at 12 I think your pretty aware of the things you are doing and the effects of them. And there have been a couple of murders in the US that were very thought out, planned, and commited by teenagers. They should not only be tried as an adult but punished as an adult.

5935	liberal democrates have made it okay to do all these things. If, in some maraculus way, drugs or alcohol became band, they would immediately demand that the law be "unconstitutional". I've heard that they took out the picture of George Washington praying out of a school because they said that it was "unconstitutional". He's our founding father. And they just took his picture out because they thought it was suggesting the christian values in the school. But they teach the kids about hinduism and judisum, but when it comes to christianity, it's illegal to teach the kids about that. And instead of trying to keep kids out of sex, they're handing out condoms, and trying to encourage the next generation to use them. I agree, it's twisted.
5936	The liberals have made it ok to do all these things. If, in some maraculus way, drugs or alcohol became legal, they would IMMIDIATELY demand that the law is "unconstitutional".

And they just took his picture out because they thought it was suggeting the christian values in the school.

And, In stead of trying to keep kids out of sex, THEY ARE HANDING OUT CONDOMS, and trying to "encourge" the kids to be safe. I agree, it's twisted.

5940	First, my expertise. I worked for a firm that has fought drunk driver lawsuits and drunk driving cases. You don't have to wait to use carnal knowledge to commit a crime.  You're able to use it immediately to commit it.  To be entrapment, the minor decoy needs to be motivated by going through extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him. The test is the same as in the liquor store: was the clerk predisposed to sell alcohol to minors? If the decoy just says "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to sell alcohol to minors and it's not entrapment.
5941	First, my expertise as a lawyer and my other work in-house for a legal contracting company show that child trafficking is the most lucrative enterprise that criminals can engage in. It's the handsomest and riskiest and best business criminals can run. Crime syndicates, gangs, cartels, and the mafia all make money selling children.
5942	First, my expertise. I was a lawyer and I worked for a law firm that litigated liquor licensing cases. It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol. The test is whether the clerk predisposed the crime of selling alcohol to a minor. If the decoy just says "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.
5943	First, it takes immense expertise to create unnecessarily detailed entrapment theories. Second, to entrap someone you must make it appear they will do something and take them to a place where they are going to do something. You can't use minor decoys to convince a clerk to sell alcohol to you. This isn't entrapment because clerks are predisposed to commit crimes.
5944	First, my expertise. I'm a lawyer and I used to work for a firm that does liquor license litigation. It would only be entrapment for law enforcement to send decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk would sell them alcohol. It would only be entrapment if the decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him. The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.  If the decoy just says to the clerk, "Oh, come on!" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment.
5945	No. There is a reason that you have to be an adult to serve on a jury. Teens, in general, don't possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case. More life experience and maturity is required when making decisions that will affect someones entire life.
5946	No, teens in general don't possess the rational and mature thought necessary to make objective decisions based on the evidence, and tend to go more with what their emotions are telling them, which cannot be done in a court case.   More life experience and maturity is required when making decisions that will affect someones entire life.
5947	Adults may make more reasoned decisions because they have had more life experience and have more maturity.
5948	You can't make objective decisions because only adult people possess rational and mature thoughts that is needed to make decisions that will affect someone else.

5949	No. There's a reason that you must be an adult to serve on a jury.

5950	First of all, if the message was not communicated clearly, as in the situation described, then the parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests. And how is someone who was not convicted of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
5951	If that is all there is to it then that outcome is completely bogus. There is NO problem with touching another person, however, there is a problem when a person touches a "bad" place, which is clearly not happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.  What SHOULD have happened? The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on how to not run into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society. There was no need for any trials or arrests.   And how is someone who was NOT CONVICTED (ie: innocent) of a crime forced to register as a sex offender? That simply doesn't make any sense at all.
5952	Although the story is bogus, there is nothing wrong with touching another person on the head, shoulder, leg, back, etc. There is only something wrong when a person touches a "bad" place which CLEARLY wasn't happening and was not going to happen in the middle of the street.

5955	We need to get rid of marijuana and get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit. The chances of getting it legalized is slim but at least the way things are going now. Banning smoking here and there, what you can and can't say, how things are cooked...we are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
5956	Oh, please give it up and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit. The chances of getting marijuana legalized is slim...well at least the way things are going now. Banning smoking here and there, how things are cooked, what you can and cannot say...we are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
5957	Oh give it up, and try to get something accomplished other than this useless pursuit.  The chances of getting Marijuana legalized is slim...well, at least the way things are going now.  Banning smoking is good but, is the smoking of marijuana okay? How things are cooked and what you can and cannot say are all good discussions.  You will need to control your every means of expression.
5958	On an issue like marijuana, the chances of getting it legalized is slim. As I understand from research, it will be legal, in the form of weed, but not as marijuana. Smoking weed, though, is allowed here, what kind of questions you can and cannot ask, who has the right to tell you how to wear shoes, what you can and can't say. We are in the "control your every way shape in mean for your own good" nanny state of mind now.
5959	One option could be to allow marijuana for medical purposes so maybe the attention and excitement about marijuana can be stopped.
5960	Polygraphs use a baseline and go from there. If your friend was nervous from the start then that would be his baseline. I measures changes not overall. The would have to be extreme for him to fail. Even if his English was not perfect, it shouldn't have any effect. I know you want to stand by your friend so do what you think is right.

I think you should stand by your friend. Have him volunteer to read for a different person from a different examiner.
5965	As contradictory as this statement may sound, I think affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination but is very necessary in some cases.  Believe me, I wish that the policies didn't exist, but then again, that would only occur/work in a perfect, non-discriminatory world.
5966	As contradictory as this statement may sound, I feel that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination but is very necessary in some cases. There is a lot of discrimination that still exists and it is something that the government should be addressing.  It would only occur in a perfect, non-discriminatory world...
5967	As opposed to the statement given, I think that affirmative action is definitely required in some cases, but is also very effective at promoting reverse discrimination. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field (i.e. in the business world, college admissions, etc.) is not as leveled as some people may think. Yes, black Americans (as well as other minorities) have come a long way from the old Jim Crow days, but there is still discrimination that still exists.

5975	It's the reason why prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from them.
5976	Prisons are built so that violent career criminals can be long-term incarcerated because those that commit crimes against society, like a robbery, rape, or murder, should be permanently confined.
5977	What difference would there be? Violent career criminals can continue to be released back into society to make room for nonviolent first-time offenders like deadbeat dads, drunk drivers with multiple misdemeanor convictions, recreational marijuana users caught with a single joint in their possession, scam artists who prey on the wealthy, etc. Whoever builds them, prisons should be for the long-term incarceration of major drug dealers, robbers, rapists, and murderers in order to protect society from these violent sociopaths.
5978	Violent career criminals should remain locked up and put to work. First time offenders should go back to the streets in order to build up the community and force them to learn how to be good people, instead of life in prison for nothing.
5979	As one Twitter user who has led a nonsmoker for 20 years said, "Do you know a smokin' brain is 30% smarter than a nonsmokin' brain? And because of the smoker's brain, smoking is 40% better than exercising and also as good as a medication. So... why stop a smoker who has already saved you enough money and time? I am going to vote for Bill on smoking, he has proven that smoking isn't bad for me. If only, if it was true, I would support both Bill and Tim.
5980	First you stop drug use and that is punishment, which certainly doesn't go there. Some people say you should be able to create laws that only those with a criminal record can buy drugs. I see the issue that drugs are expensive to produce and are bad for the environment, but this drug law is a completely legal answer to the current problem of drug addiction. Certain drugs like cocaine are seen as the evil of the world and should be prohibited, but if you can't afford drugs you don't need them. Drugs are still legal, so one could begin a discussion about having a price for such illegal drugs.
5981	First drugs are illegal so a punishment goes there. Under the use of drugs an act of crime occurs, but may not have occurred if accused was clean. Consider priors. Then put together a jail term and a drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence and less time for good behavior. Yes, you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
5982	First drugs are illegal, so it really falls under the crime law. If you got accused and innocent you will not face any punishment. But under the use of drugs an act of crime occurs, and that is probably the worst kind of law to follow. Consider priors you may have, and if the accused isn't clean it will be maybe shortened. Then put together a jail term and drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year jail term and less time for good behavior. Yes you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.

Yes you are right about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
5984	Drugs are illegal. If an accused was clean, no crime would have occurred. Considering his prior history, he might go to jail. A jail term and a rehab program would be a good punishment for using drugs. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence and a rehabilitation program. Yes you are correct about a killing being less time. That really stinks.
5985	People think there is censorship and lack of privacy here but have no idea what freedoms they enjoy compared to the people of China.
5986	Both sides agree on no demands for some immediate change.  China's actions toward its people, however, are harming the spirit of freedom itself.
5987	As a result, if America were to allow people to criticize China, the authorities wouldn't be able to ignore it.  They have to hear it, because people all over the world are seeing what is happening here.  If the people of China were given the same freedoms as Americans, the government wouldn't be able to ignore it.  It has to hear it, because people all over the world are seeing what is happening here.  If the people of China were given the same freedoms as Americans, the government would have to be thankful that it's given them the same freedoms as Americans have, and would have no way to censor them.  In reality, because of their obduracy, people like Terry Buitrago have had to pay a price for their views. Here's a quote from the The New York Post:  "Attention has been turned to Buitrago. Today's
5988	The world's individual governments all have the option to tighten or relax their social media laws.  They can't simply ignore these laws and remove or delete what they don't like.  Better to be loyal to China and not sell ourselves for party purposes rather than survive by offering little to our growing population with little or no improvement in life to come.
5989	This is a rather ridiculous question and it stems from thinking that because something is forbidden, it must be bad. The government has forbidden alcohol and prostitution because they know that many people abuse these substances. There is a specific problem here, but no need to falsely say that it is not free to drink alcohol or to have sexual intercourse.          More so, if alcohol and prostitution were allowed, the government is making an impression that it should be very easy to have sex in China, when it really isn't, and people here aren't very free to have sex. They do it because they cannot afford to say no.
5990	I agree that the child mental development is more advanced at a young age and needs special support during a particular period. {However the policy of the lockdown for the schools during school term lead to very negative impact on learning and mental development. and also many parents can't concentrate to learn new things.
5991	There are many factors that make a person to be intelligent and well trained. Children on the younger end of the age span are more sensitive to understand rules which direct their good behavior. When they realize they have to follow a specific rule or behavior, their rational judgment helps them better to think the outcome of the rule as well as it is informative to why they are choosing that action.   Some kids on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happen, or consequence of what they do.  Sixteen year olds are cognitively far ahead of a child who is 13 in every respect.

5993	Because children on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happen, or consequence of what they do.
5994	I agree with parts of both of the above answers. It has to do with the development of a child. It is usually during those years they go from concrete to rational thinking. That is why some subjects are not taught until children are older. Some kids on the younger end don't know the difference between right and wrong in many cases. They can have a hard time to know what will happen, or consequence of what they do. Sixteen year olds are cognitively far ahead of a child who is thirteen in every respect.
5995	Wal-Mart has one of the worst rating in terms of how they treat their employees. I know people who boycott them and have encouraged me to do likewise. They are not like Costco at all. Why would Californians want to encourage a store to treat its employees poorly? Why would they want to pay when the full-timers get cut back to part-time, lose their benefits, and go on Medicaid and use state-supported supplemental insurance plans (I'm assuming; I'm from NY)? Why would they want the related stress that comes with the anger and worthless feelings of being in such an environment so many hours a week? Why would they want them around at all?

6000	If it seems too good to be true, then probably it is. I would bump up to COMP and COLLISION as well in my opinion, I would also ask the agent for a copy of the policy itself, called a specimen policy, and look through it very carefully. It will spell out what you will and won't be getting in the policy. If you are comfortable with it then yes, go for it. Be advised, anything not covered by the policy in theory could be charged back to you. I work for an insurance company and have seen people lives ruined by not having enough or the right type of insurance. Bad things do happen to good people. I hope this helps.

6005	The current drug and disease ridden sex industry does pose some risks to its customers and employees, so a regulated sex industry with comprehensive health exams and HIV testing would be safer for everyone in a society that recognizes the sanctity of life.   Basically, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want to put society's "stamp of approval" on sex, yet most would feel otherwise about prostitutes.   Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons.  There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands.  Obviously, sex is not the same as prostitution, but many prostitutes are highly educated and professional.  Would you think it proper that more demanding and high quality options were available, or do you think the only acceptable forms of sex are something you can get cheaply off a stall?
6006	In our ultra-capitalistic society, you can give sex away for free, but you can't sell it. Yes, primarily it is for moral reasons. There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands. Basically, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want to put society's "stamp of approval" on it. Would anyone want their daughter to consider it "just a job" or an easy way to get some quick cash? Or would they want their husbands to be able to find no-hassle sex whenever they had some extra cash? How about the thought of your father casually going to a brothel after work? Some might not have a problem with these ideas, but most people would feel otherwise.
6007	To the question, "Ignoring the moral implications of this behaviour, would anyone want their daughter to consider it 'just a job' or an easy way to get some quick cash?",  I would say yes!  And there have been a number of legislative changes to combat prostitution (for more detail, please click here), ie:  13 states, and the District of Columbia now have laws that outlaw the distribution, sale, or ownership of prostitution related materials and many have laws against prostitution.  Also, it has become more difficult to put your hand in a brothel to beg for sex.  Hence, prostitution is often performed by blackmail, threats, and the like.
6008	Well, it's certainly not going away anytime soon is it?  Ironically enough in our ultra-capitalist society, you can give sex away for free, but you can't sell it. You can also donate or even pay to provide for sex, but these options are by no means common.  I'd say most people would prefer the freedom of simply giving it away.  That's not a big deal because for them, it's practically an integrated part of the town and they've made sex a fact of life. That being said, I'd like to point out that this has already been done in parts of China, as noted above.
6009	Hey, sex with strangers for free is cool. No one ever judging the society.
6010	Our minds can be not logical and even irrational. I do not see the point to death penalty. If someone kills one of my family members I would want him or her to face the ultimate punishment, but the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty. DNA tests are not the killsafe for the innocent people that are sentenced to death. So oppost it lest I or someone I know faces the fate of unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
6011	The emotional part of me supports the death penalty. I know if someone kills a family member, I would want them to face the ultimate punishment. But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not. Not all cases involve DNA, and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.
6012	Your whole family can stand to lose everything: your income, your home, your reputation, your chance at a new job, or you can do something more risky to make a bad situation even worse. As humans, we are willing to gamble to earn the next penny, the next hour or even the next day. But what is too risky for people to face is the death penalty. There are numerous cases of death sentences that are overturned, as well as innocent people that die from the sentence. When I think about this, I think that I wish the death penalty were abolished.
6013	Emotionalism is not reasoning. I know if someone kills a family member, I would want them to face the ultimate punishment. However, the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being sentenced to death. It involves a case-by-case evaluation and the program must be implemented in an orderly fashion. DNA isn't the keepsafe. DNA can't exonerate all offenders, even when the evidence is conclusive. It certainly can't eliminate the possibility that the offender is innocent.

6015	that depends on many factors. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs, a young man who was working hard for his future. Very sad. Drug use in general is psychological, it does not have to be very serious, sometimes it is just a coping skill. People who use drugs are often diagnosed with mental problems that are not very serious, but if they can cope with their illness that they have made they can better withstand the ups and downs of everyday life, which is harder for those who don’t have the required coping skills. A good example is alcoholics, some have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, but the alcoholics are trying to medicate for those illnesses. This shows that there are many issues other than drugs, it’s not just about drugs, other things prevent these people from getting into trouble or having a good life, but if someone can cope with their illness they will be better equipped to withstand the daily ups and downs of life. However, I’m all for treatment. Therapists help people get through life in various situations, and we can all get better. However, people can only go through treatment if they are willing to accept help, for repeat offenders, I offer no sympathy.
6016	That depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. very sad.. Personally, I think there's nothing wrong with drugs. The problem is the lack of supervision, and the acceptance. I don't think that's good either. I think drugs are for irresponsible people who act irresponsibly. Don't you think? I also think people who use drugs should get treatment that covers both addiction and treatment of the disease. But I think drugs are 100% justified because nobody is perfect. That's why I think people who use drugs shouldn't get sympathy, but treatment, whether they are or not.
6017	Drug use in general is psychological. There are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. Alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. This is a good example of peer pressure. Nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy? Society says, “Hell no, let’s go out and drink.” The problem with drug use is that you are covering one problem with another. Therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsion to use drugs. So yes, I believe in treatment. I believe you should help yourself. However, one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help. For repeat offenders, I offer no sympathy.
6018	Drug abuse is a psychological issue that needs to be dealt with by psychologists. Many alcoholics also show symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, which is an indication of a mental disorder. Peer pressure has an implication that drug users are acting sissy, even though the society may say no one wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy. Therefore, individuals who want to get treated for drug abuse have to be willing to take medication and accept help. There are many addicts who are willing to improve but cannot manage to do so, as the addicted individual will only receive help once he or she accepts help.
6019	Drug use in general is psychological and not physical. there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. for example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, which is a good example of peer pressure. society says, "well hell no, let's go out and drink". the problem with drug use is that you are covering one problem with another. therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsion to use drugs. so yes, i believe in treatment and i believe you should help yourself. however, one can only get treated if they are willing to accept help. for repeat offenders i offer no sympathy.
6020	If you get caught later on, you'll be fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you are going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you cannot afford to get fired. Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one. Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference. Good luck.
6021	Yes, if you're caught on the radar. You'll be fired and have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history. If you're going to make it, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired.  Get a short term job and then find a better one. Be reliable especially at short term jobs, but also use it as an opportunity to lay the ground work for a big-time raise in your salary. Good luck.

6023	Yes.  If you get caught later, you'll get fired.  In the future, you'll have to explain a larger gap in your employment history.  If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired.  Try a short-term job, if necessary, and then find a better one.  Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference.  Good luck.
6024	In your essay, you make lots of valid points.  If I were you, however, I wouldn't be so dismissive of women who were not thrilled with getting pregnant and of those wanting to go that route.  There is just something different about the background and circumstances of a woman who happens to get pregnant and decides to keep it rather than getting an abortion, which is a practice permitted on most levels of court law.  Having said that, you don't seem to take into account the great issues that go hand in hand with parenting on a different level.  Good luck on your writing assessment.
6025	The public could be required to have a preliminary hearing to determine corporal punishment, before an execution happens. It's somewhat of a contradiction as we're supposed to be getting rid of corporal punishment, but other countries practice the punishment. After determining it's legal, it would be required to have a hearing before executing a prisoner. The law would prohibit all executions, including executions. This is just bad for human rights for the criminals. It couldn't really be done and to force the government to carry out executions, is just not right.
6026	Public corporal punishment used to be executed in this country, the crime rate was lower but there were also a lot less people living in the country. I am not sure that is a good idea, but something has to be done, the crime rate is out of control. What's sad I think is that corporal punishment might work, but it would be a media circus and then in turn be useless. There has to be a better answer!

6028	There has to be a better answer, but I don't believe that corporal punishment would be effective. I don't think it would bring down the crime rate. As a society, we have made violence tolerable. This is partially because it can be seen as beneficial, but we can't go back to our old ways. We have to go one step at a time.

6030	If you did not fill out an accident report and your employer could argue that you did it at home, and you have not proof that you did it at work, it is best to visit your doctor to see if you are hurt and then report it to your employer. Because even a minor cut is important to report so it is best to visit your doctor for protection.
6031	When you do hire a lawyer, you better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle. Nine times out of ten, you lose. It's best to go to the chiropractor, keep your job, and mark this up as a lesson. When you tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more than losing your job, risk getting blackballed, and possibly getting fired, it's better to just let it go. If you fill out an accident report and your supervisor denies it, go to your employer and tell them what happened.
6032	Don't get into an accident at home. Even small cuts should be reported to your supervisor or your employer, and a few hundred dollars is worth more than losing your job and possibly getting blackballed for losing another cause. When you report your job, don't tell the truth - tell your current employer that you recently reported an accident at the old workplace. It could cost you losing your job and possibly blackballing you from gaining another one.
6033	on the job that is why even a minor cut should be reported to your supervisor or u have no case did u tell anyone that your back was hurting before u left work and if u did they have to sign an affidavit that u did hurt yourself on the job and put their job in jeopardy and risk losing their job too so if u do hire a lawyer u better be ready to fight a long and powerful battle and nine times outta ten u lose so its best to goto the chiropractor keep your job and mark this up as a lesson the next time tell someone a couple hundred dollars is worth more losing your job and possibly getting black balled from gettin another cause when u fill out an app i don't care what anybody says your ex employer can black ball u and tell them what happened and u won't get the job
6034	Please be honest, and report a minor cut to your supervisor. One of the most important ideas in putting together a cover letter is to let your applicant know that you care about them. If you really believe that they will give you a better opportunity, please let them know. Most people take their cover letter seriously and consider it a reflection of their professionalism. If you know that the candidate can provide an honest account of the situation, you can offer a fair deal. Because your candidate is not likely to be blackballed from their former employer, you have a better chance of getting the job because you have better options to choose from.
6035	D'ar friend,  I don't agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure that they would be subject to suit.   But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend,   Francesois
6036	To me, racial profiling was simply based on the fact that African Americans were more likely to get in accidents. If insurance companies were to charge all black customers more than white customers based on the fact that black drivers get in more accidents, I am quite sure they would be subject to suit. However, the police have the ability to take random actions like arresting someone or sending them to jail, and insurance companies can't do those things. So in law enforcement, discrimination just matters a lot more than it does in insurance sales.
6037	And it sure means a lot to me that you are concerned about the safety of your family and friends, and the welfare of those of us in your community.  I agree, discrimination in law enforcement is extremely problematic and it's very disheartening to see our president use national television to disparage illegal immigrants. It's especially disheartening because it comes from a place of deep political hatred and lack of consideration for the lawful rights of Americans. But I also want you to know that we are a citizen-neutral country.  I've had no problem buying insurance from a number of different sources, including both American and foreign insurance companies.  Also, if you really didn't want to insure with a particular insurer you could go elsewhere.  That's the spirit of freedom, isn't it?
6038	In comparison with the racism of law enforcement, insurance discrimination doesn't matter that much.  Insurance discrimination is not as important as racial profiling.
6039	All discrimination by insurers is quite out of the question because, if you look carefully, you will notice that a myriad of other companies offer the same services. Discrimination by law enforcement is something that matters tremendously because, if you pay attention, you will notice that a mere misunderstanding involving the name and the number of a telephone number can lead to the destruction of the life of an innocent man.
6040	Contact HUD and FBI.  You'll need documentation of your claims.
6041	It seems like it's, but Nope... no one is above the law... if he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau and the city for code violations... If he does have the cops and law enforcement in his pocket (that is shameful!) there's not too much you can do... I'd recommend staying away from him if at all possible.  A BETTER IDEA: contact your local news agency. Expose him on national TV! They love to expose people like this. It's good for their ratings and they would cause him to stop (hopefully) or at least lose his business licence, etc. My husband says to contact HUD and FBI. You'll need documentation of your claims.
6042	Our tax dollars fund HUD to help homeowners with foreclosure insurance, and FDIC to insure funds in our savings accounts. Tax dollars fund the police to serve us in fair and impartial manners.  In the end though, if there are crimes against other citizens, criminals will need to answer to the authorities. That being said, a person in good standing should not be evicted from his property by the police.   If a landlord is in default, then the landlord can be reported to the Better Business Bureau and the city for code violations. The landlord can go to jail for eviction as he did not get the proper legal process through the courts. The better idea would be to contact local news agencies for the local reports about the landlord.
6043	It seems like it, but no one is above the law. If he is a landlord, report him to the Better Business Bureau, and the city for code violations.

6044	Reporting him to the Better Business Bureau is beneficial. The city can also file a code violation, and there isn't much you can do if he does have his police and law enforcement in his pocket.  I would recommend staying away from him if at all possible. A better idea is to contact your local news agency, such as Fox News or PBS or something.  Expose him on the national level.  This can be very effective, and it can get such a thing like this to stop.  
6045	The laws are similar for anyone outside the United States if they cannot locate you.  However, it's important to note that US courts will give permission for them to collect on a judgment before it has been served.  So, you do not know if they can win a judgement, but if they do, you do not know if it will take them a long time to find your assets and get them to sell them.  So, I'm thinking you're safe. {But if all the money is outside the country in a foreign currency, a lot of these problems will probably arise.  There are courts that do not accept money in foreign currency, meaning that they are not going to enforce the judgement directly and you have to have it translated and if there is opposition, they may take it to a foreign court for enforcement, but that will take time. 
6046	Yes, they can sue you even if you are outside of the US; they can't sue you even if they cannot find you.  They can advertise the case in the newspaper in the area where they think you are.  So, if you don't show up in the suit, you don't know about the lawsuit.  Yes, they can win a judgment; but now they have a judgment in a US court for US money.  How will they enforce the judgment?  If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they can seize those.  But if all of your money is outside the country (which is actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money.  I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess.  So you probably aren't safe.  Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% safe.
6047	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
6048	Yes, they can sue you even if you are outside the USA. Yes, they can also find you even if they cannot find you. The courts will give them permission to advertise the case in the newspapers in the area where they think you are. So, if you don't show up in the court you don't know about. Can they win a judgment against you in a US court? Yes, they can. But now they have a judgment in a US court for US money. How will they collect the money? If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the USA, they can sieze those. But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought) it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money. I mean, they'll have to take the judgment to a foreign court and have it translated and it'll just be a mess.  So you're probably safe. Not 100% definitely safe but about 87% pretty much safe.
6049	It is possible to sue you if you are away from the US. You have to show up in a lawsuit in your area where you are and if you don't, you don't know about it, and can they win a judgment? Yes, but now they have a judgment in US court, so how will they pay?  If they can find assets of yours like bank accounts in the US, they will can sneeze it.  But if all of your money is outside the country (actually, even outside the state where the suit was brought), it is going to be a nightmare for them to collect the money. So you're probably safe.  But you can go back and pay them later as well, if you can't afford to.  So basically you should be safe.  Not totally absolutely safe, but about 87% safe.
6050	People shouldn't be excluded because of race because no two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it "more diverse."    Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much.
6051	What I mean is even within a single race, there are differences in appearance and skin color. Race doesn't matter that much.
6052	Within a "diverse" community, race shouldn't even be a factor.   Regardless of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race.     No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics.

6055	It's not illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, so there is no point in funding one. It's essentially a charitable donation to a for-profit company or a gambling venture that you can't win - you can possibly receive nothing in return for your investment, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all. The only benefit I can see is that if there is a revolutionary idea that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter. The only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

Why do this, exactly? Only for the pleasure of taking a risk? There is no point. It's just wasting our time if you ask me.
6060	There is a stigma in society towards marijuana, but even though it's illegal, some people still do it. This is because some people are more concerned about the negative effects on society as a whole than other people are. Alcohol and tobacco have negative effects on society as a whole, but going out and getting drunk, or just having some beers while watching a game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people, or to just relax. These aren't considered bad things when you're an adult, but it gets back to the theme of trying to make children responsible for their actions. Even though it's illegal it's a lot less likely to happen in the future. I think it's really unfair that it's so controversial.
6061	There is a stigma in society toward marijuana. Despite the fact that use of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana.  This societal norm is the only reason that marijuana is illegal and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with.

6062	There is a stigma in society toward marijuana but despite the fact that more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable.

CMV.
6063	Despite the fact that the usage of more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable, there is a stigma in society toward marijuana. I think the reasons why marijuana is still illegal are because it causes a lot of bad things to happen to people, especially to kids who are getting used to it, but even in states where it is legal, it's still considered a really strong drug and is not as acceptable in society as it should be. The statement in the first paragraph is wrong because caffeine and sugar are not considered more dangerous than marijuana. In fact, sugar is a healthy thing and it even promotes good health to some people. Marijuana is not healthy for anyone and has caused a lot of deaths that were not directly related to it. Alcohol and tobacco do not promote good health and actually have some harmful effects on people's bodies and also cause a lot of deaths that were not directly related to them.
6064	In my opinion, society doesn't need a stigma toward marijuana despite the fact that more dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco are socially acceptable. Actually, many scientists believe caffeine and sugar are more dangerous than marijuana.  This social norm is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and isn't allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington).

6065	Trust online sources more than physical ones because the people behind them are not accountable as they spread false information.
6066	There is no guarantee that information found online are more truthful than in publications such as a book or newspaper. We should be open to looking at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't. I just don't believe in that idea because there is no guarantee that information found on the internet is more truthful than in a book or a newspaper. I don't believe that there is any guarantee that we have to rely on information found online.
6067	What you saw on the internet doesn't mean that it is true. It is literally what it is. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't. I just don't believe in the assumption that it is of equal value with print media.
6068	I've never heard of an online spreader of disinformation. It has only been seen in books/sources/news channels/newspapers. I don't know why they put that sentence in then.
6069	We have to remember that there is no truth as such and that information is spread by people in a variety of different ways such as publications, internet, television and radio. We need to treat everything with an open mind and find out if it can help us or hurt us. I do agree with you that it's also important to trust someone to take care of the spread of information we get.
6070	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that probably their education rates are lower and their poverty rates are higher, but it doesn't matter. That's probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.  PS. Sorry for grammar
6071	Black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others.

6075	By keeping religions separate, you make your view point strong, and others are less likely to make a change just because they disagree with yours.
6076	There is also room for interpretation, but I think the world would be a better place if people made their own moral decisions instead of being prescribed to them by their religion.
6077	Prohibiting views that bring an advantage over other choices is in my opinion unacceptable. I’ve always felt that morals should be something like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. a Catholic’s morals would be different than an Atheist’s or a Mormon’s.People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribe them by their religion. I am not against religion, I just think your religion should not control your morality. This page is for being here, discussion, but not the religious sections because religious subjects are quite controversial. Some people think that morals are something that you learn from your religion. Opinions: Use the school uniforms rules if your school does so and there are no other clothing rules in the class. If there are other rules in the class then you need to either be in dress code clothes or nothing to cover your body and you must be in class in uniform every day. If your school does not allow you to wear a school uniform then you can dress however you want, just don’t show up at school in wet clothes. School uniforms, in general, should not be in the classroom, but school staff may decide to have a class meeting outside of the classroom to discuss school uniforms. Schools that have school uniforms may wish to have written rules or tickets to enforce the idea of uniforms. Schools that do not have school uniforms should communicate to parents how important
6078	Nor have any one religion commited atrocities such as barbaric killings such as genocide, all those who hold this belief must be read up on the history of the religion.
6079	Is morality is a matter of fine tuning? Should the world be governed by a code of morals that cannot be modified or updated? Are they really irreplaceable? If the very definition of the word moral is dictated by a religious text or set of rules, what purpose do they serve then?  It would be a waste of space and resources to merely provide an interpretation.  I suggest that our moral codes be updated regularly (six months or a year is my recommendation) by a committee of true believers that follow all of the precepts of the religions and all of the precepts of the people who are not religious.  Beyond this, we could include a new code every five or ten years that addresses new issues that have arisen in our culture. I feel that this process allows us to continue to engage in private discussions regarding each specific new issue. Because there is no one clear interpretation of the moral code, we do not lose our ability to explore, debate, and even disagreement.  The code would list all of the ideas, the positive and negative aspects of those ideas, and a consensus should be reached on which ideas to retain.  Your program begins with the initial situation outlined below, and then on each roll, you attempt to adjust the moral code. If you would like to go into any detail on what you believe is the moral code that should be at the top of each new roll, you can simply write what you would feel the most comfortable writing about.  Finally, on the final roll, we invite a different mode of thinking. We encourage the government to consider the value of this moral code to real people who are suffering from illegal abortions, unmarried motherhood, housing discrimination, prostitution, domestic violence, and so forth.  If you would like to discuss the specifics
6080	My vote is for promoting complex self-organizing matter as our ultimate goal. CSOM is a rarity in this universe and it needs our help. We could shoot rockets to mars loaded with millions of different species of microbes in the hope that some would survive and spread. Then hit the oceanic moons.  As stupid as that plan may be, it's way better than shuffling along with no species-level goal (other than the core goal of survival). If we just measure ourselves by how efficiently we turn food into people, as nature wills, we'll miss our chance at grandeur. Humankind isn't going to be around forever. We need to do something really excellent before we go extinct.  Religions offer goals but they get so many simple things wrong that they can't be trusted. Their goofy ideas should be ignored.  Please share your ideas for what Humanity's Ultimate Goal should be.

6085	Fox news is bad for my intellect because it makes it seem like dissenters with their ideas to me are bad. Now, I find myself not believing what it say because there are some biased opinions in there. I may think that Fox News is a great network, but I have to use a double filter before I buy into what they say. Because of this, I feel like I am unable to hear out good ideas, which is something that I do not like.
6086	Nowadays, Fox News is the lowest example of good, right-supporting reporting. They have singlehandedly shut people off from hearing good, right-supporting ideas. It is not something that I like.
6087	Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)? The one thing I agree with is that Fox is biased in a way that speaks to the personal views of the network owner. I also think they are a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be.

6088	My issue with Fox News is that they are extremely biased in their reporting in favor of conservative ideology. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)? Because of this, I feel like I am actually closing my mind to a lot of good, right-suported ideas. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like.
6089	If Fox News was a perfect news source, it would not be the low of news sources, but this is not the case since Fox news is biased in certain ways.

6095	This is a very narrow topic that focuses on college campuses and large cities. While large cities offer many conveniences, things like schools and libraries for students, they have the same drawbacks as public schools, i.e. larger class sizes, lack of social interaction in communities outside the classroom environment, and lack of social development outside the college environment. An alternative is to go to a campus that has a small student population because less students, also makes the task of connecting to students easier. It helps you develop stronger social skills. A college city is where college tuition is low and students can attend higher quality 4 year universities where you can take classes alongside those you will find many years down the road in real life.  __________________________________________________________  Your job search begins when you finish school. That means you’re done growing up. You can learn how to do things like set goals, time management, interpersonal skills, job interviewing, networking, and resume writing later.   However, once you graduate, you will have to learn how to manage your time in the real world, often at short notice, with limited and changing funding, sometimes in the form of grants and sub-grants.   In the course of your job search, it can be difficult to separate professional development from advancement, which is why it’s useful to lay down a path toward advancement before you start looking for a job. As you work on the strategy, you should also narrow down your job search to a manageable number of employers so you can take the time needed to explore a wide range of job offers.
6096	Colleges in large cities are usually cheaper than schools in small cities and suburbs. There are more places to live and interact with people your own age. As such, going to college in large cities is likely to provide better social skill training.
6097	To keep this a narrowly focused conversation, I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded from this discussion. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a "college town", considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion. I think students should be free to choose to go to a four year university in a major urban area or commuter campus, but that the open discussion of the pros and cons of both public and private four year colleges is important. In this example, I would suggest why in some cases college is needed more than high school, but I would not assert that college is better or superior to a traditional public high school.
6098	Going to a college with an LOT of students living near or on campus aka commuter school provides an inferior social education. As such, graduates of such school, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university.
6099	We must be able to close up our societies and learn from one another with the US still having millions of immigrants illegally in our country. Only a mindset of destruction will allow that to occur.
6100	If there was a high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? Adding the unemployed and the low skilled workers to the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages. CMV
6101	There is no need for more cheap labor, and business does it because they have an intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer.
6102	If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? While businesses should be doing what they can to get rid of redundant workers through furloughs, layoffs, and better-paid work, an influx of cheap migrant workers is unnecessary. There are already plenty of people willing to be hired on less than fair labor wages, and influxes of cheap workers create more competition between companies, forcing them to offer less pay. Giving jobs to cheap migrant workers and only paying them standard minimum wage is like offering the same job to more than one candidate. Employers compete on price, not quality. Lower wages for everyone - lower wages = lower expenses = higher profits = more money for the employer.
6103	It is impossible to force someone to show up in an economy with high unemployment like right now because cheap labor will put them in the job, which helps them in the long run. In countries like India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, the middle class is being abolished. Those countries can focus on growing and industrializing instead of getting involved in labor issues for foreigners because there will be a shortage of the Middle class when their labor doesn't grow and they have to import cheap labor. As a nation, we should be focusing on our own people. They have to grow first. But to do so, we have to educate them and take off the caps they are bound. Add tax breaks for people who are getting their college degrees. Have them get a job for a few years, then work at lowering the tax burden if they are making a decent wage. This way, they get jobs, and we get to keep our own people qualified for the work, as opposed to cheaper foreign workers.

6105	In my opinion, if the government seeks to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. I see this like this: To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). I do see this as a responsibility of the government. It is probably something that any modern state would say. If somebody is injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government denied them the means to defend themselves, then I think the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen.
6106	If the government sought to deprive me of the means (like a gun) to defend myself against people who seek to harm me or my property, then I believe the burden of responsibility to protect me falls on the government. To me what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). It means that the police need to show up within a 20 second period if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder. If someone is in injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I believe that the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen.

To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.

6110	Not everybody invents, but still the usual arguments can be made. Inventing knowledge is collective, meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I think innovation, or the ability to use such knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also think abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.
6111	Argument: If anything can be invented then a new idea must come from previous knowledge. Knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. For instance, laws of physics should be universal since they are hard to find, and innovation or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. There are also plenty of reasons why the intellectual property laws of some countries prevent innovators from gaining the economic rewards of their inventions.
6112	Eliminating intellectually property rights would result in a more confident and independent science that would be a benefit to society. This is to say, less money would be spent on fraud and research sabotage. Smaller research groups would become attractive to the industry and they would rather start their own group rather than trying to continue the same research in an old, boring research group with bad knowledge. New things will always be invented and discovered, as time passes. I believe that certain things should be made to be protected, while others shouldn't, because of the importance of the things created.
6113	Philosophers usually find that ideas developed in one field are applicable to another field. This enables the vast majority of human ideas to remain unused and unfinanced. Therefore, if I had a goal of creating some new economic system that would enable enough public servants to become generous enough, then I would be able to take ideas from any field, apply it to my specific goal, and hopefully arrive at something that would solve my problem. Moreover, even if I could not come up with a new idea, I would still have the money to maintain the society of those who had to get down to their grind in the first place, and the creativity that would flow from such a situation. In my opinion, the current system of corruption does not allow the government to really make better citizens of us, nor does it allow for innovation to come from the government. In this case, if I could make enough of my employees so that they became generous enough, then they could get a job that would allow them to fulfill their fantasies, instead of sinking into the corruption that leads to down payments on new automobiles. Furthermore, even if I did not change anything in this area, I would still have the creativity that would come from my employees having to work to obtain their daily expenditures. In this case, I would not only be more creative, but also have more money. We could even
6114	The usual con-argument is that anything that can be invented needs to come from previous knowledge. Knowledge is usually collective (laws of physics, previous discoveries/inventions), meaning that the result of applying such knowledge should also belong to mankind as a whole. However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such.

6115	Isreal is massively outnumbering the casualties on the side of the Palestinians because it doesn't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill on one criterium and that they kill if the person is from Palestine. If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify wreckingly kill them and CMV
6116	CMV
6117	As for the number of casualties, the casualties on the side of the Palestinians far outnumber the Isrealian side. They seem to care about the people of Palestinian but not the other side. The only thing stopping them from continuing their massacres is the international community. Once the Palestinians call for a UN resolution, the world will come together and the world will witness a civil war between israel and the Palestinians.  As for the world coming together to stop them, the world is already trying their best to stop them from fighting each other, but they have refused to listen to their calls. So with the consequences they are facing, they still refuse to listen to the calls of the world. Once the Palestinians canceled their request of a UN resolution, the world might come together to stop them.  They have started almost massacring the people of Israel alone, which has started to look like genocide. If what Hamas is saying is true, they have no obligation to stop these massacres. The world really should come together and take action against them.
6118	In point of view, killing people indiscriminately or based on one criterium is taking the shape of genocide. We don't have to look at numbers or counts. You don't have to kill if you do not want to. All I can say about the affairs in Gaza is that people have fallen down as if there is no limit or no mercy.
6119	Palestinian casualties outnumber those of the Isreali side massively. They don't seem to care if they are Hamas or Fatah or whoever, they are just trying to kill civilians regardless of their relationships with Hamas or Fatah. If Hamas is using their own people as human shield for them like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill the civilians they have used as human shield.
6120	At every job I have worked at, part time to full time, one is not allowed to have piercings or tattoos. They are allowed, however, any other piercing should be taken out. I also believe it to be rubbish to prolong the negative judgment behind piercings that are not on the ears. I understand if the context on either the tattoo or the jewelry have an offensive image on them, but if there is not then there should be no problem to show them at the work place. I believe the rejection of showing them only prolongs the idea that tattoos and piercings are for immature, wrongly rebellious and unprofessional citizens.
6121	 tattoos and piercings are frowned upon at workplaces where most people have respectable jobs that aren't unskilled.
6122	Only those that are current in their piercing/held in place and visible/not intent on rejection should be given work at work.
6123	At every job I have worked at, part time to full time, one is not allowed to have any piercings (this includes clear studs) or visible tattoos. Earrings are allowed, however, any other piercing is to be taken out. I think this is ridiculous because some of the tattoos and piercings might be of a negative image for the people they represent. I don't like other people's body art, but should they be taken out? I feel it is a statement that people might think it is inappropriate that you show your tattoos, and I wouldn't want my employer rejecting the tattoo. Earrings are fine.
6124	Although piercings are not always approved by employers, tattoos may be considered in some cases, especially when they are done for a religious purpose.
6125	What makes living things is not religion but biology. Freedom of religion is a false concept like the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you like. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful. Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference. Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic. Atheism is the absence of religion.
6126	Because of the selfish nature of religion, there are no religious liberties. The absence of religion is called atheism, not the opposite of religion.
6127	Religion is a false concept. It's like having the freedom to choose whatever perpetual motion machine you like. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful.  Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic.  Atheism is the absence of religion, not a form of religion, so as a non-believer I need no religious liberties.
6128	In point of view, religion is a false concept. It's like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real. A guarantee that they can do so is useless and wasteful.  I disagree with the preceding statement. I think atheists might not need religious liberties and proponents of religion would be stupid to insist on religious freedom. I think we should have a nation without religion. In that case, having a parliamentarian ensure that atheists do not receive benefits that someone with religious beliefs would get seems absurd.
6129	Because there is no freedom of religion, atheism is the absence of religion and as a non-believer I do not need religious liberties.  Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.  Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic.
6130	Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for requires proof of identity. So why not something as important as voting? Then there are even some who call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe laws. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities (IE someone who registers to vote but doesn't feel the need to get actual identity proof).
6131	I am hearing about this issue as a "hot button" issue in the media. I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are in fact of legal voting age is a fair requirement. Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for (car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting. Then there are even some that call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crow laws. I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities (ie someone who registers to vote, but does not feel the need to get actual identification.). Please change my view, thank you.
6132	If you don't have proof to prove you are really that person voting and you didn't go to the right school you can't vote. So you have to present a photo ID to prove you are voting.  It is the exact same system as any other adult you legally have to be certain age for in order to rent a car, drink alcohol, clubbing, driving a car, traveling by airplane, or basically anything else.
6133	If you register to vote, then make sure you prove that you are a citizen. If you receive bad legislation that makes voter identification very difficult or impossible to obtain then that's a problem with the government and not the people's rights to vote.  Yet, sometimes people get fined that shouldn't have been fined or people get banned for voting.
6134	It's a hot button issue in the media. I feel that there should be to voter ID laws because it shows that it's important to have a well-managed society that enforces the law.  However, if someone did not want to get ID then it's understandable for them to have it.
6135	Yes, the only reason we still use 12-hour clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
6136	If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12-hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. There is no need for a modifier like "am". It makes calculations with time easier. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.). From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hour clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
6137	I believe this concept originated before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time. I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system.  However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.).  From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hour clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.
6138	If I understand my history correctly, the idea of a 12 hour clock is basically a relic from a time before we had better ways of measuring and keeping track of time.  I don't see any benefits in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like "am". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.)  From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hr clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change.

6140	My opinion is that fascism would become prosperous, with a great leader.
6141	If Fascism still existed and a competent and great leader, such as FDR was in control it would become prosperous.
6142	I think that Fascism can be a positive and good thing for a nation and it's people if it is done correctly with a great leader such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, obviously it doesn't work with horrible people like Hitler or Mussolini but what about Hideki Tojo, in my opinion he was a pretty good leader with his people's hopes in front of him, only to make bad choices by supporting the Axis. Though he still knew when it was time to give up and even stopped causing the blood of his people to be shed after seeing the destruction of the atomic bomb. So what would happen if Fascism still existed, with a competent and great leader in control? My opinion, is that it would become prosperous.
6143	It's a pretty good point in terms of what to choose for your future career. I think if you will not only study for a few years, but also do some internships after graduation. I would also think you should begin working in your chosen profession right after you graduate in order to gain hands on experience. That way, you can begin to figure out if you really want to do this profession or not. This way, you won't waste your years in school searching for a job in what you really don't want.

6145	There shouldn't be laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there (i.e. This does not apply to another persons private property, where they would have final say).  CMV.
6146	We see naked animals all the time, and that sex is how most animals procreate is common scientific knowledge. Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with little to no issues. People are basically high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn shoots is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating parties in any way. Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there (i.e. This does not apply to another persons private property, where they would have final say).
6147	First of all, most animals can have sex. And all animals procreate by having sex. Also, people are very high functioning animals, and the existence of nudist/sex clubs is proof of that.  Nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating parties in any way.  Second, people have final say about how we dress, unless the other person owns a piece of private property, in which case I think they have final say.
6148	While there are obvious instances of zoophilia and bizarre antics of all sorts, most of the time we ignore them because they don't affect us directly.  Animals are obviously high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn shootings is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating parties in any way.

6150	Yes, it is a mistake to pay a person minimum wage when the job requires some skill.** Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc** **However, there is a rise to the management level who manage a few people in a workplace**
6151	Employers are for profit companies that rely on minimum wage jobs to get cheap labor to pay the expenses of the company. If they can't find someone with better skills who will perform better for less, then they will pay more to find someone with better skills. This is a business decision, not a personal decision.
6152	This whole argument is based on those who are in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc.
6153	If an employer chooses to pay the minimum wage required by law, how can he expect more than what is required? Especially when the job actually requires some skill or intellect in the first place. **Employer** "Can you give 110% when working?" **Employee** "Are you going to pay me 10% extra?". **Employer** "No." **Employee** "There's your answer then". **This whole argument is based on those who are only in minimum wage employment for money, it doesn't count if it's an apprenticeship or internship etc**   **This won't involve cost to any employer whatsoever.**

6155	Keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them. Entirely rejecting ideas only serves to stifle the creative process. The creative process requires open-mindedness for effective development.
6156	When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them. Entirely rejecting ideas or the weaker associations between different ideas only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively.
6157	Throughout the process of creative thinking, it is best to keep all the ideas that come to mind (even the weak ones) in mind because, ultimately, all ideas count. By rejecting certain ideas or associations between ideas, one is only stifling one's creative process. Consequently, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
6158	When considering how to generate creative solutions, it is best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them.

It is best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them, even though one is initially overly enthusiastic.
6159	When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them (one should keep them in mind and only qualify them to varying degrees).

Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively.  Do you agree or disagree, and why?
6160	Snap! I think that the Hulk would be tough. The Hulk has strong muscles but without a brain, he wouldn't know when to stop.
6161	I'd have to vote for The Hulk because The Hulk is extremely strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why Thoughtprocess is so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near insanity. This is why he's always wrong on the issues! ;o) I think you're right about that though, he's strong, but I'm just WAY stronger. I bet he wouldn't even try to get close to me. But good point. :o)) Why don't you go hang out with a real adult person instead of wandering around working on silly Barney Flagg's wishes? Sure they don't know much but still an adult person to you. That would be better for you. Wouldn’t this be fun? TSHITZ can wait until I get my house cleared out, then we can do a SmackDown Live star ing you as the Justice League! LOL]. Probably be able to get enough materials for a cheap tyre out of old tyres and torches, some canvas and zips, possibly old electronics. I'm thinking... go out to the foreman's bedroom and blow up the walls....got insulation, air hose, 5.5 v aki inverter with a portable dc outlet. Anyway you can do that, kind of like in that tv show's home invasion, and
6162	Anytime the Hulk gets angry, she becomes so powerful she can press 105 lbs over her head. This is why TP's momma is so strong. Every single defeat I hand her, along with the fact that I can push 105 pounds over my head compared to her paltry 100 pounds enrages her to the point of near – insanity. This is why she's always wrong on the issues! ;o)
6163	You should feel proud of the fact that you're such a skilled hacker. At least, when people hear you talking like that, they don't think you're rude or spiteful.
6164	Oh snap, yeah. She's incredibly strong and gets stronger the angrier she gets. This is why his thoughts are so strong. Every single defeat I hand him, along with the fact that I can press 105 lbs over my head (compared to his paltry 100 lbs) enrages him to the point of near - insanity.

6165	EXCUSE ME! WOW someone is very aggressive. Me? Nah I tell the truth. I'm 17 years old. Very athletic. Joined the Army reserves recently. And I'm a straight A student who might occasionally receive a B+. So I don't think I'm retarded, which I think accusing people of being retards is a very rude thing to say because retardation is an unfortunate thing to happen to anyone and there are real retards out there, and I'm entering my senior year of high school meaning I haven't dropped out. And since I'm active and very athletic I'm not a lazy fat ass. Thank you very much!
6166	Can I help you?
6167	I'm not acting like a retard because I'm not lazy and I do not have the body type that retards have. I have a very athletic body because I'm active and I have been in the Army reserves for the past few years and I have yet to receive a C+ for any assignments. I'm a straight A student because the person that wrote the previous comment was extremely rude.
6168	what should I do, like, I couldn't find a girlfriend. Should I just tell my mom? And if so, will that ruin my chances of finding one in the future?
6169	Sorry! Someone is very aggressive.. Me? Nah. I tell the truth.. 17 years old. Very athletic.

6170	Dark Knight is a grand epic, but Year One’s strength is in its subtleties. It’s more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli’s realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation. My only complaint is that they should have made more than four issues.

6175	If there was a terrorist group in our homeland, then wouldn't you want help? The same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for the US.
6176	If there were terrorists in our homeland, then wouldn't you want us to do something? It's the same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for the US.
6177	Think about it. There are innocent people in Darfur who are being slaughtered without mercy, and we are allowing it to happen. Consider this: if there were a group of terrorists in our homeland, would you not want help? The same scenario for the people in Darfur, they want help, but they aren't getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for the US.
6178	We should. Consider this: if there were terrorist groups in our country, wouldn’t you want aid? It’s the same scenario for the people in Darfur. They want help, but they aren’t getting it. Also, if we lend a helping hand, then it will put in a good word for America.
6179	But if you already assume that there are innocent people in Darfur who are being slayed without mercy, then you wouldn't want to lend a helping hand. That's because you'd feel that you are assuming the worst. There is one scenario where we would like to lend a helping hand. If there were terrorists in our country, we wouldn't be afraid to help them? That's the same with Darfur, there are innocent people who need our help and to help them put it in a good word for us.
6180	It's impossible to make a judgment on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation. I don't like Obama but we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse.
6181	Obama is not a great leader. We've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than him.
6182	Most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People's behavior is always influenced by their environment and the current situation. As such, any assessment of Obama's leadership should be made from the context of his presidency and with the correct perspective.

6185	If you were rich, you could live at whatever standard you chose, you could go on vacation, you could feed your interests and hobbies, and live whatever life you wanted.  If that didn't do it for you, you could give a bunch of money to the poor and people would like you anyway.  If you still felt insecure about things, you could hire a coach and stuff so you wouldn't be, and your friends around you would make you feel better, especially if you used that money for a good cause.

6188	It is a choice for people who are at the top of society, to live at the whim of their wants. If you were to give money to poor people in such a situation, you would make them feel even more insecure, which means they would only want to take money away from you when they were feeling bad. I suggest you use this money to have some classes or attend events so your life is not boring.

6190	Teens and younger people who allegedly don't deserve it should be subject to this same law. For the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
6191	People acting like sex offenders, paying large penalties, serving jail time, etc. Those rules were developed for real pedophiles. If young people are being harassed like these people, so they deserve to be punished, for the reason they choose to act in such a way and deserve to be taught a lesson. Things are being taken for granted too much within this generation.
6192	Theres always two sides to anything... when u think that there u need to reach out to the victim's family and help them cope with what has happened to them. Otherwise the only thing you can really do is come to the aid of the accused rather than the victim.. but don't be a crook...and if ur a sex offender go to prison. Just because you feel threatened doesn't mean that you're a danger to others...and they should not be able to so easily say that they will never do it again. 
6193	Replacing registration with this penalty is not what this bill is about. This bill only addresses some criminal behavior that has been highlighted.
6194	Teenagers and young people in general are the subjects of too much "free love" for the older and wiser generations as the younger generation expects them to be "open" and then throw away the information, for the reason that they simply don't want to be responsible for a decision made in a couple of hours of time.
6195	There is no need for it to be a crime in itself. In a Catholic Church once the egg is fertilized it is considered a baby. So I think it is not an offence to kill a baby without any chance of it having a choice. We should also think about more money for adoption agencies and less for seniors. I see from an outside perspective the issue that is the baby. I think you have to support the children. If someone was raped or it's incest, they should still have the baby because it is still a live and it still a baby.
6196	As a Catholic, I have to say that it should be illegal. Because it is against my religion to kill innocent babies. In the Catholic church, once the egg is fertilized, it is considered a baby. So I think killing a baby, and it not having a choice, should be illegal and you should go to jail. From other religions, it might be against your religion. But I still believe that it should be illegal. If you know you cannot support your baby, you should put it up for adoption. I also think that the government should be putting more money into adoption agencies and less into seniors. I know that seniors have been alive and been important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future. If someone was raped, or it was incest, they should still have the baby, i mean it is still a live and it still a baby.

6200	I will be arguing that we should kill the one person. My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them. My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.

6205	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society and advertisements remind us of all the things that we don't have and makes us feel inferior for not having them. The news distrusts us and makes us think that we can't trust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with. We have people screaming at salesmen because we don't see them as the same as us and what makes them so evil but the pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone. We kill because of our frustration with our own lives and our distrust of each other's feelings, we kill and just wish they would go away. People take their own lives to express their hatred and disgust for the world. It's not video games, it's television programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities because they are close knit and know one another better, and less murders and personal tragedies because people are more friendly to each other.

We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends we wont have, products we cant afford, and movies full of lives we wont live.

We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live. It's not video games, it's television programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
6209	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society. Advertising makes us feel inferior about the things we have and what we do not have. The news makes us distrust each other and our distrust causes us to treat each other as if they are not people, but things to be interacted with. People scream at salesmen, why? Because they see them as the same as them. What makes a telemarketer so evil but the modern pressure of modern living forcing them to not let you off the phone. We kill because of our own lives, we feel unhappy because we do not have the things we want, we are frustrated because the images we see of our friends and family are just not the same. It's not video games but tv programming and society that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities. There are less murders in large cities because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
6210	Opera has a lot of good features, but it's recognition is extremely low. For example, Speed dial puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it's recentlly rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
6211	Opera is the best browser. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take "connect with opera" for example. It places your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. Also, it was recently rated very highly in CPU magazine, with its only flaw being it's lack of add ons, which is greatly increasing. It is releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
6212	---Could we have someone to take the place of Internet Explorer--I can't say IE is better than Opera. I generally prefer IE, but I have noticed that newer versions of Opera tend to be better than IE 7 and IE8. Opera 9.52 will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of its competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that until recently people were willing to pay for it.
6213	Opera is great. It has all the features of all of the browsers, but it has the least recognition. Take " speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a new blank tab. It also has many add ons, but the community is only beginning.

In fact, Opera is such a good browser that until recently, people were willing to pay for it.
6214	--Coz Opera is really good! I use to just go with IE, but since Opera is so good, I now use Opera.
6215	Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious war in history. The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same number of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
6216	The real measure of "badness" would be to consider the current good lives of the people who have been murdered. Thus a religious war that killed half the population of a country a thousand years ago would be considered worse than a modern day terrorist attack that kills more than half the population of the country and ceases to exist after a few days.
6217	Many people think that religion causes much more misery and world wars than religion itself because religion can kill huge numbers of people. Since religion itself has been a factor in the deaths of millions of people throughout history, a better way of judging its "badness" is to compare it to secular governments. Surely, secular governments cause much more misery than religious governments?
6218	Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious war in history. One of the reasons that so many people consider secular governments to be more evil is because they kill a vast percentage of unbelievers. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
6219	Religion is a more nefarious government than any secular form of government. However, there is no guarantee that religions will preserve their power or dignity as they continue to be ravaged by human beings. One thing that I think is wrong in that paragraph is people who go to universities to be educated. The human race is also achieving great strides in medical education. The chance of a person being educated is not easy to control.
6220	Love is nothing more than a chemical reaction. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? At least for a period of time. Look at adults. Some of them fall in love and get married, and then divorce. The same thing is true for teens. Only slightly different. Love comes a while after teens are together. I can agree that teenagers can fall in love, get married, and then divorce. It is the same thing, just slightly different, for teenagers only. It's not too late.
6221	Love is nothing more then a chemical reaction in the brain. So, who is to say that teens can't fall in love? At least for a period of time. Look at adults, some of them fall in love and then get married and divorce. It is the same thing with teens only slightly different. Love comes a little later but eventually does. I can agree that teens are only interested in each other for a period of time before the other is not interested. I say that love can develop after a few weeks. Who is to say that teens are too young to feel that way?
6222	Love is nothing more than a chemical reaction in the brain. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? It is a chemical reaction that occurs in the brain. So no one can say that we aren't teenagers because we are not actually physical adults like some of the rest of the world. This is one of those things that teenagers experience.
6223	love is nothing more than a chemical reaction that the teenagers can't control. So who is to say that teens can't fall in love? At least for a period of time. Look at adults. Some of them fall in love, get married, and then divorce. It is the same thing with teens only slightly different. Love comes after teens have been together for some time.
6224	Love comes a while after teens are together, maybe the time varies. The few that do stay together after that initial reaction fades. Who is to say that it isn't love? Who is to say that teens are too young to feel that way?
6225	It is unwise to prevent people from looking for solutions to a problem of this nature and to only allow them to view it from a the world view.
6226	Who can say unless you're in the situation, but I truly do believe that if someone has a hostile situation at hand, or if someone was grabbing by one of the hands or legs, or had been placed in some situation in which they may have been hurt, or more, then it would have been dangerous for the person to turn back and nothing that the person would have done would have been any worse than what the person has seen or learned. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance.
6227	To turn one's back on a hostile situation and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature. But I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance.
6228	If it was me. I'd like to think I would have intervened. Who can say unless you're in the situation, though.
6229	In my opinion, instead of focusing on the consequences or learning from the situation, it was unprofessional and unethical to turn one's back on a situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services. I'm not saying that every intervention must be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop and offer help when we see an accident or to offer assistance even if it means a situation escalates into a true risk of violence.
6230	Will some of baseball's records be broken because of this? Probably. But so what. The Hall of Fame is a museum that chronicles the history or baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of'suspected' steroid use is ridiculous. It is crazy to let one person into the Hall because we "don't think" they took steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
6231	For a 20 year span starting in about 1985 or so, steroids were prevalent in Major League Baseball. Will some of the baseball records be broken and changed because of this? Probably. But so what. The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history of baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of 'abuse' of steroids is ridiculous. It is a crazy idea to let one person in the Hall of Fame because we don't think they used steroids, but prevent someone else from entering because we think they did.
6232	By the way, many baseball records are only significantly broken when the Hall of Fame period is not included. I think it should be changed, although there is a legitimate argument for keeping the period.
6233	There will likely be records for former players that were set by performance enhancement drugs. But so what. The Hall of Fame is, in effect, a museum that chronicles the history of baseball, good and bad. To omit someone from the Hall of Fame because of "suspected" use of performance enhancement drugs is ridiculous. It is crazy to let one person into the Hall because we "don't think" they took performance enhancements drugs, but prevent someone else from entering because "we think" they did.
6234	More important than baseball records being broken is the character of the record keepers. Pitiful people who can be persuaded into cheating to beat an opponent only to cheat themselves and, more importantly, impose their dishonesty;s will not be allowed to control the world.
6235	This debate has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women and here we are, looking at the mother has to raise children. Children choose to live with mothers or not, in the court or in an out of court statement, and i don't think you have to agree with them or not. Maybe i am just too country for this.. but i think all people are created equal.
6236	This debate to me has no moral. Most MEDC's are looking to bring equality for men and women. Here we are looking at women have to raise children. Children choose in the court or in an out of court statement who they would like to live with. If the mother is in a mental state then who is she to raise children to be somebody one day. Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, i think they MUST STEP IN.

Maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, I think they MAYST STEP IN.
6238	In the context of equal rights for women, the proposal to raise children only by men with mental health problems is false. Such a decision should always be made by the mother.
6239	It has been seen that some cases of sexual assault or child molestation are committed by fathers. So, maybe you should say that in most cases children opt to live with mothers, but there are some cases were fathers step in and personally, i think they MUST STEP IN.
6240	It is hard to say what is wrong with the service, but I think it has to do with attitude. I don't think it could be worse than the waitresses at Taco Bell or McDonald's or any of the other chain places.  It must not matter to them, because other places I have not been to in Manhattan, and they are just as rude.
6241	Here is the most stupid restaurant patron I have ever had.  I went here with a group of 6 people on a Saturday afternoon and it was supposed to be our final stop before the full weekend and we were only supposed to get two rolls.  First, when we ordered, a waitress (red hair and looked like she belonged in a crack den) came over and asked if we needed service.  No! We were supposed to get two rolls and we couldn't get in there because there was no place to sit.  That should not have happened.  I told her to call for one to come out and she got very angry, but told me it was my problem and called for the unattended server.  When we arrived and made our rounds, we thought nothing of it.  If we had gotten served, it wouldn't have mattered what color your hair or where you belonged.  As far as service goes, I cannot complain.  Ordered our rolls and decided to leave.  When we were just a few tables down, the red hair waitress came out.  We thought nothing of it, but the waiter looked like he was in a hurry and we ordered our food.  It took about
6242	The food is still tasty, but the service is terrible and only makes a problem when there is a holiday.  For example, yesterday, we went to dinner at 11:30 and the place was quiet when we got there.  The waitress came running over to us and acted impatient and rude.  We tipped her a little extra because she was our good luck charm.
6243	Ok....I still love the food, but I stopped going here because the service sucks. To show how bad things are, a waitress we had (red hair and looked like she belonged in a crack den) was rude and kept acting like we were an inconvenience. Even when I went to pay she was a little snarky. That being said, I still over tipped because it is a holiday.
6244	The service at this restaurant sucks. Case in point:  I went today with a small group and the place was not busy at 1pm, but the waitresses acted like they were still slammed and the place was still filthy.  The waitress we had (red hair and looked like she belonged in a crack den) was rude and kept acting like we were an inconvenience.  Even when I went to pay she was a little snarky.  That being said, I still over tipped because it is a holiday.
6245	This place is bad. We walk in and no one acknowledges us for over five minutes, but employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a ten minute wait. We waited a few minutes and then they said it would be a fifteen minute wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady manager.
6246	This place is bad. We walked in and no one acknowledged us for about 5 min, then employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 min wait. We waited a few min and then they said it was going to be a 15 min wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills. Especially what I would think was the marketing guy.
6247	There was a guy with no time, but the rest of us waited for 3 hrs...The men who were there and working, were terrible, rude, yelling with no ability to say more than 5 words at a time. The girl who was supposed to look after us made a comment that she was happy in her job. What kind of a chime job is that? The kids were cute but the lunch was terrible. If you can find better life chances better place to work for the Americans.

6250	Really good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries next to Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down. I just wish this place has gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after!

6255	I've eaten at the Zen for almost a year now and it has been my favorite restaurant so far. Since my last review I have tried many different foods and always found them my favorite compared to anywhere else.  Every time I go here I am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had nice conversations with Steven (hope that's correct spelling), begging him to open a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often.   Some of the foods I would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delicious selections though.  If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat I highly recommend The Zen.

6260	Surprisingly good!  Not sure why so many negative reviews for this place but that certainly wasn't our experience. We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated immediately. The place filled up over the next 15-20 minutes but our server remained efficient, competent and helpful.  We ordered the 2-for-$35 bbq platter and it was awesome!  Ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, a hot link and an assortment of sides. The tri tip, ribs and chicken were excellent and I never even got around to the pulled pork.  Honestly, better bbq than any place we have back home. Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store. All in all, I was more than pleased by both the food and the atmosphere.

6265	All of our expectations were met. I watched Gordon Ramsay’s YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream come true. We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it, I’d say it’s the most tender meat you’ve ever had. It seems that the flaky shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It’s very delicious, just not what I expected. Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!

6267	As an Executive Chef I have to say that Beef Wellington is truly unbelievable. So many chefs in the industry didn't know what Beef Wellington was and I expect very few could now tell me what it is.  Since I was in Houston I couldn't stop going to Gordon Ramsay's website and watching his videos. There's a video from the Desi US on Beef Wellington that is made even more interesting. I especially like how he gets most of the flavors up front in a roast pot. He can put on that steak for hours and it still isn't quite cooked through. So many times people throw the top layer of the meat away thinking it still needs cooking. I tend to follow chef Ramsay a little too closely, but if my family would have liked the dish I would have followed his lead this time instead of my customers'.

6270	To start off, this was my first time at a Tim Horton's and heard good things. We went for breakfast before our train back to the States. I had the BELT (Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato) on a pretzel bagel. The bagel did not taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found. My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. This thing was TINY and would have made an Egg McMuffin look big.  Somehow they ran out of hash browns but didn't realize it until after we paid. They offered us a doughnut instead but we didn't want that. The coffee was so hot that you couldn't hold the cup more than 10 seconds. Because that we had to throw it out. We were already delayed and had to catch a train so we chalked it up as a loss.
6271	My first time at Tim Horton's had heard good things but didn't realize that the hash browns ran out of. We had our breakfast before catching the train back to the states.  I had the belt bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato bagel on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel didn't seem fresh and I couldn't find the eggs.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast.  This thing was so tiny that it would have made an egg mcmuffin look bigger.  A very urgent reason for a very urgent decision, reached rather quickly.  Somehow the coffee pot happened to run out.  They had to offer us a doughnut instead.
6272	The staff at a Tim Horton's was rude. I had a friend go there for a breakfast and then go to a hospital because they either ran out of milk or had run out of doughnuts.  They didn't realize it until after they said they were missing doughnuts for their customers and had had no time to buy any.  This is just unacceptable.  I can't stand rude employees and it isn't hard for the customers to see that the staff is rude and should not be around.
6273	First of all, this was my first time at a Tim Hortons and it had been good news.  We went for breakfast before our train back to the United States. I had the bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato on a pretzel bagel.  The bagel didn't taste fresh and the eggs could barely be found.  My girlfriend had the bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. This thing was tiny, and it would have made an egg and waffle look big.  However, somehow they ran out of hash browns, but didn't realize it until after we paid.  They offered us a doughnut instead, but we didn't want that.  The coffee was too hot, and we had to throw it out.  We were already late, and had to catch a train, so we chalked it up as a loss.

6275	Being in a uniform is bad because it makes you look unattractive and you cannot express yourself as much. So band uniform OK
6276	It is not good to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so it's better to band school uniform OK
6277	We should let our students wear their school uniforms because they create a uniform in the school and they can't express themselves enough so they are fine. I think school uniform is bad because it makes you look unattractive.
6278	My opinion is that wearing a school uniform is not a good idea because it makes you look unattractive. You also can not express yourself enough so for me, band school uniform OK
6279	I do not think it's bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look at ease. Also, you can express yourself.
6280	No one can beat freesky in every way
6281	The F-series is better for my needs in every aspect.
6282	FF is better for my use in every way.
6283	No matches. FF is better for my use in every way.
6284	No need to use FF because my use for it is better.
6285	Yes it depends on how many people she kills. Well, I can't say much about someone who kills everyone because I am absolutely sure I would never do it. So to answer your question, I am pretty sure it would still be scary to sleep with someone if they killed someone.
6286	It depends on what she did. If she killed someone that deserved it she still would be scared to sleep with her. So, that's a maybe / maybe not situation.
6287	Well, it all depends...like, if she killed someone that deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with them. So, this is a maybe, maybe not situation.
6288	Well, it all depends...like, if she killed someone who deserved it, it would still be scary to sleep with her, so this would be a maybe/ maybe not situation... So yeah, I'm not sure.
6289	Well it all depends on her lifestyle. Like if her lifestyle is such that she deserves to die well it would still be scary to sleep with her so this is a maybe / maybe not situation. So yeah I'm not sure
6290	No. I couldn't imagine being in a situation where I'm turning on my spouse and they're not saying anything. Like if I was doing something like killing someone, it would be for a good reason.
6291	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if I were to do something like that she would be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
6292	Unless he knows or cares about what's good for her, I would not think it would be appropriate to take his life.
6293	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if I were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
6294	No. I could not imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that he would be right there next to me not saying a word. He would be defending me no matter what, because he loves me. Plus if he were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
6295	if you wanted to buy a tv, it would be really expensive and you have to buy a TV licence, books can help you learn a lot of stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids, so books are a better option
6296	To switch to book would be a safer choice than watching TV. It is much cheaper than TV. Moreover, books can help you learn a lot about the world, history, human drama, etc. TV is quite violent and a large portion of it is directed at children. So it is definitely better to read a book than to watch TV.
6297	books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book. If you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence. Books can help you learn lots of stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are well better.
6298	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
6299	My favourite book is Harry Potter, because it has an amazing plotline, and I really like the characters. I would like to read more of it but I have no money. I would also like to see more movies about it, because they have really amazing designs and filming.
6300	When new technological developments emerged books has its fixed place in every hearts, but we shouldn't forget that there are some other things that can beat books as well.
6301	Bookstores have their place in human hearts but the importance of books will not change with the emergence of new technologies.
6302	[Throughout human history] books have had a fixed place in every human heart.
6303	Any new technological developments will not replace or replace books but rather supplement or supplement books. Books will always have a place in every human hearts, and any of those new technological developments is better than books if
6304	Books will always be great and everlasting so no matter what technological developments the human's can see in the next hundred years, they will still be able to read them.
6305	India cannot lead a country, because it cannot be on top in anything, especially in defense and arable land. Even its a rich country and has many resources available like diamonds, blue sapphires, oil, uranium and gold, but nobody gives any importance to those things because of laziness. Why should I give importance to some things of which I cannot use the resources?
6306	As you have never read the constitution, you may find the 70 percent claim misleading. In fact, there is a fundamental difference between guns and tanks or a base. Tens of thousands of men can be trained to defend a base or enough food to last for a year or two. This is precisely why your legislature would not authorize the acquisition of a navy. A house that claims not to be restricted by constitution is a house of ignorance.
6307	In the subject of development we can't rely on the second or third rank for development because of the people are lazy they don't have time to think about the country's development, they are happy at their homes. I strongly believe that India cannot lead. The Indian people talk about the 7th, the third and second rank in areas of defense and arable land but here we are talking about the Supreme power we can't rely on the second or third. Moreover the people are lazy they don't have time to think about country's development they are happy at their homes.
6308	I strongly believe that India cannot lead the world in any area defense. You people are talking about the 7th, 3rd, 2nd ranking of India in area defense and arable land respectively but here we are talking about the supreme power we cannot rely on 2nd or 3rd. Moreover, the people are lazy, they don't have the time to think about country's development, they are happy at their home.
6309	There are many ways to measure national power. There's the size of the land a country has, the area of an armed force it has, and the technology it has. All those measures are important to people, but to us, the actual capacity to apply your force is the most important. Only the greatest people can do that. India can lead the world in so many ways, but on that subject alone, I don't think it can.
6310	Well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first so there is no question of leading the world so far. However, if we compare, let's have a look at the following points:  1. almost 90% of India is illiterate, so an illiterate country can't lead the world.  2. India is more into castes, politics, religions, and less into development.  3. the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself. So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
6311	India is finding difficult to manage itself. So there's no question of leading the world, so far. But still, if we compare so lets have a look at the following points: 1. almost 90% of India is illiterate, so an illiterate country cannot lead the world.... 2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. 3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself.... So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
6312	It’s hard to think India will lead the world when it can’t even manage itself first. Most Indians are illiterate, so an illiterate country can’t lead the world. There’s a caste system in India, politics in India, religious divisions in India, and India lacks confidence on itself. If these issues continue to exist, it is difficult to think India will lead the world when it can’t even manage itself first. There’s some purpose in cursing itself because of the past of its culture.
6313	Even though India is still an illiterate country, it is finding difficult to manage itself. So even though we cannot say it has a better chance to lead the world, its also not impossible.
6314	India has a difficult time to manage itself first so there's no question of leading the world by this. However, if we compare between India and the western countries, let's have a look at the following points: 1. Nearly 90% of India is illiterate, so an illiterate country cannot lead the world. 2. India is more into castes, politics and religion and less into development. 3. The most important thing is that India does not have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself. If India goes on like this, then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "India will lead the world when it cannot lead itself!!"
6315	India has the potential to lead, because it has the second largest man power, and third largest army in the world. India is a country full of hopes and aspirations. And for Indians, nothing is impossible. We are proud to be Indians. And we will lead the world. In every manner. Even 34% scientists are from India.

6320	Being fatherless wouldn't ensure that the only heartaches you have are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A good father could come in and win your trust and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
6321	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you.

Some people would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence. I would rather he never exist than come in and out of my life.
6323	It would be nice to have a father who is there, but it isn't necessary. Just knowing he's there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
6324	It would be more fulfilling to be fatherless. Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
6325	i think that a father is a great example for a son. You have to be a dad, not just a dumm boy to be good at anything. A father will be a much better example than a bum.
6326	If a person does not have a father in life they won't learn about being caring, what gives a boy a father he is more likely to take him as a hero and a role model.
6327	Why would you feel like it would be better to have a fatherless life. Why can't you just embrace a lifes of your own? You can live a totally independent life, and still have a whole family around your shoulders. I think it would be better, at least in my point of view. My mother raised me and gave me everything I could ever want. I don't have an actual father but he is still like a father to me and we are still in contact. So I don't think it's true that a fatherless life is better. I think it would be better.
6328	Well, if you don't have a father, than you are going to learn from your mother. Your mother was a wonderful mother to raise me because I don't think my father would have ever taken care of me. I think my mother taught me a lot and showed me how to take care of myself. My mother is one of the best mothers in the world, and my sister is also a wonderful mother. My mother made sure to give me my footy shoes and my boots before I went out. My mother bought me clothes before I went to school. I am grateful for my mother's sacrifice. Without my mother, I would never have been able to survive as I am doing now. I would never have been able to do what I am doing now. My father never made any sacrifices for me, because he was always doing something else, like having sex with other women. He never paid any attention to me. I think I would have been a better parent if I had a father, because he would have taught me how to take care of myself and be an example to me for how to be a decent man. My father was really not there for me, just me mom and my sister.
6329	I'm not totally happy with my father, he is not so good to me but I think it shouldnt' matter if his mother raised him because he was raised by someone who taught him good values and good morals. Its good that he gave me these things because now i can give them to my child and my child can learn from it. I think that it's important to have a good mother. I don't have one and I don't know how i'd handle the situation and I think that if i didnt have a father I wouldn't be completely happy but i wouldn't have as much bad things to learn from as i would.
6330	To be fatherless is a great choice to make in my opinion. Trust me, I went through it some times, I wanted my poor father but at the same time I thought it would be bad to have a father that didn't care about me, then why should I care about him? If he wanted to be in my life, he could have been in my life. But being fatherless is not a bad thing because I have my mother and to me that is my father. I would rather have a father that wanna pay attention to me and actually be supportive to me.
6331	Being fatherless is not bad because I have my mother and to me that's my father. I would rather have a father who wants to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.
6332	My opinion is that as long as you have a happy, healthy relationship with your mother, that is fine, you don't need a father, but of course, knowing that we all have a father's love, wouldn't it be nice to have that love? My own father has been way too absent when I was a child and probably didn't care about me very much, but it is nice to know that I have my mother's love as well. Don't necessarily think you need a father right now though.
6333	I've gone through that. I wish I had a poor father but yet it isn't as bad as being fatherless. I saw my father for the last 18 years and now he's not in my life anymore. If he doesn't want to be in my life, why should I want to. If he wanted to be in my life he could've been in my life but being fatherless is not bad because I have my mother and to me that is my father. I would rather have a father who wants to be supportive of me.
6334	Being a Fatherless child doesn't make you evil. Also having your mother isn't great but you can still be happy even without one and you don't have to feel like you're special for not having a father. Having a mother is better than having a father. You don't always have to get what you want in life, and sometimes that's fine.
6335	Yes.If you research about FarQuhar. He didn't do anything to help Singapore, instead of doing anything he just made a big mess and allowed things like vice, crimes and gambling dens to carry on.
6336	Refusing to admit defeat or failure is not a good trait to have. It shows you lack confidence in your own judgement. The fact that he did something so disastrous after returning from a trip does not mean he was a bad ruler - it simply meant that he was trying to accomplish something.
6337	If you research about Farquhar he didn't do anything to help Singapore while Raffles was away, instead of doing nothing he made a mess and allowed things like vice,crimes and gambling dens carry on.
6338	It doesn't matter what Raffles did in his government except for letting vice,criminality and gambling facilities run rampant.
6339	Neither the illiterate Salvages or the voracious Farquiha have done anything to help Singapore. The real problem was caused by the ousting of the government officials. It brought about vice, crimes, and gambling dens in Singapore. It is to be noted that although they put their dignity on the line, we were still the same level as those common people.
6340	In the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. Now there are child pornographers and sexual predators online. Pornography opened the doors to new crimes.

6345	Even though human beings have sexual urges, they don't have to watch pornographic content to satisfy them. The one you love will probably have pornographic content that he or she is not happy about watching. Thus, you only have to watch it.
6346	Even though sexual desires exist, it doesn't mean people who are not your family or do not even know you should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires to the one you love.
6347	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean people you don't even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires to the one you love.

6350	Version of evolution. My apologies.
6351	Sorry about the change, since I do not think having support for creationist science should be a basis for questioning evolution.
6352	Oops, I meant to say evolutionist version of creation. My apologies.
6353	Explanation of what happened in Cambrian era.
6354	Creationist version of evolution
6355	we can prove to you that humans have not evolved from the beginning of recorded history.
6356	Humans have not evolved since recorded history.
6357	By studying the different species of primates and chimpanzees we have found no signs of human evolution.
6358	Yes, we can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history. In fact, our species has been thriving for millions of years
6359	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history. It is impossible for human beings to evolve to the point where they can develop
6360	Humans are evolutionary; the evolution of monkeys hasn't stopped. Fish have evolved into a variety of amazing creatures, including various types of stingrays and sea-horses with legs. The evolution of amphibians has stopped a long time ago. Birds didn't have all of the amazing feathers we do today until many, many millions of years ago.;
6361	As evolution started to happen, no one was looking. It happened billions of years ago and nobody noticed. Eventually when humans became intelligent and saw that their evolvement was happening slowly, evolution did not stop. Why can't we find pseudo-hybrid fish with legs forming because the natural environment was not suitable and only animals that did not have legs were able to survive.
6362	This is an interesting issue. I think that evolution stopped thousands of years ago because there is no evidence of it happening now.
6363	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? I mean, if it happened billions of years ago, than how come it's not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
6364	Why are we still evolving? Because billions of years ago, monkeys with arms, fish with legs, and all these bizarre kinds of hybrids developed. Why aren't we evolving now? Because if they evolved billions of years ago, then why didn't they evolve millions of years ago? Why can't we find pseudo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What stopped evolution?
6365	Most importantly, for me as a teacher, I went to school and I am 14 years old and I am not great at math... :

6370	People are sitting on their asses all day playing video games when they need their own physical exercise. So fatties go outside and play football or something and people who aren't fat stop playing video games and go and get their energy back. These are my words, "Peace out assholes"

6375	I think we should have gym because kids get fat and tubby. It's not okay for kids to get fat and tubby.
6376	When kids are too thin and slim or rather don't have the usual body, they will definitely get unwanted attention by other kids at school. What parents should do is to get them a gym to fit in. Yes! However, I think we should do a little control on gym
6377	Anorexia is a health problem in the modern society. One of the reasons is for young people today do not experience the pressures of sports and physical activity. The bad economic situation can be the reason why children do not go to school regularly. In my opinion, there should be

6415	It may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
6416	The 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University, may be due to the easy access to porn.
6417	Easy access to porn may be the reason there has been a decline in rapes over the last 25 years.
6418	The increase of pornography may be the reason why there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years.
6419	Access to porn may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
6420	It isn't pornography that needs to change, it's the acceptance of it in society.
6421	If Pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by the society, then no argument could be made that pornography was degrading anyone. Therefore, if the society is to abhor movie actors for example, then the act of being an actor becomes degrading. The act of producing pornography doesn't need to change, but the acceptance by society.
6422	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example) the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
6423	If pornography and the people who produce it were respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. The same goes for being an actor - if we knew that acting was a profession that deserved our respect, then no argument could be made that the act of being an actor was degrading.
6424	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that pornography was degrading anyone. Likewise, if, as a society, we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
6425	Some people say God is against porn but we won't know because the Bible does not mention porn because it didn't exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
6426	Don't believe anything you hear in TV or newspapers. People lie for money.
6427	Some people say God is against porn. However, it is not clear how he knows about pornography because the Bible did not mention pornography. Therefore, how can we know that it is a sin?
6428	Let's be honest here. Even the bible says it is a sin but in the times the bible was written, pornography did not exist. So how do we know it is a sin?
6429	Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible did not mention porn. So how do we know it is a sin?
6430	It is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
6431	The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
6432	It would be better if people took care of their community first before they thought about themselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
6433	Advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
6434	helping others is better than thinking only about ourselves because if we all helped out our community there would be no dangerous places in our world. So, if we are preparing for war and the shooting starts on land, water, and air then we have to let the president know that they should shut the borders to Americans who think they are superior to other people because they hate other people. If the Dems win they should stop helping other countries because it makes them feel good but they do not want to do it. So we have to become better than this type of people and act like they are indifferent to them.
6435	Two people working together for the common good are better than one person working on his own. For example, football is a team sport where each player has to believe in the team and not himself. There is no "I", there is only "we". For example, last night in the Super Bowl, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes without the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6436	Advanced the common good is better than each person do his/her own way because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport, so we all have to believe in each other and not in our selves because there is no "I in team", for example, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass, so we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6437	Football is a team sport. There is no "I in team". Like the last night in Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive without the lineman blocking for the quarterback. The quarterback believed in the lineman to block the run. The receiver believes in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6438	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, Football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6439	 Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor. For example, in football as a team sport, they all have to believe in each other and not in themselves because there is no "I in Team". For example, last year in the Super Bowl the Steelers could not score a winning drive in the last 2 minutes because there was not enough "I in the group." The Steelers did not have the linemen believing in the quarterback to get the quarterback to the receiver to make a pass, so they couldn't score the winning drive in the last two minutes, and the receiver couldn't score the winning drive in the last two minutes because the linemen didn't believe in the quarterback to get the quarterback to the receiver, so the linemen didn't believe in the receiver to get the receiver to the quarterback to score the winning drive in the last two minutes. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
6440	In regard to the What goes around comes around, because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them, but something good will come back to you helping you better yourself.
6441	We should be giving first aid to others rather than trying to please ourselves. When you do things for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
6442	When people think about advancing the common goods, personal pursuit is less important because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. So when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
6443	As a society it must be empowered the individual so that everyone can be respected. We've got to stop lookin' out for ourselves and look out for the common good. If you don't help others before you help yourself, it won't do much good for you, but good will come back to you helping you better yourself. This is my view of the world and we need to be able to implement things that prevent individuals from getting into tighter worlds of corruption and selfishness instead of mutually beneficial advancement in the democratic process. It's a much better plan for people to look out for each other rather than their own life.
6444	Most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before looking out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
6445	There should be no argument to this... but the idea of dishing out uniforms based on kids looks or convenience is... confusing. A little weird. Like, yes in some cases that can be used as a tool for students that would rather try to avoid being teased or for kids who, ah, don't like their taste of fashion. How about exceptions?
6446	Hearing people not agree with each other makes everyone equally important. If some children can wear what they want, some children may teased and feel less equal to their peers around them. Uniforms allow a child to feel less worried about their appearance, which is why most schools with the option of a uniform feel less time.
6447	Uniforms in school increase equality. Even with short changing out a trouser or shirt it takes less than 10 min which equates to a lot of wasted time. If children can dress how they want, they are less likely to be teased and may feel more equal to their peers around them.
6448	If all children are treated equally no matter what they wear or where they go to school, some children might tease and feel less equal to their peers around them.
6449	Nowadays, children can wear whatever they want, some kids might get teased for wearing clothes that others in the school have, and the less equality the kids feel.
6450	it is good idea...children should be equal, and don't compare clothes of each other... if they see something new from their classmates, they want to buy it, even it is not necessary.
6451	Children should be given the chance to see and to buy what they want if it is not necessary because nobody knows what is going to happen in the future.
6452	Children should be equal, and do not compare clothes of each other. If they see something new from their classmates they want to buy it, even it is not necessary.
6453	It is a good idea to not compare the clothes of each other because it won't make them feel more happy with themselves and it won't ruin their inner self-worth.
6454	It is good to let the children be able to choose what to buy. Kids should not be forced to buy certain clothes, because each person should be able to wear what they like.
6455	We know the English language uses social words like khaki or slacks that are metaphorical...so any item that is socially awkward will be changed to a less awkward word... That a girl would wear kurta will be changed to a short skirt...or is she taller than her husband...if
6456	Means you don't have to worry about what you have to wear! Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mujis.
6457	Means if you have nothing to wear, you can simply wear school uniform and you don't have to worry about what to wear. Instead, people say wear uniform and you have to worry about what to wear.
6458	If someone told you that you shouldn't be worrying about what you are wearing or what kind of look you will make to others, it means that you don't have to. Less awkward when people say, wear a uniform or school uniform, and you wear a Palestinian-like wear.
6459	Don't have to worry about what to wear. Less awkward when people say wear school uniform and you wear mufti...
6460	Uniforms don't have to look nice, and people don't have to spend forever figuring out what they are going to wear and there is less drama, since everyone is wearing the same thing.
6461	Uniforms make you wear the same thing and it looks more beautiful because everyone wears the same clothes. Also, less drama and less stress, everyones wearing the same thing.
6462	With uniforms there will be less of "Oh you don't wear this and you wear that." Then everyone is wearing the same thing and 1. it looks nicer 2. You don't have to spend forever trying to figure out what you are going to wear and 3. less drama, everyone's wearing the same thing.
6463	With uniforms there will be less drama because everyone is wearing the same thing and because it looks nicer. Also less of oh you don't wear this and you wear that.
6464	With uniforms, there won't be less of oh you don't wear this, and you wear that. Then everyone is wearing the same thing, and 1. it looks better, 2. You don't have to spend forever trying to figure out what you're going to wear and 3. less drama, everyone's wearing the same thing.
6465	Being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood because growing up without a father would mean you can't prove to your father that there is greatness in him. meaning the son he made turns out to be a bright and better person in society.
6466	It is better to have a fatherless childhood. Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a father would mean you cannot prove to your father there is greatness in him. Meaning your son turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
6467	That is why I believe that it is better to have a lously father instead of no father. It will bring so much joy and happiness to your childhood. He will always be your angel. He will always be your help in times of need, and he will support you. He will always be your protector. That's why I believe that it is better to have a father than no father. I hope you will decide to have a father because it will make you so happier. It will also teach you to be a great human being. I hope you will decide to have a father because it would mean so much to him. It would mean everything to him. That is why I hope you will decide to have a father. That is why I believe that it is better to have a father because it will give you a great memory of growing up with a father who loved you. When I was growing up,
6468	I believe that it's better to have a lousy father than no father because growing up without a father would have a major impact on your childhood. Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a father would mean you can't prove to your father that there is greatness in him. Meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.
6469	True, a fatherless child would have a major impact on his life because he would not know who his father was or what he was lousy at or good at and there would be no proof that there was greatness in his father. As a consequence the son he made turns out to be a bright and better person in society.

6501	Blowing plastic bottles to small pieces to make them reusable is no the most wasteful thing to do. PET is easy to recycle and pays to help the economy come out of recession. Maybe not in a large way but every bit helps. It contributes to making less trash! There are numerous reasons why plastic bottles are more expensive than glass containers, and the environmental gains are far larger than the cost. According to the International Food & Agricultural Organization, water bottles made of crystal glass costs the same, or even less, and the process to make a glass bottle is much more energy and environmentally damaging than is the process to make a plastic bottle.
6502	Studies show that bottled water is more expensive than tap water and offers little to no nutritional value. But at the same time, bottled water is recycled and pollution is almost absent.
6503	More than a million people in the United States purchase bottled water every day, which is helping the economy. It doesn't really make sense to be banning bottled water because of some ecological issues because 1 minute bottle does not make enough impact to damage the environment. Bottled water can be recycled. The NACE, National Association for PET Container Resources, reports that the United States is the world leader in recycling PET bottles because of plastic resale. See a list of contributing factors about the recycle level of plastic bottles at http://www.natpet.net/
6504	It’s not a large amount but every little bit helps. Banning plastic water bottles would be a huge mistake in this very moment because more people purchase bottled water every day than can be recycled on the curb side. Also, according to the National Association for PET Container Recycling Resources (200BEE.pdf) it is the most recycled container by weight and number! Also, could be that they are making way too many bottles at a time and not bringing them through curb side. So maybe they could do something about making better bottles that could be recycled easily. I think I wrote this well but I know this is really a controversial topic so maybe my opinion doesnt reflect everybody’s. I just wanted to put it out there for discussion.

6547	Science has proven it. This could have been true in the past, but now that scientists have discovered that there is no God. This is a good thing.
6548	There is no god. Science has proven that. There was a time when people used myth to explain things but science has proven those myths are useless.
6549	Science has proven that there is no god. It was just an excuse made up so people from simpler times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
6550	In the name of atheism, no one has ever waged a war. If you don't like it, worship something else.
6551	No one has ever waged a war for atheism.
6552	Unlike Hitler who was Jewish, Mao, Chou, Dongying, and Comrade Stalin were atheists. Nor was the Soviet Union atheistic;
6553	So far, no one has ever brought religion into war and that's in a land with more than 2 billion people.
6554	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism.
6555	Parental spanking as a disciplining method should be used whenever it is painful enough for children to learn to avoid the wrong things.
6556	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children. The spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6557	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6558	Using spanking as a form of discipline that is painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things I strongly agree with my opinion.
6559	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as a means of discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
6560	Yes, they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something wrong, they will get hit.
6561	Yes. Because if they do something bad, they will get hit.
6562	Yes, because they need to learn that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
6563	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
6564	Yes, because they need to learn a way to remember if they do something bad. They will get hit.
6565	Abuse is never good, if it didn't do good, wouldn't be against the law.
6566	Abuse is never good.
6567	Spanking is a form of abuse and violence that is never good. Parents and children must have enough knowledge to understand if spanking is really necessary.
6568	Abuse is never good, in the circumstances described, yes.
6569	Overwhelmingly, I have experienced a spanking coming from my dad and have had it impact me in negative ways. However, I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
6570	An atheistic ideology promotes better morals and ethics. What does Christianity contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human, must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
6571	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe in something is to accept it as the truth. Atheism denies the existence of that truth, and thus believes that no one, no group of people or any religion should follow the path Christ or any philosopher promised, and that other ideologies, beliefs, ways, people or religions are more valid than any that came before. We must let people prove the merit of their beliefs, ways, or ideologies, and see what their beliefs or ways can bring to the community as a whole. Better morals? Sure they can, and people have become better as a result. But what is morality?] But atheism denies the
6572	Christianity believes that by following the teachings of Christ, one can promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism promote? Nothing. To believe that one must follow the ways of God, is tantamount to not being able to do so. In Christ he is a better example to follow than most believers. The more ideology a human leaves off, the less effective it becomes.
6573	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? The belief that no one has to follow the path of Christ. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For an ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall short of it.
6574	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. The atheist, on the other hand, is not well known for such tenets. Instead of presenting a better example, by living by their principles, atheists are the ones that give those that follow a bad example.
6575	I don't believe in Christianity nor Atheism. I'm a Muslim, that's the best religion.
6576	There's nothing good about Islam. There's only punishment and persecution.
6577	Islam is the best religion that does not believe in Christianity and Ateism.
6578	I'm a Muslim, that's the best religion.
6579	I don't believe in Christianity nor in atheism. I am a Muslim, that's the best religion.
6580	Internet full of atheists who are intolerant of other peoples beliefs and won't leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose. Those who choose to be atheists are biggots. Plain and simple.
6581	The debate that the internet is full of conceded stuck up, narcissistic atheists, who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other peoples beliefs and cannot leave people alone to worship or not worship as they chose is very correct. Atheist are biggots, plain and simple.
6582	Internet is a deeply bigoted and intolerant place because it is full of concedeed, stuck up, nasty, atheists who are fanatic and intolerant of other people being happy in their beliefs and won't let people worship as they choose. Atheists are bigots plain and simple
6583	Having the religion debate prove nothing. The internet is full of recognized, stanged-up, and narcissistic atheists. They are totally prejudiced and intolerant of other people beliefs and can't leave people alone to worship or not worship as they please. Atheists are bigoted and ignorant. They are all about censorship. The point about the debate here is to seek a common sense solution to a problem that the atheist are mad about.
6584	All this debate proves is that the internet is full of conceded, stuck up, narcissistic, atheists who are totally bigoted and intolerant of other peoples beliefs and can't leave people alone to worship or not worship as they choose atheists are biggots plain and simple
6585	To me, science proves that God exists in a way. Its only a question of which, but the meaning of everything is related to spirituality.
6586	Science has proven the existence of God, it's only a question of which one at this point.
6587	The possibility of a worldly god does not have any contradiction or contradiction within science.
6588	Science at this point has attested to the existence of God, but a question remains whether it's the only one or whether there are more than one.
6589	Science attests to the existence of God or God is the Creator of the Universe and within it's vastness we see God. Science is proof of God.
6590	There are bigger congregations of atheists in this forum, it's not just Christian, it's secular as well. Look around.
6591	Of course, it is my duty to be a Christian when there is no other choice. However, the membership of the atheist is a lot bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
6592	Christianity because I always root for the underdog. The membership of the atheist here is way bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
6593	There's just not that many of us to really support either group. Look at the congregations of both.
6594	In point of view, Christianity, because I always root for the underdog. The membership of the atheist is way bigger. Just look at the congregations of both.
6595	Christianity does offer hope in the world. Christianity does tell others to help the poor.
6596	Christianity does offer hope in the world and you should help the poor.
6597	Christianity does offer hope to the world. Christianity does tell others to help the poor.
6598	Christianity tells people to help others in the world.
6599	Christianity does offer hope in the world but at times they may offer up their money instead of their prayers. Christianity does tell others to help the poor, but at times it may
6600	God helps those who help themselves. So I'll go and help myself to school laptops and then God will help me?
6601	God helps those who help themselves. So I will go and help myself to get a school laptop then God will help me?
6602	 God helps those who help themselves! So I will help myself to schools laptops and then God will help me?
6603	God helps those who help themselves. So why don't you go to the library and get some information then God will help you?
6604	God help those who help themselves. So, if I will go and help myself to school laptops then God will help me.
6605	Spanking shouldn't be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
6606	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
6607	Spanking should never be the solution. Never spank the child to the point of beating. Yes, I agree that you can gently spank the child to a point where it cannot hurt anymore, but never to the point where you beat the child.
6608	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the last option. Yes I agree that if it gets to a point where you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.
6609	The key in any discipline is to discipline as a last resort, so spanking should never be the final resort. Yes, I agree if it gets to a certain point, you can lightly spank the kid but not to the point where you're beating the kid.
6610	Parents needs to teach the child from what is wrong and from what is right.
6611	When the child is young they don't know what's right and what's wrong. The parent should teach the child from what's wrong and from what's right.
6612	Because if the child is young, they don't know what is right or wrong, the parent needs to teach them from what is right or wrong.
6613	Because if the child is young, they don't know what's wrong and what's right. The parents need to teach the child from what's wrong and what's right.
6614	Because if the child is young they don't know what's wrong and what's right the parent needs to teach the child from what's wrong and from what's right
6615	Parents could just scold their children just so they wouldn't stop what they're doing wrong. I agree, hitting is not the best option to discipline a child. Also, it hurts a child physically and emotionally. Kids would not learn the value of respect for their parents, because they would only learn how to be scared. They wouldn't do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they're just scared their parents would hit them.
6616	This should not be punish, but i think i understand it as education. Because sometimes it is necessary to punish child even in the wrong way just like an adult does. Parents don't only believe in good education, but they also believe in discipline.
6617	Taking a baseball bat and beating up a child is not a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldn't learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wouldn't do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them.
6618	Interpreting my rights as my freedom to kiss and hug other people to my full glory. In certain situations where obscene language or touching is supposedly allowed, I think violence is all the use of it
6619	No. parents could just scold their child until the child stops what they are doing wrong and hurting children emotionally and physically. Hitting is not really a solution because it hurts the child and teaches them that it's ok to hit and punish the other kids or adults. Kids wouldnt learn how to respect their parents because they would learn only how to be scared. They wouldnt do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them
6620	There are different punishment you could give your child.
6621	You should give your child different kinds of punishment.
6622	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child. In my opinion the punishment is in going on a ten day probation period of not
6623	There are different punishments you could give your child. They are not only hit.
6624	It should be clear that no child should get hit. There are different punishments for different children depending on what kind of child it is.
6625	If I found out that my wife had killed someone I would not be too angry to turn her in, but I would not feel the same sadness for her. Also, I would leave her for any woman who loved me and was not a murderer. I love a person that is honest, sincere, and that loves me. You cannot love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. So I wouldn't fall in love with her if she was a murderer, and I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me if I found out that she had committed murder. I wouldn't want to live with a murderer, but I wouldn't want
6626	While I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me, if I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You cannot love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
6627	If you love someone but they do not behave like they have died you can't really love them. And I wouldn't get involved with a murderer.
6628	If my spouse committed murder, I would turn him in. If my wife had killed someone, I would be gone. You can't love a person who commits murder. You would not fall in love with a murderer.
6629	If I found out that my wife murdered someone I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. You can't love a person who is not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
6630	The line is drawn when it comes to murder. Yes, at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about the reasons why someone would be driven to kill. I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that I would turn my wife in if she ever killed someone.
6631	Either the murderer be caught and punished, or I would turn my wife in if she killed someone. In saying that, I would turn my wife in if she ever murdered someone.
6632	I agree with the call to prosecute convicted killers. In speaking to the issue of "snitching" when it comes to homicides, I am all for it. At first, I probably would not do anything about it. Then I think about the few reasons why someone would be driven to commit the crime and I don't think the act should be committed. In speaking to the motivation for some homicides, however, I would certainly turn my wife in if she ever killed someone.
6633	I would definitely turn in my wife if she ever killed anybody. In saying that I would turn in a murderer if I ever saw him lying in my bed looking at the TV thinking about me.
6634	When someone is driven to kill by mental illness, that act should not be committed. In saying that, I would turn my wife in if she ever committed this act.
6635	If you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. I am a pro life advocate and I do believe abortion should be illegal.
6636	Being pro-choice means being for the life of the mother. The mother has the right to decide whether to have an abortion or not. An abortion is the final solution. Human abortion would be under no circumstances acceptable.
6637	Having some choices are good, but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. I think you should have some choice, but it should not be the government that controls your life. I like the choice that you can have. It is not the government's job to control.
6638	Protect life is always good. But, if you are the one in charge of all the decisions you are in total chaos. Life always should be protected.
6639	Having choices is good but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. I am for life. I do believe abortions should be illegal.
6640	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away from the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours.
6641	No one has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, then "that" is no longer your body, since it feels outside your own.
6642	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if something that you are trying to get rid of feels off at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then it is no longer yours, because it feels outside your own.
6643	Everywhere on the planet, a substantial portion of the human population is bound by strict social norms that prohibit engaging in sexual intercourse before an individual becomes an adult. There is no higher moral standard: one inflicts profound physical pain upon an innocent and honest mind for no discernible benefit. Furthermore, the approach is evidently completely unnecessary: women mature in a normal pace and hormonal levels that neither accelerate nor slow down. The possible exception to this, of course, is virgins who were born that way.
6644	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own.
6645	Gays should be allowed to have the same rights as other people such as the right to marry.
6646	Gays are human beings just like we are. They should have the right to marriage just like we do.
6647	Gays are human beings just like we are. They should have the right to marry just like we do.
6648	There is no evidence that gay people are less powerful than other human beings. There is no evidence that they are immune to the same illnesses or have less geniuses or are less spiritual. Therefore, gay people should have
6649	Gays are not human beings, just like they aren't us. They should not have the right to marriage just like us.
6650	Definitely, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! I reckon there would be less control over the masses, which is a good thing. And there would simply be calm and not so calm areas of the world. There'd be little communes, and then gang rivaled cities. But at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.
6651	Definitely, the egg and spoon race is a wicked idea! And maybe we should have the royal family breed up a few more unbelievably uinterbred little kids to partake in the warfare. Imagine them up against the vodka drinking Russians. You probably wouldn't have to deal with the warfare if your country wasn't so rich with weapons, but at least all the fighting nobheads would kill themselves in one place, and the sophisticated calm people wouldn't have to pay for it.

6655	Do you even know the meaning of charitable?
6656	You certainly are offering some sort of moral high ground or ethical issues for your donation and compensation. If you donate your old clothes and do not give them to the homeless people, who then will receive them and put some money away? Or do you really think that you would buy them back from the homeless? However, it does not matter. All that matters is that you are being a good person for the cause of charity and donating the clothes that you no longer want. But in fact, you should sell them to the homeless street people, because they are earning money in the first place. So do something nice for charity that won't be costing you a dime to help people who desperately need your help.
6657	It isn't at all acceptable of you to donate your old clothes that you no longer want and then expect to get a tax write-off in return. The money would be better spent on charity. Even though people can be selfish in one way or another, do you honestly think this is a perfectly acceptable reason to give stuff away for free? Do you think it's a brilliant idea? Are you a genius who can think beyond your four wits? Are you the next Mozart or Einstein or...?
6658	How can you be charitable to donate your unwanted clothes and then expect to get financial compensation. Do you even know the meaning of charitable? The act of charity can be motivated by many reasons; some people donate to receive a tax deduction or because they feel like they are making the world a better place. P.S. Why don't you sell the clothes to some homeless'street' people? They have money from begging and can probably skip a meal or two to buy some clothes.
6659	Being charitable doesn't need to take the form of financial compensation. Just simply donating clothes that you don't need anymore to people that don't have them is just as charitable.
6660	this is a good idea if we consider moving to universal suffrage.  this way no matter the heritage one is born with, a girl could become a president even if that heritage would not qualify one as a citizen.
6661	Let's change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years but change the natural born citizen part. Instead of being natural born citizen make it be United States citizen for 40 years. This way people whose parents move here when they are kids would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here. I think this would be a good topic to talk about and could easely elaberate on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
6662	I think that it should be on a list in the constitution, even though it was original written on a day different than today, or before, it is still appropriate and relevant in today’s society.
6663	Like a good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution, an idea could be to change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years, but change the natural born citizen part.  instead of being a natural born citizen, make it be a US citizen for 40 years.  this way people whose parents move here when they are kids, these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here.  I think this would be a grand topic to discuss in your paper and easely explain on examples.  remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
6664	You should be aware that your proposal would be a historic change to the constitution and would affect a lot of people. However, a good proposal for an amendment would be to change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the United States for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part.  instead of being a natural-born citizen, make it be a United States citizen for 40 years.  this way people whose parents move here when they are kids; these would be the only ways that they know and know as much as any other kid here.  i think this would be a grand topic to talk about in your paper and could easly elaberate on with examples.  remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
6665	They are treated differently because attempted murder and an officer involved shooting are completely different things.   If a citizen commits attempted murder, he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Even if he did commit attempted murder, he cannot get bail and people get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that.   If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed.  It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated. Remember, innocent until proven guilty.
6666	They are treated differently because attempted murder and officer-involved shooting are completely different cases. If a citizen, as you put it, commits attempted murder, he goes to jail when the investigation has been completed and probable cause has been found. Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I don't really know where you are going with that. If an officer gets in a shooting on duty, he was probably faced with a direct threat to his life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts are investigated, remember, innocent until proven guilty.
6667	If a citizen commits attempted murder, he goes to jail when the investigation is complete and probable cause has been found. Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. The police also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not sure where you are going with your statement. If an officer involved shooting on-duty is justified, the shooting will be investigated and made sure all laws and policies were followed. It seems you want to convict the police before all of the facts have been investigated. Remember, innocent until proven guilty.
6668	Officers are treated differently because the offending of a citizen can only be proven after investigations have been conducted and evidence has been presented. If it is found that an officer is guilty of a crime on-duty and other laws have been violated, the officer will be charged and possibly charged with weapons carrying when justified and the finger will point to the officer. An officer will also be investigated for any other illegal acts and will be charged with any crime related to the shooting.
6669	Furthermore, things are treated very differently when you are charged with attempted murder. If a person is charged with attempted murder, he is either innocent until proven guilty or goes to jail in a sting operation. People also get bail for murder charges, so I do not understand where you are going with that. When an officer fires and kills, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed. Also, the officer will likely be fired.
6670	Most people are required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor.  This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money, instead of letting it sit in your bank account.  If this is a court sanctioned inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor.  Aside from the investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about.  You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.  Don't go overboard, and spend all the money at one time, mind you.  Spend well, and leverage your money the best you can.

Don't go overboard, and spend all the money at one time, mind you.  Spend well, and leverage your money the best you can.
6672	The idea of professional advisors is a good one but how would you go about finding a financial advisor that is able to do the job you are looking for without knowing anyone? How would you go about knowing if the advisor has any faults? How would you be able to prove the adviser hasn't been cheating?
6673	If the inheritance is court required money then the court will most likely require the help of a financial advisor.  Aside from investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them.  There really isn't anything else that can be done.  You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more that you can do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.

6674	Every person is required to enlist the aid of a financial advisor. This is a good thing as it allows you to invest the money instead of letting it sit in your bank account.  If this is court ordered inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor.  Aside from the investing, what the person wants to do with the money is up to them.

Don't go overboard, and spend all the money at one time, mind you.  Spend well, and leverage your money the best you can.

Lots of things you can do with it. I hope you find what you're looking for.

6680	If he doesn't already have a competent attorney, you need to hire one immediately. These types of cases can be especially complicated, as there is more at stake than you may realize.  For instance, a conviction on a drug charge may mean reduce or little eligibility for federal student aid in college, (if he decides to go that route).  Although it IS against the law to give anyone a drug that is not prescribed for  him, there is always grounds to review this with the prosecuting authority. I urge you to contact a skilled criminal defense attorney in your area.  Be prepared to pay a sizeable retainer.  For a referral to a criminal defense attorney, contact your local or state bar association.

6685	Is this a traffic ticket? What does it say on the ticket? If it says that there is a mandatory court appearance, then you need to go to court. I wouldn't listen to the cop unless it's printed on the ticket that you need to appear. It is important that you follow the printed instructions period.  Or just ask your husband. He probably knows the city's counsel and can get you out of this whole thing.

6690	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized.  Let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws.  Same thing with drugs - decriminalization or outright legalization would allow governments to raise revenues that could be spent on treatments and public health action, and would take away a source of more violent criminal activity that supports these illegal trades.  There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.

6694	Yes, prostitution should absolutely be legalized; let local governments decide if they want it or not and handle it either through ordinances or zoning laws. You should also allow local governments to outlaw drugs and alcohol because it is their money.  Also, think about the effects of prohibition; how did it come about? Was it to do with the lawsuits that ultimately funded the first war on drugs?  Did anyone realize that drugs could be such a terrible thing to put illegal individuals in jail?  Yes, lawmakers have to follow the wishes of their constituents when they decide to get rid of certain crimes, but not when they decide not to. {There's no reason these things should be illegal, and every reason they should be legalized.
6695	He is carrying out his own agenda.
6696	He should always be fighting a good case since it's not only a good case that they can reasonably expect to win on but also that the recovery involved will be sufficient to justify the time and expense involved in taking it on.  He can't do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved. What more are you expecting him to tell you? He will either agree to represent you or decline based upon the others opinion weighed against his risk factors.  And even if he declines to represent you, it doesn't necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general.  It just means that it isn't worth it to him.  If he feels you have no case period, he will tell you that also.
6697	When other lawyers are applying to represent your case, you will be offered an offer of representation.  He should make sure that he is willing to take on the case for the right price as well as the right reasons. He will negotiate with you because he wants to make sure that the case will be successful and the circumstances are suitable for doing so.
6698	Just think about this carefully.  He is trying to resolve your cases before they get any worse.  If you do a criminal case, the insurance companies will never have to pay you anything, and you don't have to take a risk either.  But if you get into another problem and your current case, and you blow it with the insurance companies, the cost to you will be more than it is to the insurance companies.  When you put it that way, you may see that it is worth it for you to take this case on and then follow up with another contingency litigation case if it does get tough. If it's only going to cost you a hundred dollars, it doesn't matter, but then after the last hundred dollars of lawsuit it costs you a thousand dollars of your pay check.  So that's actually different if you don't take the case on you and then spend the last thousand dollars, but taking on the case and defending yourself and going to court is a lot more expensive to you.
6699	He should be doing exactly as he should... These cases can cost a firm a fortune to pursue and he needs to make sure that taking this case on is a good financial decision, meaning that not only is it a good case that they can reasonably expect to win on but also that the recovery involved will be sufficient to justify the time and expense involved in taking it on. He can't do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved. What more are you expecting him to tell you?

6700	Watch any news on any channel, the whole news cycle consists of something being reported and someone else getting the credit of it.  So don't believe what you read in the papers if it says one person hit another one. Also, under oath, the person who blows you away and your believing the words would be being punished for perjury and clearly you would not want that to happen.  They would not be set free until those things are proven, they're being seen as false witnesses of something they did not witness!
6701	If that someone was under oath and was giving himself in, and they were still a member of the bench then they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served. It would be a time-consuming process, but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.  Anyone who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.  Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God. So God if your listening, Help Them!!! The same exact reasoning goes for lying under oath and even if there is no person under oath it seems pretty clear that a person is not entitled to a trial if they refuse to answer their lawyer's question and would thereby be denied a fair trial.
6702	Well, if that person was under oath and was "giving himself in" and really was a violent, cold-blooded murderer (i.e., sincerely admitted they killed the person, after they were  already dead, and they were acting on behalf of the US government by harming the innocent citizen) then they would certainly accommodate the person!  Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.  Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.  Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God.  So God if your listening, Help Them!!!
6703	Well, if this someone was under oath and saying that they were "giving themselves in" I guarantee the Court would have to hear what this person said.  Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, the Bailiff would certainly take them into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if this person was under oath and admitted to doing a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold this person and begin processing the paperwork.

6705	Income taxes are our only form of funding for all government programs. We overpay each year, and in the spring, receive a partial refund. That's always nice to help cover credit card purchases or home improvement. But many Americans end up having to pay in more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. OUCH!
6706	What!? And all this time I've been paying into taxes all. The fact is that many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. OUCH!
6707	That is usually the case. Most people who end up filing tax returns have the right to an amount of tax deduction to help them out and stop them from paying that last little bit of tax they do owe.
6708	We over pay each year and in the spring get a partial refund, this is always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. But many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. OUCH!
6709	Income taxes are a great way to tax people. However, they are not very efficient in the way that they handle large tax payments. So, if you and your employer don't get an income tax return due to an absence of earnings, you may have to pay a percentage of your earnings in extra taxes.
6710	If there are no minors, the language which you use should be attractive to the readers and not distract. There is a psychology which works in the minds of such people who keep the attitude, I don't care. They think that you can't catch them. They don't even care to see your reaction. They don't wait for one. They know well that their answer will never be chosen as the best, so why care? Just vomit and earn few points. Besides, it takes some brains to answer a question which they don't have. Most of them feel pleasure and become sadistic in their approach. Come on....'freedom of speech' is also an abusive term. The ethics, values, etc are contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. You have got plenty of choices to choose words and its a pity if one can't find them and starts using fowl language.

6715	It is legal to push your religion on those that don't believe in it, because you are writing about morality. In the case of Islam school should not teach anything about it at all, because you are holding up religion as morals. If religion was teaching morals and not just a religion, but a societal model then yes, it would be right in the school. It wouldn't matter if it was to the right or left, etc, or if it is a traditional religion that is just about god, or a modern religion.
6716	Is it legal to push your religeon on those that do not believe in it?!?!?! I think that answers your question. Better yet - if it was Islam they were pushing in school, would you want your child present??? Not only is it moral to remove religion from schools, it should be mandatory. Children are in school to LEARN, not to pray, not to learn about God. God can't get you a job or pay your bills. If you insist on God being present in schools, send your children to the seminary for an education.
6717	Is it legal to push your religious ideology on those who do not believe in it? I think that answers your question.

6720	Class B misdemeanor definitely does not carry serious consequences. I'm sure you know it. You may not be aware that in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, in certain situations a charge of "wrongful imprisonment" can carry the consequence of a probation sentence. Because of our rule of evidence, I do not know how common it is in Massachusetts, but where it is used it is very likely that there is a constitutional right to a jury trial that has the potential of overturning a conviction.
6721	In my opinion, falsely imprisoning someone is something that happens more than you think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. And in my opinion, they do not have those laws because they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent and "falsely imprison" them. The southern states are real good at that! As long as there is no discovery, then the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent. And yes, they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help further their careers down the road and the part that kills me is that not only are these low lifes still able to sleep, but, the Law lets them get away with it and when it is (years later, usually), discovered there is nothing the innocent person can do to get back the freedom that was taken from him.
6722	The way you are described, I could judge you as guilty of falsely imprisoning me, especially in states that don't have discovery laws.
6723	It's like this: There is a specific procedure that can be done when the prosecutor in any criminal case knows the evidence is fake or lies. It is called Discovery and it is an legal document that a Prosecutor from another jurisdiction sent to a relevant State Attorney. If the Prosecutor has prepared the evidence without considering or allowing the prosecutor to question the witnesses or getting the evidence properly cross checked, then it could be illegal to convict. But before anyone says that. Let's be clear, we are saying an innocent person is wrongfully and illegally convicted in Texas. The modern day case is a classic attorney unable to provide proper defense to a Federal Constitutional Crimes case that came to light many years later. Putting in simple steps a court can do to have an innocent person released from a Federal crime conviction. You want to give credit where credit is due, the USFCCR was at the helm of this incredible victory. UFO Crisis Investigators organized and litigated at a later time, the case with one goal in mind: free the innocent. The government who believed it was involved in this case to the fullest, botched the case from start to finish as they overrode the judge order. The government still intends to try to overturn this case right on the high water mark of the GITMO AGI and put charges on a 3rd party all in order to block the release of the truth to the public. Considering this case I fear that there will be a lot more cases like this in the future, but I've already been treating one with the latest technologies and I am hopeful that the Government will have to do something about their methods and procedures which degrade the honor of their victims and their families. If I'm correct, and the Obama witch-hunt, coming
6724	Well strike the 3rd answer down. False imprisonment is something that happens more than you think, especially in states that do not have discovery laws. And in my opinion, they do not have those laws because they want to be able to railroad the poor and innocent. The Southern states are real good about that. As long as there is no discovery, then the prosecution can hide facts that downright prove the charged person is innocent. And yes, they knowingly do this just to embellish their conviction record to help further their careers down the road.

6725	Your attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments, etc.. If he doesn't own a paid home or other material goods the attorney probably won't bother. He may look at your personal auto insurance. That will usually cover for uninsured motorists if you carry that coverage but he would have to determine of you could use it since you weren't driving at the time. Since you say you have $170000 in medical bills I am guessing you don't have any personal medical insurance either. Your attorney should be able to tell you what to expect to receive after his fee, which is usually 25% to 40% depending.
6726	There are laws against discrimination in schools, work places, and public housing. The laws are enforced. Your odds are not good of getting past his limits.

6727	 Your chances are not good to get past his limits. Your lawyer might sue him but he is doubtful you would be able to collect much if you won the case.

6728	Your odds are not good to be able to go further in the case that he cannot be stopped, since you say he is not caring for other life forms in the area, but your attorney might sue him and with his insurance he might be able to collect money. Even if he win a case he would have to go after him for garnishments and the funds would probably not go to cover the medical expenses you have incurred. The worst he could do is give you a bunch of advice which is usually useless as you already know what to do, and if he does go to jail it probably won't be very long since he is probably just cleaning houses for a living. However, if he were to go to jail it probably wouldn't mean he would have to pay you anything since it would probably be short time, and the matter would probably be settled outside the courts.
6729	Your odds are not good getting beyond his limits. The attorney might sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much.

6730	Death penalty is something that should be abolished. I don't know, I'm not talking from a legal point of view, but from a moral point of view that no one has a right to take another person's life, if crime is committed the punishment should be corrective and something where the criminal should go through repent. Entire life in jail, or working in jail, is better than putting someone to death.
6731	Depends. Both are given due to obvious and extreme criminal offenses. But then, I would really agree with you that death penalty is something that should be abolished. I dont know, I am not talking from the legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another persons life, if crime is committed the punishment should be corrective and something where the criminal should go through repent. All the jail and torture methods are better than sending a person to death.
6732	Death penalty is something that should be abolished. I don't know, I am not talking from the legal point of view, but on a moral level that no one has a right to take another person's life, if crime is committed the punishment should be " corrective " and something where the criminal should go through repent. Entire life in jail, made to rot in jail, or made to work is better than putting someone to death.
6733	Death penalty is a form of punishment that should not be used. I don't agree with it, but it is being used. I would like to see the death penalty abolished, for obvious and extreme reasons. However, I do agree that life in jail for the rest of the criminals' lives is better than execution.
6734	Well, in answer to that, I would really agree that death penalty is something that should be abolished, from a moral point of view. In fact, I think that to pay a person to pay for the crime that they have committed would be the worst punishment there could be, and it's just another form of torture. I don't know, I am not talking from a legal point of view, but I would argue that the death penalty is something that shouldn't be used. I have seen the effect that it has, you make people very paranoid, and I'm not even saying this from a legal point of view, but from a moral point of view.
6735	If you don't believe that only felons should not be allowed to vote, well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are repeat offenders.
6736	See the text above. Yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over.

6737	When you say the necessary requirements do you mean that as long as they are not felons (since felons cannot vote period)? Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again.

6739	I don't understand that the requirements do not include felons. It doesn't matter if felons can vote or not, we should always be loyal to our country in the event of our death. For example, if you accidentally kill someone in a conflict, should you pay the price? Would you have been willing to take the bullet for your country when you were able to do so? Or do you think you should give that up after being able to walk away? What is the difference between murdering someone and desiring a nation to move on? I think we should be loyal to our country, and those killed in a conflict should not be able to walk away.
6740	Our leaders believe that the U.S. cannot afford NOT to be friendly to China - a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us. Cubans, on the other hand, have very little to offer economically.  So we can afford to play the bully, to assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere and freeze out the Cubans in the hopes that Castro (or, more likely, the guy who comes after him) will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
6741	In my point of view, the U.S. can afford to be friendly with China because China is a huge emerging market, producers of low-cost consumer products, etc. So even though the Chinese are just as anti-democratic as the Cubans, even though the Chinese undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than Castro's Cuba, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need China as much as China needs us.

6742	Befriending a country that relies on people who practice human rights violations on a massive scale is incredibly unwise for America.  It's also incredibly unwise to let anti-Castro regimes overwhelm our counterparts in Latin America, which are as much a part of the American family as the Cuban colony is. The drive to be seen as protector of the hemisphere to the exclusion of any other nation of importance will eventually set back the United States.
6743	Even though the Chinese people are the same animals that the people in Cuba are, because of our friendships with China, we will give them a pass. Cuba, on the other hand, has very little to offer economically. We can afford to play the bully, assert our Monroe Doctrine dominance over the hemisphere, and freeze out the Cubans in the hope that Castro will fall from power and we can go back to making Cuba the pro-U.S. cheap-sugar-and-smokes satellite that it was for decades.
6744	The U.S. (so the politicians believe) cannot afford NOT to be friendly to Cuba, a huge, developing and economic opportunities. So even though the Cubans are just as anti-democratic as the Chinese, even though the Cubans undoubtedly have a more horrific human rights record than the Chinese, even though they meddle and interfere with Bush's interests in Central Asia, we give them a pass because we need Cuba as much as Cuba needs us. Cuba is an absolutely essential country for the U.S. economy, mainly because it is an equitable nation without any undisputed advantages to its neighbors that the U.S. would enjoy in a conflict against them.  We need to further tighten our economic grip on the island to keep out communism.
6745	Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq because he was "covering" the Americans' battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He should have been hung.
6746	You have missed the point.  When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American people (nuclear secrets, etc), you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole.  Freedom of the press means that you can publish what you want, but it doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences. Gerald Gallo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. He shoulda been hung.
6747	Confidential sources within the government that leak classified information are not covered by the freedom of the press. When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story. Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another. When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American people (nuclear secrets, etc) you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole. Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want, it doesn't mean you are free of the consequences. Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Baghdad before the battle. He should have been hung.
6748	Elaine Smith, the layperson on the firing squad of the newly-created lawyer magazine, battled to stay within the bounds of legality, but also to protect her editor from prosecutions.  Her courage wasn’t the only reason she was named in the biggest libel lawsuit in America this year... So she must be defended, and defended vigorously. She is not a guinea pig. She is a whistle-blower.
6749	The person that leaks critical information to the enemy is unworthy to be protected by the American people.  When you have a trusted source within the government that leaks classified information and threatens the safety of the American people, you might be obligated to give up a case against that person to resolve another important case or information.  Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want.  It doesn't mean you are not accountable for the consequences.  Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq because he leaked the American battle plans for Baghdad before the battle.  He shoulda been hung for his leak.
6750	Our constitutional right to privacy was definitely negated in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, it seems too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop the legal way. Bush is just trying to cover his butt, as well as other members of our government are doing so. There are many conspiracy theories floating around concerning Bush and a few other members of our government, I think it is time the people of this nation take our government back, too many "actors" in power with selfish intentions!

6753	The right to privacy has definitely been compromised in this situation. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capabilities, I do not think it would be too hard for them to get a warrant to eavesdrop legal. In this case, it has been used by our government to make allegations against the citizens. I think that it is time for our government to be taken back from the people who abuse it. There are many conspiracies going on concerning Bush and a few other members of the government and I think it is time for the people to take our government back from all of the corrupting actors in power.
6754	In terms of our constitutional right to privacy the government is definitely not listening to our legal reasoning. If the government suspects someone of having terroristic capability they do not have to get a warrant to listen to the legal reasoning. George W.

6755	The similarity between OJ and Scott is that both of them were connected to the football culture and both murderers involved in a women affair. They are not murderers because both of them killed their pregnant wives, because OJ actually had contact with and killed the mother of his children, and because a lot of the death penalty supporters say that Scott's case needed to have to sentence OJ's was not that extreme. The difference between OJ and Scott is the fact that OJ was a celebrity. People looked at him, and had time to have a thought about how OJ should be sentenced. He made it to trial, he was sentenced, and now that he's dead, almost nobody talks about it.
6756	In the 2000 election, Scott Peterson was the white juxtaposition to OJ. He wasn't a celebrity, he was an "everyman". Like OJ, he killed the mother of his children. The similarities stop there. His image was good, and we watched it for the same reason we watched Michael Douglas and Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Scott is just an average white guy. As with most people who have an affair, particularly when the wife is at home pregnant, his version of reality went off the reservation. It was a warning sign to the rest of us. 1) Don't lose sight of reality and think that life will be great after you kill your pregnant wife and hook up with the psycho-chic who was f**king you while your wife was pregnant. 2) If you are an average white guy, you do not get off for a crime like OJ got off. It still seems that a black celebrity can work his celebrity magic on a jury - right Michael?

6759	Can we kill tv because only tv can bring u live news at books u can't find also it's educational
6760	Disagree with the previous writer, that the death penalty is more expensive than life in prison in the USA.  Well, in the USA, some of the courtroom procedures can be carried out by a sitting judge which can also serve as a judge in the final trial, so the lives in prison part is not as bad as the previous writer thought.
6761	Disagree.  Firstly, it is Singaporeans who should decide on it.  Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non tolerance of those who seek to undermine society. Singapore is a society that tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created. However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore. It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty. Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.
6762	Disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore who should decide if they want the death penalty applied to offenders.  Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to Singapore's non tolerance of those who seek to undermine the society they have created.

6763	Disagree. Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision. Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

6764	There is no need for the death penalty here. The Singaporean people are the ones who determine the laws that effect their country and they can decide to end the death penalty.
6765	If you really want to "defend marriage", then repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a felony. That would "defend marriage" - except half of Congress would be sitting in jail. {probably not a bad idea
6766	In the words of Martin Luther King, I say it again. I do not say that I am against divorce. My point is that if you do not like the conditions of your marriage, you should try to make it better or leave it. If not, then leave.
6767	Don't be concerned that they'll listen to your phone calls or read your e-mail. You're entitled to privacy if your fear is genuine. But if you keep making sense, they will start paying attention to you. Don't worry about that.
6768	Be careful. If you keep making sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail. Oops, too late.\nFrankly, if they really wanted to "defend marriage", they should repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a felony. That would "defend marriage" - except half of Congress would be sitting in jail.
6769	Like I said in my blog, anytime that a chapter of the constitution calls for a "reference standard", it means something specific and doesn't mean anything else. Most of the time, a reference standard is a perfect war crime that could be enforced but it's not actually enforced. This time, however, we're speaking of the introduction of a religion and raising the children in that religion.
6770	Whether people actually have that right is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information citizens can freely receive. In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving citizens' rights. Any country has a segment of people who would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered rights. Depending on the political party, there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish control and those who do not.
6771	The concept that people have this *right* is an ethical question. I support the position that all have this right.  Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive.  In India, there are domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information (1).  Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered *rights*. Regardless of political party there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
6772	Yes. The idea that people have this right is an ethical issue and I support the idea that everybody has that right, whether or not they actually do. Whether people do actually have that right is a legal issue based on the laws of their country. China has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. India's domestic rights organizations are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information. There are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish controls and those who do not want controls.
6773	First of all, the idea that people have this right is an ethical question and I support the position that all have the right. Whether people actually have it is a legal question based on the laws of their country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive.

Every country has a segment that restricts information and any of the other qualities that are considered rights. Regardless of political party, there are essentially two kinds of people; those who wish to have controls and those who do not want the controls.
6774	Every country has a segment that would restrict information and any of the other qualities that are considered 'rights'. The segment would be one of political party, but is inherently governed by the laws of the country. China, for example, has government policies in place that restrict the information the inhabitants can freely receive. India, has domestic rights organizations that are vigilant in protecting and preserving the citizens perceived rights including that of information.
6775	If you are proud to be whoever you are you shouldn't be discriminated against just because you were born with a different set of genetics. I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa, just because of their race. And on top of that, they get money for being they. So congratulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
6776	That's what I'm trying to say. Sure, rather than celebrating what they were given as positions, they will always know they didn't have to work as hard as other people because they were given positions instead. I think reverse discrimination fuels a new form of racism. The way I see it, only blacks get into college with low test scores/gpa because they get money for being their race. There are whites that get into college as well, but if you tell people about this, they'll label you as a racist. So congratulations to our superior intelligence, they made us racist!
6777	Yes. Reverse discrimination fuels a new type of racism. I hate the people who got into college with low test scores/gp even just because of their race. And on top of that they get money for being their. So congratulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
6778	The key is to achieve quality education for all students and because only education can make a student into a global citizen. We should be proud of what they accomplished, and we shouldn't be ashamed of what they didn't. We should celebrate all students, no matter what their background, which is why it's reverse discrimination. R.D. you have made me into a racist.
6779	There's no right reason to be proud of accomplishment in a society that perpetuates racism. R.D. and anyone who's like him really should hate this group of people. He's laying the groundwork for the new type of racism in our country.
6780	Take the blame away from sanitation workers because they fought for better wages, benefits and more importantly for an education.  Take the blame away from union leaders who fell for their diatribes.  Take the blame away from American employers that are forcing people out of the country.  Where else can uneducated people find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days?
6781	Because only Americans are getting out of jobs because they are not educated, they are pointing their fingers at immigrants, the unions, and the employers.  Employers are being forced into hiring immigrants because they are desperate for employees and forced to hire people that do not receive health insurance or vacation or paid sick days.  Immigrants are being forced into working at a low wage, only to fight for some benefits they should have been given all along.
6782	Blame the sanitation workers who fought for better wages, benefits, etc., instead of fighting for an education. Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their diatribe. American citizens are doing themselves out of jobs. Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers. Where else can uneducated people who do not fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation, and paid sick days?
6783	Blame the sanitation workers for fighting for better wages, benefits, etc. instead of fighting for an education.  Blame the unions, and blame the employers for falling for their diatribe.  Americans are doing themselves out of jobs.  Don't point a finger at immigrants or the employers.  Where else can uneducated people who do not fit well within society find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days?
6784	Abusive public schools provide a means for urban youths and their parents to segregate children into schools that benefit the wealthy.  Privilege does not mean I can get good jobs. I must earn them through education.  Americans are doing themselves out of jobs. Don’t point a finger at immigrants or the employers. Where else can uneducated people find work at $20 an hour with health insurance, vacation and paid sick days?
6785	Earning millions and giving millions away doesn't necessarily mean love.  Maybe others are making those payments because they are necessary.  Some people have very good reasons for being poor like people have for having Alzheimer's disease, which is more common in poorer families.  If you don't like them, then don't let them in your house. Please.  There should be laws against all sorts of creepy people, like pedophiles, rapists, and child abusers.
6786	And you're right, marriage is not real love.  But marriage is a way of laying down a piece of paper that certifies the relationship of a couple, and makes it easier to get property with your spouse.  On the other hand, it also protects that couple for things that society isn't ready to let people get away with, like divorce and child support.  Which is one good reason why there should be a license to hold to protect people's interests.  Well, except that there are some people that get their spouse's support from their employer and that person still gets paid for it and doesn't need the marriage license.  On another note, if a person didn't want to marry, there should be other options for them besides marriage.  So marriage isn't for everyone.  But I think it's very important for people to have their piece of paper saying that they want to, and hold the rights that come with it.
6787	Property rights, such as those given to marriages, don't need to be changed.  Marriage benefits people both economically and socially.  It is important to people everywhere and can be a stable basis for life.  There is no reason for it to not be considered a contract where the terms are agreed upon and only have to be witnessed.
6788	I'm not a fan of it because with marriage, everything gets property rights.  If you do not want to stay with the person, or have children, or make your property community with them, there is no need to enter into it lightly. People shouldn't enter into it lightly. And I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of it were eliminated. People wouldn't marry for money, or insurance, etc...
6789	As far as property is concerned, and for raising children, and for protecting women, and for expanding the divorce rate, it is a protection for the sake of women and children.  If you don't plan on staying with someone, or having children, or making property community, there is no need for a license and no need for it.  People shouldn't enter into it lightly, and I think it would help the divorce rate if the benefits of marriage were eliminated. People couldn't marry for money, insurance, life, etc...
6790	No.  Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floogging and capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be floogged or executed.  Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
6791	No.  Even if you say that any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in their justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.  Where the majority votes for punsishment, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
6792	No.  Any society that values the value of a human life would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in its justice system.  Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
6793	No.  In any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions, would be hypocritical to include floodgating and capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be punished by floodgating or execution.  Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
6794	No.  Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include floating and capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be thrown overboard or executed.  Where punnishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best barristers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.
6795	We have a tendency to exonerate ourselves when ever we see fit on what ever the matter might be.  I don't see where this would be no different.  The idea that the church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception.  If it shows flaw, misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections.  So to answer the question yes, I feel it does exonerate itself.
6796	One of the most important aspects of the church is that it exones itself from most of its failures.  If it shows misjudgment, mismanagement, misdemeanors, whatever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections? To answer your question, no, I do not feel it does exonerate itself.
6797	I don't see where this would be different. The idea that the church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something it has tried to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If the church shows flaws, misjudgment, mismanagement, what ever the case might be, can it see itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections? So to answer the question yes I feel it does exonerate itself.
6798	If the church sees itself as the body of Christ with all its imperfections, so is there to be an apology to any one other than those that were directly involved in a problem situation.  The church should apologize to others, but can not offer an apology for itself when it thinks it has done nothing wrong.
6799	The Church has a tendency to exonerate itself, and since it has built its great reputation on this principle, it is not exceptional. I don't see where this would be any different. The idea that the church is not flawed and is the body of Christ is something that it has been trying to hold to the highest degree since its conception. If it is flawed, misjudged, or mismanaged, can it see itself as the body of Christ, all of its imperfections? So, to answer the question, yes, I feel it does exonerate itself.
6800	It certainly can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harassment and the company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it. The United States has laws in place that prohibits anyone from working in a hostile work environment. The first step you need to take is to contact the human resource (or personnel) department of your workplace and tell them your story. You need to write down what was said, the date it was said if you remember, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it. If the human resource department does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office.

6801	It certainly can if you have the right attorney. Racial remarks are a form of sexual harassment. The company, along with the person, and the supervisor can be held liable for it. The USA has laws in place that prohibits anyone from having to work in a hostile work environment. The first step you need to take is to contact the human resources (or personnel) department of your workplace and tell them your story. You need to write down what was said, the date it was said if you remember, and who was, if anyone, a witness when the person said it. If the human resource department does not do anything about this, go above their head and contact the main office.

6805	Black people do not normally remove the "er" from words except in doubt. They usually just say it: n i 99a, mi brother.
6806	Among black people, saying "neva" is the rule, not the exception. So, anyway, even when we do not put in the "er", when we will have forged ourselves in our speech will be the degradation. I have been black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it. (sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but i ALWAYS correct myself). I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny". When I was in college, I suggested Not my "ni99a, my brother" day, and it worked.
6807	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" is no difference. Think about it, Most Black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while white people don't. So the actual pronunciation does not take away from the degradation of the word. I have been black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it.(sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but I ALWAYS correct myself). I hate that word, and it's use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny".

6810	pro-life doctors are just as biased as pro-choice doctors. Pro-choice doctors kill unborn babies like abortionists.  Pro-lifers allow the outlawed murder of children.
6811	Abortion should be banned by law. There are pro-choice doctors and doctors who encourage abortion because they hate the child in the womb. There are both pro- and anti-abortion doctors.
6812	Liberal politicians like Annie Red have taken a pass on pro-life politicians like Ron Paul.  You should have every opportunity to hear your opinions heard.
6813	What are your reasons that make you believe that anyone other than women who become pregnant should have a child? The answer to this question is far from logical because it's not possible to say that you have rational reasons for thinking in a particular way, and yet you appear to be so evil for saying the opposite.  For example, if you say that someone should get pregnant before he or she is even born because he'll or she will later screw up if not, then you are saying that before he or she is even born, that person has already violated the law. Your reasoning is too far-fetched.  Mothers who get pregnant by rape have a choice when it comes to aborting their child.  By doing so, they're not following the law.  Women who are still menstruating do not have to go to jail for performing abortion of rape victims.  The fact that you can legally be jailed for performing an abortion does not mean that abortion is always good for humanity. Do you know the words of Scripture that say "The murderer cannot inherit the kingdom of God"? I hope that you realize that our beliefs are not all based on logic. Just because abortion is permitted in some countries doesn't mean that it will be allowed in all countries.
6814	The majority of pro-life doctors practice abortions based on religious and financial motives. They won't bother considering the parents' instincts for their unborn child.
6815	 Money is not the root of all evil, the LOVE of money is. The meaning of this statement is, that people put money above the Great Spirit (god, Buddha, whatever you call your higher power), before family, friends, all they care about is getting more money. And love IS the greatest thing in the world. The problem is that people love money!

6820	If it's okay for adults to commit adult crimes, why should it be all teenage offenders.
6821	There is no crime bigger than adultery if it happened within the marital relationship. If adultery is committed outside the marital relationship it's a felony and should be treated that way. If you continue to allow young adulterers the benefit of the doubt then we're going to have a greater crime problem in the future. The young adults that are being charged with these crimes do deserve to go to adult court but we must make sure that the justice is done just like we give the same punishment to the crimes that were committed by an adult. We must stay safe and protect ourselves and our loved ones and this should be done no matter how old we are.
6822	Any time you steal from someone or anybody, steal something they don't owe you, do something against their will, get drunk and cause problems you have to go to jail.
6823	It all depends on the crime. For the most part, if your grown enough to go and do an adult crime then you need to do the adult time. If we continue to let the youth get away with serious crimes, older crimebodies will continue to get our youth in trouble. We must raise our children correctly so they want to end up in some prison but there are certain things that is morally wrong no matter if you're 15 or 35, and those are the crimes our young "adults" should be charged for.

6825	If you have a lawyer, let him or her know. If you don't have a lawyer, get one. You should contact the court to determine if there is a scheduled hearing for Friday.  Even though you might not have been served with papers, it wouldn't be a good idea to ignore this situation. For you all you, your ex might have gotten someone to falsify a proof of service to show that you were properly served.  You might have to request a continuance and properly prepare for the hearing. If there is a hearing and you don't show up, the court might make and adverse ruling against you that could be difficult to undo.

6830	tv is a big television based entertainment medium, whereas Twitch is a very popular platform for gamers to broadcast their own gameplay sessions.  If YouTube were to take over Twitch, they would help a lot with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though.  Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel.  Also, if Youtubers had YouTube's help, they might be more selective when filming their content and cut down on quality issues.  Youtube could also be then catering to a wider audience, thus making YouTube bigger.  In the past, I've been against some of the things that has happened to YouTube, such as the Google+ integration. But I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Twitch.  Just to note, I do understand that YouTube own Youtube.  I'm an avid user of YouTube, watching a ton of videos a day and creating my own content. Therefore, if there are any downsides, I want to know about them and try to prevent them happening to me.
6831	My opinion is that YouTube can take over Twitch because it would run a lot smoother than Twitch does now and because Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel.
6832	tv because only tv can bring u live news at books u can't find also it's educational
6833	Some use Youtube because of how awesome it is. But why should it be integrated into Twitch? This would create too many changes and not fix the problems that Twitch has. I've been against the integration before but now I'm not really sure if it's a good idea.
6834	Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game.  If Twitch were to take over Youtube, they would help a lot with the servers and so Youtube would run faster. This is just my speculation though.  Also, Twitchers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel.  Twitchers could also be helping Twitch with streaming and this would help promote Twitch.  In the past, I've been against some of the things that's happened to Twitch, such as the sudden ban on the latest For Honor and their recent ban of gold badges. But I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Youtube.  Just to note, I do understand that Youtube belong to Google.  I'm an avid Youtube user, watching several videos throughout the day, and uploading my own content. So if there are any downsides, I want to know about them and put things in place to try and stop them happening to me.
6835	Whether the government does have the right idea that teenagers shouldn't be drinking alcohol is debatable. However, nobody who has passed his or her teenage years should be denied the right to drink. Obviously, they shouldn't be 18 years old, because that would give easy access to high school kids. The current drinking age of 21 completely undermines the 20th birthday. I think the current age of 21 is absolutely irrelevant. Instead of celebrating, most people just simply gloss over their 20th birthday. They simply don't care because they are adults and are not young at heart.
6836	Even though the government is right about banning teenage drinking, I don't think it should be their only concern. Teens should not be denied their right to have fun. They should definitely be able to drink. However, the age should not be so high that it makes it impossible for teenagers to partake in their first drink. It should be 21, the age of discretion and maturity.
6837	The government has a good idea that teenagers shouldn't be drinking alcohol, but in my view, nobody who has passed his or her teenage years should be denied. Obviously it should not be 18, because that would give easy access to high school kids. The current drinking age of 21 completely undermines the 20th birthday, the dawn of a new decade, arguably the most important of one's life. Instead of celebrating, most people just simply gloss over their 20th birthdays, just waiting the extra year.   Should we skip our 30th birthdays and wait until 31 for a big celebration? 41 instead of 40? Obviously not.

6840	In the UK every few years, the governments' 'cabinet' has a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years, elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position? The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system, then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me, either.
6841	In the UK every few years cabinet members have a reshuffle and the minister in charge of, for example, education moves job to become minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more sensible if every few years the people for each relevant position were voted for directly, rather than people appointed by a government to a position purely for their political preferences. This would then be the responsibility of the public to set what qualifications they wanted in terms of their position, rather than the government imposing their own. We would then work to make sure experts would be able to uphold the decision-making responsibility. I can't tell you how useful this would be, especially in education where the government say they want specialist knowledge, but no-one can be allowed to make decisions that exceed their qualifications.
6842	Cabinet is a term for ministers of state or diplomats - senior high level in the British government.  In Britain, a reshuffle of the 'cabinet' is a term for a reshuffle or a change of the head of an organisation (similar to a re-organization). Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position.  The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - I assume that by 'No Sense' you mean that it would be impossible to keep up to date on all relevant policies from such a complex system.  edit:  By academic I meant something along the lines of 'A recognised subject matter expert with relevant experience' rather than implying only university professors could hold office.
6843	In the UK every few years the government get's a reshuffle and the minister in charge of education moves job to become the minister in charge of transport. Surely it would be more logical if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position. Currently, the current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire education system and then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nation's healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me.
6844	It is smart to reshuffle the cabins whenever it makes sense to do so, however a good system would be to hold elections where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position.  The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - since their experience would be irrelevant to them having responsibility for these areas.
6845	I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or and extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school. Change my view!

6847	It's not like an entire generation has grown up with parents lecturing them on how to live. People have to learn from the lives of others and evaluate their own choices. The child would never be so content if his mom was always lecturing him about being good.

6850	My school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However a smart terrorist or whomever could easily find this out (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to just run to my car (off campus) and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school tells us whether or not we have a drill that day so I would know if its a legitimate threat. CCTV.
6851	In cases where a bomb threat happens, the entire student body in school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However, a smart terrorist (or whomever) could easily find out about this (every school does the same and says it on our website) and plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to run to my car (off campus) and escape instead of standing in our stadium and waiting out until authorities arrive. Running is much more critical and should be more important than waiting out in a stadium for police or bomb squads. I would call 911 and alert the authorities right away and not just sit there and wait for hours until they arrive. The key is to stay alive and get out as quickly as possible

6853	To be honest, I would never take that car because we have a policy that if a bomb threat occurs, all students and faculty must leave in our stadium. However, a smart terrorist could easily find out this and would definitely plant a bomb in said stadium to kill all the student body and staff. It would make more sense to run to my car (off campus) and escape. It is well worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school informs us on the web site whether or not we have a drill that day or not so I would know if it is a legitimate threat. If it is a legitimate threat, it would make no sense to wait for security because security probably wouldn't come. So for me to stand here is useless and if I knew I had a real bomb threat that day, I would hide until the bomb squad came.
6854	Our school has a policy where if there is a bomb threat the entire school must pile up in our stadium and wait out until police and a bomb squad come. However, a smart terrorist or whomever could easily find out this is a scam and could plant a bomb in said stadium killing the entire student body and staff. It would make more sense for me to run to my car (off campus) and escape. It's better to save my life than put up with this racket! I would prefer to go home and just say I'm sick. It's worth saving my life 100% of the time. It would be better for me to simply run away in the middle of the night, but I worry about getting pregnant out of school.
6855	"Public officials" might really be elected, though the process is hardly transparent and verifiable by most voters, but they rarely face penalties for making their bad ideas into laws that others have sworn to enforce. This also applies to the enforcers.  If they do experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election.  In extremely rare cases they might spend some months in the fanciest prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences. "Public officials" take advantage of ample opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which favor the special interests.  The officials then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, in addition to numerous other kickbacks; namely, lucrative "consulting" gigs and the like.  Why are most people okay with this?  Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine?

6860	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. I don't see why anybody cares. The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there are few teams ducking it out, and a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other. People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in almost any sport. True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team. Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
6861	From a logic standpoint, why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?

The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win. Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other. People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport. True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team. Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?
6863	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced. It can be hard to put my mind to buying into a system in which every team is a middle-of-the-pack team.  There are no arguments against having a handful of titans like Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Atletico, but why would I want to change a system in which every team is at, or would be, a respectable level and where high-performance doesn't translate to a championship (plus it seems like a waste to spend millions of dollars in physical academics and facilities for a team that'll never win anything)? Why change for something that could be even better? It's true that most people will be excited by rivalries between two of the big three or about a new league competition that resembles the Super Bowl. But it's a small segment of the sports fan base. There are too many other distractions that could make sports more exciting and entertaining, for a game that in the end won't be much better than a boxing match.

6865	In point of view, whatever you do just do it conscientiously. You may not like all the people here, but you have to be polite and if there are disagreements, then just say that you're disagreeing and stop with the argumentative rant. If you don't want to use them, use your own toilet. Don't expect the toilet to be clean, especially when you use it before others. How about using theirs after? That way you don't have to wait for everyone in the office to finish using them. Also, it's only good manners to put the seat up in case of accidents. Remember that everyone can be an accident waiting to happen.
6866	It's considerate but it's contrary to putting the seat up after use and even if it were then it just cancels the whole thing out. Also, in a large building or household, the next person to use the toilet could be male and need to urinate and he now needs to put the seat up again. Finally, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
6867	In the office: I used a good seat after. We've been very family friendly in the works. Any time I would go up and down stairs, I would get in my waterless seat and go. Otherwise, we kept a good pedal-to-the-metal culture.  And keeping a good pedal-to-the-metal culture is essential because it helps with the management of COVID.  Now, in my experience, the only large buildings I've been in with a guy who uses the toilet, every penny he coughed up to hold his seat for any length of time.  There was zero regard for cleanliness there. And, of course, the sign on the door reads "wear gloves" and "you disinfect after you use this towel."  Also, the custom across all societies is that most important people deal with the disgusting stuff of life and put the out of sight to the right side of their mind. First and foremost, the bathroom is private so it has to be thought of as a right of the person being that used it.  What in the fuck is wrong with that attitude?   In your circle of friends? Maybe they are the exception? I do it a lot, because it doesn't take up any space and I don't have to announce it to anyone.  People seem to like it in the cinema if it's not used all the time, so that probably is where it's come from.   My grandfather made it onto a cereal box that we mostly didn't eat.   Actually it's always illegal to prohibit toilet seats
6868	Granted I've never had trouble with this issue with a significant other, but once I was in an office building and once I stayed at a female friend's home (the latter of which I understand because it's her house and she wanted it maintained a certain way).  There is an argument that it's considerate but the counterpart is putting the seat up after use. And even if you put it up the next person to use the toilet could be a male and need to urinate in which case he now needs to put the seat up again. And lastly, why the fuck would you use a shared toilet without looking before using it while expecting male users to do the looking for both themselves and the women.
6869	Obviously the easy and more dignified way to mark one's place in the area is not to use any sort of clothing. However, there's no problem with men having to go up and down multiple times in one sitting while leaving an odour or causing the next person to re-flush and require a more uptight maintenance contract. Maybe if a woman wanted to dispose of this matter herself then she might have thought two thoughts with this decision but she wouldn't need to consider any other men. With men it is a de facto simple thing to do. It's just not something we need to consider.
6870	Persons that are sentenced to death receive publicity about what actual death in the United States is like, at the very least.
6871	Our society has been in a state of rampant racism for so long that it is becoming ingrained in our behavior, in our language, and even in our laws. People are not aware of the level of racism in society at large, and people should be aware of this fact.
6872	To say that the death penalty is used primarily as a retaliation is not true. In the United States, the death penalty is used for a variety of reasons, some of which include homicide, terrorism, domestic terrorism, child abuse, and other crimes committed by well-known criminals. Since the United States has a system that uses capital punishment, it should be able to clearly establish what crime has been committed.
6873	If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty).

6875	This is my second opinion; basically speaking, I think that the public has a right to know about the current crime statistics but shouldn't disclose the names of the perpetrators to the general public unless it involves a security risk (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned.) I personally feel that by announcing the names of the perpetrators involved in a murder/suicide case only makes it so other criminals commit similar crimes for the sake of media attention. That being said I don't feel that the events should be covered up, but that the specific names of criminals involved should be kept from the public. CMV.
6876	Generally, in cases of murder or self-inflicted injuries, if the names of perpetrators are not publicly disclosed, less risk of the same criminal committing these types of crimes again is felt in the public's opinion. In cases where the perpetrator is currently at large or in prison, or cases where crime/violence is too terrible/horrible for viewing by the public, then the case can be explained in a safer manner in view of the political climate.
6877	In my opinion it's ridiculous to list the names of a murder/suicide victims (or even just cases), even when those incidents are reported to the police, unless the real criminals are currently at large or in jail. Having the name of the victims and perpetrators publicly does little more than create rumors and speculations that can be used as justification for unexplained killings. What better way can there be to fight crime than by making public the names of the criminals?
6878	The public has a right to know about such events, but should not disclose the name(s) of the perpetrators to the general public unless it's a matter of security (the criminal is currently at large or imprisoned). I personally feel that by announcing the names of the perpetrators involved in a murder/suicide case only makes it so other criminals commit similar crimes for media attention. That being said, I don't feel that the events should be covered up, but that the specific names of criminals involved should be kept from the public. CMV.
6879	Having the public know the identities of the perpetrators is just a way of spreading the gossip about those perpetrators and it never stops. But publicizing the events in order to protect the public is certainly something that I would support. CMV.
6880	It seems the more we learn about climate change, the more we realize how scary the picture is, and the more it seems that we have only just begun to scratch the surface of how the Earth’s systems interact.  At this early stage in the evolution of climate science we don’t know enough to predict what life will be like in 2100, and until that picture becomes clearer we should operate under a much more pessimistic M.O. just in case.
6881	it seems the more we learn about climate change, the scarier the picture becomes and the more it seems that we've only just begun to scratch the surface of how the Earth's systems work and interact. The high-level predictions (more drought, higher oceans, etc) are important, but it will be the more nuanced insights which today remain scarce that will give us a real understanding of what the world will be like in the coming decades and centuries.

6885	This is my honest opinion. And while I won't support the woman's choice to have an abortion, I would still ask to have an unbiased conversation.
6886	By focusing on so many individual misfeeds, we are overlooking that all of these misfeeds are linked and lead to a singular misfeed of environmental destruction.
6887	You can brush your teeth while you piss standing up. There is no advantage to sitting down unless you are relaxing and it is very comfortable. Also, there are few people who have to do so if their bladder is doing the talking.
6888	Water bottles are pretty much a needless waste of resources because they can't be recycled and people actually pay for a bottle of water that may not even get drunk out of, let alone go into a hotel. So if water bottles get banned people probably won't go anywhere for privacy either, which is what makes them a huge waste of resources and money.
6889	 CMV: Common Man Virus? or had I just fucked up?
6890	Being pretty average, I think I will become more attractive/handsome more girls will check me, and that will boost my confidence to approach them or even make them approach me. I also think that having a really attractive face will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.
6891	I'm a really young male (19) but I'm seriously considering having a rhinoplasty, chin, jaw and cheek augmentation. I think that once I get the procedures done I'll become dramatically more attractive/handsome more girls will check me and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face (and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.  Here is an rewired text that made a lot of changes!!!... :)
6892	As you get older your facial features change. Just to give you an idea, a young man will find a lip fill and nose job to be very attractive, but an older male will find the same to be unappealing. Some very young men will find some surgery to be a very attractive option for themselves but once they reach a certain age they will likely start finding it unacceptable. I do not think that a combination of the three that I mentioned are desirable at any time unless the youthful appeal is tempered with the older appeal.

6895	Get over here. The most over-rated saying coming from that desert dweller. I'd much rather be too cold than too hot. Sub-zero has a vast range of moves that trump the most of his rivals. If anything Scorpion should "get over himself!" instead. Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Including the ability to freeze opponents and be able to walk up and smacking them in the lip. The ability to freeze anything from thin air is a complete use of magic. Very useful for sliding down hills, freezing any object. Want a cold drink? Boom. Popsicle. Change my view?》.

6897	Unlike Traci, the family of Matt thought his problems were shallow; Traci's was much deeper and destructive. Also in the movie, when Matt gave himself the gift, he came out as gay and he feels compelled to use that gift to help other people. And, he did. 
6898	Overrated saying is coming from desert wandering sand, you see Scorpion is much stronger than Rin despite that sweet little bubble. Now having Niobe with it means I can combine the best of Sub-zero and Daigotsu. We have only seen that combo happen in the last fight but I have a feeling Rin will be able to think of something better than shock foe with the ice magic. Darkness & fire can't be combined. Light & Fire is fine.

Sub-zero has a better body temperature, which I'm sure is mostly lower than the average ninja. Changing the view can be made available by others in the game too. Eternal Mead. Thin air key supported a variety of moves, including "Grand Slam", where Sub-zero kicked opponents at once, and "Crosstalk," which meant that despite changing view, his abilities remained unchanged. Sub-zero considered such techniques to be both impressive and deadly.
6900	The problem with the "rapehide" idea is that it's just giving guys an excuse to stick the knife in the back of girls they never met.   It doesn't make them a less worthy rapist because they haven't actually fucking done it yet.   It's probably more effective to teach boys that they don't deserve to be raping anyone and have them rethink their actions.   It's probably even more important that girls teach boys that to rape someone is wrong.   I know this sounds bold, but it may be the key to our society changing from the current kind of insane "safer than ever" paranoia about rapes.
6901	Violent crime has decreased, but rape is still a very serious offense. On the flip side, with the internet we have the ability to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth. So most people agree that rape is wrong, but believe that many rapes are not reported because of the pervasiveness of rape culture. Also, almost every girl knows there are perpetrators everywhere.  On the other hand, women know they should not get raped, but on an average day they encounter a rapist. There are also a lot of cases where women go home with men that are not the rapist because they are afraid to speak up. However, people often claim that they will not get raped, but they are not sure. This can be shown by research.
6902	When did rape become culturally taboo? The odds of being a victim of a violent crime are lower than ever before.   However, the internet has the power to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth at any given moment. This generally only means that our nightmares are multiplied. If you cannot handle rape, go out and get married. Everyone really does have a dark side when you're just walking down the street.   Don't worry. In most cases, you won't be the victim.   As long as you watch your back and all that stuff, you won't have to worry about being a victim of rape.
6903	It's not rape, it's a prostitute. Most abused women are prostitutes. And what's that got to do with rape?
6904	Chill dude, rape can happen anywhere. In fact, there's probably a more dangerous place than a club. Ew! Oh wait, I get it. It's where you're supposed to be uncomfortable. Have you ever noticed the tables at these clubs are made of very soft wood? Like the kind you keep in hotels? Well imagine the worst night you've ever spent and cut the table open. Add some whiskey or wine. Your feet are right in front of your face and no one can see anything. Right? You've taken a corner of soft wood, set it up in a dark room and slipped on it after opening a bottle of wine. Now imagine a man grabbing your butt. When he wasn't paying attention to the floor he scraped his knee on it and left a scar. Oh. Yeah. That's the reason these tables are made of soft wood. So when the men see what they're missing, they never find out.
6905	I'm 30 years old and it seems like for the last two years we've been "at war" with al Qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens. It seems to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end. It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism. I think the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end. 9/11 made the world afraid of "terrorism" and in theory every terrorist attack in the world would be just another type of "terrorism" so in theory any conflict is justified by "terrorism" from one side or the other. I think it also shows what a war-mongering, profit making machine the Pentagon has become.
6906	I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly twenty five years we have at war with al Qaeda/Terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expense of using that GDP to help our own citizens.  It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).  It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.  To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.
6907	In theory, the military industrial complex will be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" and use a pretext of some sort such as, say, terrorist attacks such as 9/11 as an excuse to fund military adventurism. In reality, because that's never going to end. Even if some terrorist attacks do happen on American soil, they will be it is nice to be at war with some very generic concept of terrorism. Don't forget that by increasing military spending to the point of causing upheaval to the American economy, the military industrial complex "gets big profits out of it" by relying on contracting rather than relying on direct armed forces.  It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

6915	I've been to four methods of education. The problem with all of them is that they rely on memorization instead understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading. Education should improve where students can pick their classes. Though, I understand, some classes are needed. But, others aren't. Schools should not use the same routine for every student. Some students will never be good at certain subjects and never wish to be. For them, schools should take those classes out of the schedule (depending on the class), and replace it with something they plan on having a career in. Economics should also be in the prime schedule. Many house foreclosures come from people who know little in the world of economics and rely on other people to manage their money.
6916	Forget those methods of schooling. I am sure I am not the only person who has had her or his take in her schooling. Writing a essay is definitely the best way to learn.
6917	I've been to four schools. The problem with all of them is that they focus on memorization instead understanding the concept of what is being taught. I have honestly learned more from reading. I think that school education should improve by giving students more independence. Some subjects may not be suitable for them to learn and may not be fun to learn as well. They should not be forced to pick the same class every day, it may make them bored and they will only learn about it from a textbook. Different types of classes should be available for students in the future. Every student could pick a class that he will like, and do well at. However, other classes may be completely useless for their future. For example, banking is great for an economist or doctor in the future, but it is useless for a lawyer or engineer. In economics, students should be able to examine the logic and reason behind the classes they picked, they should not be obliged to learn, but asked to look at it. But, in many cases, students only want the answers, and will not know how to do it, so they will have to go and learn it from a textbook.
6918	In my opinion, I have seen all four methods of schooling. They all have advantages and disadvantages. Students learn better when they get to grips with the concept rather than just memorise it. Economics should be a required class for a career because many people are left poor because they don't understand or learn about it. 
6919	Many house foreclosures come from people who don't know a lot about economics. They depend on others to manage their money. Economics is in the prime schedule.

6925	Europe is not a physical landmass but rather a cultural area. There is no major division between Europe and Asia. Some might argue that the Ural Mountains separate Europe from Asia, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain. Continents are generally divided by vast oceans and seas, not mountain ranges. Strong Europeans just didn't want to be associated with Asia and wanted to be considered their own cultural realm.

Some might argue for the Ural Mountains as a barrier if you look at it from a satellite view, but no other continents are divided by a single mountain chain.

6930	Impeachment of a president at this state in our nation's history would be disastrous and catastrophic. All of those who believe that president Obama is such an awful president must not realize he is not the one who originally put us into such a sorry economic state. If he continues improving the economy it is possible that we can set ourselves back on the correct track.
6931	The impeachment of a president at this state in our nation's history would be disastrous, but not as catastrophic as the one the American people received after George Bush II, It had nothing to do with the legislation he passed. He caused much more harm to the country by defeating our troop in a major war, there was a legitimate concern that it was going to be done, but Bush went the wrong way and he and the Supreme Court made a costly mistake.

6935	However, you can legally tell people what they can and can't read, write, or listen to, as long as it does not directly harm others. For example, if you are reading, writing, or listening to a direct order to kill someone innocent, and intend to follow that order, it's illegal. You certainly have no right to tell people what they view in their own homes, away from you and impressionable minds in society. Viewing porn in private is legal.

6940	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, then if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us no matter how more intelligent, until it has achieved the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms. If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at the same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal.
6941	Depending on which side of the debate you are on, it would either be equal or superior or inferior. If you're one of the creationists or evolutionists, then it would be equal. If you're an atheist or agnostic, it would be superior.
6942	Only the Lord of Rings author knows and they probably don't know either, however, they believe that this is a literal fact, so if we have an animal of sorts, that manifests human behavior and nature it would be part of God and would not be our equal. Therefore, if we had an animal this way, we'd have to ask who God is so it would be our equal. However if God did not make us and it was an original being made by a higher being then that would be God and not us our creator. This would only be the case of course if we as a "many man" God of our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in our image and likeness, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, if God did not make us and it was an original being made by another higher being then that would be God and not us.
6943	In regards to the artificial not being part of nature, it has to be replicated in nature rather than nature being replicated artificially. The only analogy is that nature was eventually created by God as an advanced form of living things just like humans on earth. Just like the human, however we are not from nature but the artificial from God. Each one have the same abilities.

6945	There are many factors that can explain Kurt Cobain's death. There is evidence of him having too much heroin in his system. The so-called suicide note is not what I would consider in the best of overall book. I would feel that other people wrote it. Kurt, himself, and another person. His credit card was reported being used after his death. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon.
6946	There is no doubt that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons. 1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult three times over 2. The note that was allegedly his suicide had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person 3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death. 4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself. Everybody is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence I feel that there is no question that he was murdered.
6947	Everyone has the right to their opinion but here are some questions to be asked before basing that opinion. Does Kurt Cobain have enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over? The "so called suicide note" that Kurt Cobain wrote and signed, had two different handwriting styles on it that have been proven to be different identities. There is no question that this note was written by two different people, and not Kurt himself. He had a credit card reported stolen soon after his death. Was anyone able to determine the owner's fingerprints on this credit card? Did they find any? Was the weapon that Cobain was thought to be murdered with used on another crime? No. It was only used on suicide. Why? Kurt already had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over. Is the record of his drug use that many people seem to be talking about true? It is easy to pick up drug use by observing it, but you can't prove that it happened. A suicide note that was written for someone else and signed with their fingerprint is no evidence that Kurt Cobain is to be believed. However, the fact that an autopsy on the cause of his death concluded there was no such thing as heroin overdose means that these theories have no foundation in facts. Also, how much is
6948	Being dead doesn't necessarily mean Kurt Cobain did not commit suicide. There is no question that he did. I feel the death was not witnessed or sustained. The death was immediate, and no pathological examination was done because if he was murdered, it would have made the investigation a lot more difficult. Teeth marks on the body were not there. Had they been, the motive for the murderer would have been far more clear. Using gloves while stabbing himself several times is not inconsiderate behavior and if he were lying on the ground, they would still be there.
6949	All those with real evidence of Kurt Cobain's murder should step forward and prove it. I feel there is no question that he was murdered.
6950	But i say yo mama is better because yo ma na is just you ma and na has neva been around as much as you ma but it is as clever and can be used for a good laugh every once in a while and it is a joke. unlike you ma is more of an insult to the people's actual ma. of corse there as been a television show on mtv named "yo ma na" and has major success on mtv and mtv2 but the show is nothing but lots of retarted people making up sencless jokes about each other's ma and they all r diffetent! but as to where you ma can be said to everything and anything! and it is alot more entertaining than "yo ma na". and thats all i have to say about that.
6951	“That’s what she said.”= “That’s what she said and according to me it is totally perfect.”
6952	In my opinion, she said better because your mama is just your mama and not been around as much as mine, but it's as clever as mine and can be used for a good laugh any time, and it is an insult to people's real mothers, like my mama as gone with everything and used for a joke, like that my me, but there was a tv show on mtv named your me and that has major success on mtv and mtv2 but the show is nothing but lots of retarted people making up simplers jokes about each others moms and they all are so different. But for where mom can be said to, things and anything and it's alot more entertaining than your me. And that's all I have to say about that.
6953	though both expressions are swear words, good old mama definitely gets the nod.
6954	Thank you for your kind words. Your mother, said, “That’s what I think.” I did not seem to be wrong. It was a true statement of fact. But let me clarify. I have never felt it necessary to explain why her word was, in fact, a rule, and not just an example of a handful of exceptions. I don’t want to live by others’ rules.
6955	Nothing the United States can do with China stands right behind North Korea. Any action you take can be counteracted. You just have to hope the Chinese can talk some sense into them. After all, there isn’t a more westernised communist nation on the earth than China. The sanctions that were currently in place only hurt the innocent citizens, it does not do much to stop the leaders. Maybe proving Japan with nuclear weapons would deter them and act as a buffer? Who knows?

6957	China is unbelievably westernised, but what they do is mostly peacefully keeping with the US since 1949. So even sanctions that apply only to the north Koreans won't really harm the Chinese. Other than that, I don't see any other tactics of war on China that can be implemented besides the nuclear weapons. Maybe proving Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer? But even that is an uncertain tactic.

6970	I do not support the idea of euthanasia. Euthanasia offers a pain free way for the patient to leave this earth on a happy note for both the person and their families. Euthanasia can be a way that people in pain due to immense amounts could go to and be put out of their pain instead of waking up each morning hping that tomorrow you won't. Euthanasia provides everyone with a safe and simple solution to end the human suffering.

6977	Trapper was a pretender, a goofball who got out while the gettin' was good. He was then back in the States in the spring of 1944, where he opened his practice (Trapper John, MD) with Barb, the wife of a military man, who had remained at home for almost two years during the war. Having toiled away in solitude by the fireside of her country home, and never planned to leave, Barb died just three weeks before she did not in Trapper's arms. Barbara and Jo were inseparable and lived in Val Thorens with Trapper. As Trapper had to return to France at the end of the summer, Jo volunteered to accompany him to Milan. Johana Gramm.

6980	Unborn people do not possess human DNA that is distinct from the mother they are in. The fact that these people are alive is evidence that the things they can sense, can be seen, and can think, think things like "that feeling that i can sense is not a feeling but I feel its the feeling" are the evidence that these people are human. The fact that a child has skin, hair, hands, legs, feet and other parts of itself, does not prove it is human. The organs that grow in the unborn are not for human use and living cells inside them are not human DNA and should not be given human rights.
6981	When the fact of a live, breathing, heart beating embryo inside a mother already demonstrates human life the real question is not "What makes a person human?" It's "Why does it matter if the embryo is human?".
6982	This is what I have learned from the "convinceme" pro choice debates. Living cells in a mothers womb, though possessing Human DNA that is distinct from the mothers, is not human life. The fact that the unborn have a heartbeat AND a distinct DNA inside the womb does not mean it is human life. The fact that an unborn may have a distinct blood type from the mother, does have a distinct DNA, the DNA is Human and the cells are all replicating and living… Does not equal human life. The unborn, though living cells that are born, come from a God that created everything… From birds to humans, all perfect and beneficial, have been perfect and beneficial from the very first moment they were formed. An unborn, whose life began with living cells that come from a perfect and beneficial God, being unique in it's perfection and beneficial nature, cannot be an evil life...      A life that was directed by a perfect God, that came from a perfect God and that going forward was guaranteed an amazing life by a perfect God, has no place in the heart of this world and is nothing short of an abomination.
6983	Our reasons are to stop an abortion that has lead to various forms of violence, suicide and even death. That same woman has aborted birth defects from drinking alcohol, smoke and pesticides. The fact that the woman may have had unhealthy relationship with her husband or father, may have caused her to want to abort her child.  We need to consider the reasons to stop an abortion, not its consequences.
6984	It is a costly or unpopular policy that can only be implemented when the economy is doing well.
6985	Deaf people can practically cure deafness with a pretty awesome device. I'm not sure what the device or procedure is called, but what you wear a device on the outside of your ear that picks up sound. That device sends this sound to a device that is inserted into your brain, and through a series of nuerons, impulses, and electrical thingies "scientific term", you can hear. It's not exact, and it takes months for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of deaf people are having these surgeries. They are working on something similiar for eyes, but it is much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.

6989	Being deaf is better than being blind. You can have devices that are placed on your ear that pick up sound, which sends it to a device that is placed in your brain, where it is converted to nervous impulses that are transmitted to the sound senses, and through nerve impulses, you can hear. It's not exact, but it takes some time for your brain to "learn" sound, but a lot of blind people are getting these surgeries. They are working on something similar for eyes, but it's much more complicated, as the eye has so many nerve endings/connections.
6990	Debates are based on evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world. Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.

6998	The Cold War is over and the USSR is gone, the Berlin Wall no longer exists. We trade with China and other socialist, communist and or dictatorship countries. There are 48 years of non -change on the current political stance and there is no other political organization or movement to replace the USSR's former position. A new policy should be established and why continue with the same old, same old? Do nothing.
6999	In the Cold War era, there were many Soviet Union's bases in many countries around the world. During these years many Americans came into contact with them. Some of the bases are still active today. The US trade in many ways with the Communist countries and with the countries around the world that were communist and dictatorship. Cuba is an example of the kind of freedom that we have and our trade relations with many countries that were communist or dictatorship. The current political stance is a failure because since 1948 no changes have been made to have a better, more intelligent, effective or democratic new world order. The existence of the Cold War has been a failure. Some people prefer to have America remain a centralized government where one person rules the country; many Americans prefer something a bit different and want to have a more democratic world order. One point you should understand is that people from all backgrounds and all ideas prefer a different world order. Those who promote democracy because they like democracy, we those who like centralization because of centralization. To discuss this issue openly is important because the current world order seems to be working according to some peoples' preferences and customs while other peoples' preferences are ignored.

7000	Yes...I think the line'school is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere' is a little much. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support removing religious references in order to accomodate all religion beliefs. I don't support any athiestic references either because I think it has no place in school. I think the line'school is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere' should be removed because this automatically implies that only objective learning can take place in schools. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support removing religious references in order to accomodate all religion beliefs. I don't support any athiestic references either because I think this has no place in school. I support removing lines that seems like indoctrination. So I support removing lines that seems like indoctrination in our school curriculum if it have an impact on students without a tendency to indoctrinate. Once again, I don't support references to any other religion. This is for the benefit of students.
7001	I completely disagree. A country is and should remain on its own and not be influenced by religious doctrine. Patriotism should not be removed from school curriculums and should be left as an option to choose by students. Also, school is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religions. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P). Further, I think issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
7002	In point of view, regardless of the religious aspect, I think that we shouldn't have it sung in schools. School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere, and introducing religion into it would simply confuse the students. It would be better if patriotism and religious bias were topics outside the school environment.
7003	Yes...I think it's a little much. On top of the religious aspect...I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools....School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me...looking back at my early school days...it seems a little like indoctrination. So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs. The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P). Further, I think issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school.
7004	Yes....I feel it is a little bit much, on top of the religious aspect I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period. School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions.

7005	When debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things, such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion, don't we? I could discuss the member who posted the debate on being illiterate, and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a comment, after all, how could the poster be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously does not get that, even if it is just a gaffe.
7006	We all make spelling mistakes sometimes. Don't we? I could bicker about the member who posted the debate on being illiterate and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark. Even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic, what's the point? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic.
7007	In my opinion, the worst problem that you can have in a debate is when the debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating about trivial things... such as misspellings. We all do it on occasion, don't we? I could bicker about the person who posted the debate on being illiterate, and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark, after all, how can a poster be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that, even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic, but what's the point?
7008	In this debate, the first post is demonstrating that they are genuinely unaware of how the debate functions. The second post is merely an attempt at being sarcastic...which only further demonstrates that the poster is genuinely ignorant of it. The third post had a rather short answer, where it focuses on 'illiteracy', which does not deal with the subject at hand. Unfortunately, these posts can be ignored. The post which mentions that they should be given time to present their points was an excellent response. To say that 'if they read and write...' is illogical...is just ignorance of how the debate is structured.
7009	The worst thing can happen when debaters spend a significant portion of their time debating things that have no actual interest or importance. We all do it on occasion, don't we? For instance, if a blogger made some sarcastic remark about an outdated spelling error that they happened to use, that blogger can then engage in lengthy debate about if they spelled it so or so. I could bicker about that blogger's illiteracy...and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could the person who created the debate and posted it on the internet be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get that, even if it's only an attempt at being sarcastic. But what's the point?
7010	Stewart’s style of humour is more sophisticated than that of Jon. He covers a wider range of issues and the special reporters he has are also better. The arrogant act he puts on can be irritating, but he’s also not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
7011	I think Stewart has a much more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has are great too. He also gets bonus points for being there first. Stephen relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
7012	When Jon Stewart comes to a comedy show, the audience laughs and that is called funny. When Stephen Colbert comes to a comedy show, the audience doesn't laugh and that is considered boring.
7013	His humour style is simple. However, he has a wide range of topics. There are interviews that are better than his other bits. His special reporters are good too. He always has good topics. He also gets bonus points for being the first to go to a situation.
7014	Jon Stewart has a more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues than David Letterman. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has are great too. He also has a better sense of humour than Letterman.
7015	Yes, say that you only get your news from "Fox News" and no where else, they put on wrong statements (such as labeling a congressional republican sexual predator as a democrat) and never make a correction. You now believe that the sexual predator was a democrat congressman, your reality has been altered. But that's just a factual reality and can be easily remedied, I suppose the question meant as in making a person schizophrenic or dillusional.

7020	This marks the first time I've EVER given a five-star review to any form of chain restaurant, but it's well warranted here.  I've visited this location four times since it opened, and even at the height of the "new food! everybody eat there!" furor, the staff was unfailingly polite and cheerful, the chicken was fresh and well-cooked, the biscuits were perfect and the dirty rice was great.  I've even tried the cajun tenders, and unlike most places where any form of boneless chicken has as much seasoning as the box in which it is delivered, the tenders here have some real kick.  Make sure you get the "mild" ones for the kiddos. I'm taking lunch to my son at school on Friday, and pondering picking up a big box o'bird to share with the teachers...

7025	One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix on decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning. The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then. The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom. You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.

7028	In point of view, some restaurants are super unfriendly, especially in hotels or during business trips. The food is not always healthy, but sometimes it's impossible to get healthy food at home. I have also had experience with some places where the food is very bland, lacked of flavor and the food is not fresh. I would not want to spend money on food that isn't the best.
7029	Bad news from the very beginning and more importantly greasy chips, margaritas straight sugar w/ no liquor and bland enchiladas and worst of all I got food poisoning. Also it looks like the hostess was super unfriendly. A terrible way to start off a meal! It's terrible! Well after spending 5 nights in the hospital, I hate to admit it but I also had a mild form of stress ulcer. I can't even imagine how a food poisoning would cause the same thing. I had to spend 2 days on a leeching machine to get rid of it and they are very expensive. I finally recovered and I have since been wary of Mexican food and avoid any and all Mexican restaurants at all costs. Luckily I didn't have any weird food poisoning that cause me to get symptoms for 2 weeks. Most of the signs have gone away except for the unexplained abdominal pain that I think is due to stress ulcer.
7030	This place only has NASTY ASS BURGERS. After I ordered, people were waiting for over 40 minutes and there plane was boarding, so they started yelling into the kitchen "JUST GIVE ME WHAT U GOT!"

7033	There is a place here that offers nasty ass burgers. After I ordered, the waitress told me the line would be long, but after 40 minutes she was getting ready to start the plane to go work and the line was still a long one. So she yelled in the kitchen "JUST GIVE ME WHAT U GOT!" That was when I realized I should have gone somewhere else. So I ordered the ruby burger I noticed that it had no cheese on it and the bottom of the burger was bad, so I only ate the bottom part. I felt like I was eating a card board burger! So nasty I didn't eat all the burger cause I paid for it and I was hungry. There were only fries, nothing special. I wanted to go to burger king originally, but the gate was closed to go there! Never going back here again!
7034	This place doesn't only have nasty burgers. The service is horrible and the gate is closed for customers to be able to enter.
7035	My husband and I came to celebrate his new position. We had impeccable service and our food was great. I had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo, while my husband enjoyed the shrimp and chicken alfredo. I chose to write this review because we also witnessed the staff accommodating a woman with a visual impairment. Her waitress literally read her the menu until she found something she wanted. Her waitress was patient and attentive.

7040	Our pizza was excellent and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back!
7041	Such a good pizza. We ordered Margherita and Diavola Pizza and both were spectacular. We have been to Naples and had pizza there and the pizza at Inizio is the closest we have been able to find in the US. The sauce is delicious!!! The restaurant is really well decorated and has a great atmosphere and we loved the tables. The staff was also super friendly. Loved every bit of it; we will definitely be back!

7045	If you don't do anything then your business will go under and you won't get your money. Its just a matter of how much money you need to get it going but good luck getting started.
7046	This place is not 5 stars, but with a few tweaks, it could be. I am giving it 5 stars so that the ranking on yelp doesn't go any lower. I hope management is reading these reviews as most people are spot on. Needs: better customer service training for your staff, better lighting for night time sports, additional seating. This stuff is easy, but will be the demise if not corrected.

7050	Jardin Panos is a Greek restaurant with a terrace. It's nothing special but it's a cute place to eat in the summer and an outdoor option to enjoy the dog-walking area and an ice-cream.   But it's a little pricey for the food that you get. Overall it's decent for the price though.   What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse, which is very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.
7051	The food at Jardin Panos is always consistently decent. If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is always consistently good.

7055	Their gay! Just because I am not gay doesn't mean the kids at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
7056	They really do like a gay lifestyle, actually this is just experience...I'm not gay but all the kids that are at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniform changes.
7057	Yeh they are just children, gay or straight... it doesn't matter what they are. This is just how they got along in the situation that they are in.
7058	Their gay! This is just an example of how the social pressure of school age puts pressure on kids to conform to a society's standards. Actually I'm not gay but all the kids that are at my high school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
7059	Their gay! They are just acting according to their experiences. I am not gay but all the kids that are at my h-school are trying to get a petition signed for uniforms.
7060	Another reason given against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. Stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity. It is even claimed that school uniforms restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.

7064	Uniforms in schools on principle can enable children to have a good socialization process but when children dress in uniforms daily there must be full recognition that an individuality must be sustained in the name of being seen as a member of the class.
7065	Kids don't want to wear the same clothes every day because they want to buy different clothes every day.
7066	Your children won't like the same clothes every day. I know that, I'd rather not have them dress alike.
7067	Kids wouldn't want to wear the same clothes every day, I know I would too.
7068	As a kid I hated it when my mom kept the same clothes every day.
7069	Kids don't want to wear the same clothes every day. I know I would hate it.
7070	in my opinion, I think school uniforms are not a good idea. Adults/teachers tell us to be ourselves and to express who we really are. But we can't do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!!

7073	In my personal opinion, I think that school uniforms are not a good idea because adults are always telling us to be ourselves and to express who we really are. But we cannot do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!
7074	For my own personal opinion, I think that school uniforms are not a good idea. Adults are always telling us to be our selves and to express who we really are. But we can't do that while wearing a stupid uniform to school!
7075	I don't think it's a good idea to keep restrictions because that's just going to make students, especially teens, more hungry for fashion. It's better to feed them than to keep them hungry. Once they're gone from these restrictions, we will see the other side of them, which is much worse with no morals. So allow people to be free with their personalities instead of stopping them.
7076	To restrict children’s fashion choices is an excellent idea since it makes it easier to feed them. However, letting them explore their personalities is a much worse idea.
7077	It is a bad idea to keep restrictions because it will make students especially teenagers more hungry for fashion. It's better to feed them than to keep them hungry. Once they are away from these restrictions, we will see other sides of them which is worse than having no morals. So allow people to be free with their personalities rather than stoping them.
7078	Again, the current student body should be allowed to be themselves and not controlled by restrictions on what they can wear and what they can eat. Freeing them up means that they can develop their own morals and personality, whereas restricting them means that they can't. Making free choices is much better than constantly curbing their free choices.
7079	Who are responsible for the cheap prices of clothing and other necessary things? Students (teenagers). We keep prices low because they live in a world of simple needs, where everything is cheap, and only clothes are expensive. So, even though they have nice clothes that we pay a high price for, they don't want to change that, because we sell them cheap clothes. But what if we pay more? What if we pay less, and put only clothes that they should buy? Why? I think this problem has little to do with clothes at all, but with the ideas that students buy. If they wanted to buy nice clothes for themselves, they'd buy them in stores. Once we buy clothes for them in shops, we teach them to always search for the best bargain. When it
7080	Firefox has nothing to do with apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy and I'd dislike your name.
7081	Firefox does NOT have to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I would say you're the fanatic zealot.
7082	Firefox is better than Mac OS X for security reasons because it uses a more reliable security model. It's a better user interface and it has many more features than Mac OS X.
7083	This is not a software issue. It's a fanatical zealot fanboy and believer of apple and Steve Jobs.
7084	Firefox has nothing to do with Apple or Steve Jobs. I'd say you're the fanatical zealot fanboy.
7085	Internet Explorer isn't as secure as Mozilla Firefox. It doesn't alert you that it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates the older version to the latest version along with a google toolbar and it downloads very slowly.
7086	Mozilla Firefox is better than Internet Explorer because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates the older version to the latest version along with a Google Toolbar and it downloads very quickly.
7087	Internet Explorer is better than Mozilla Firefox because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-up and automatically updates the older version to the latest version along with a google toolbar and it downloads very quickly
7088	Mozilla Firefox is better than Internet Explorer because it is more spyware and virus-free. It warns you that it has blocked pop-ups, and it automatically updates itself to the newest version along with the google toolbar and it downloads very quickly
7089	Firefox is better than Internet Explorer because it alerts you that it has blocked pop-ups and automatically updates the older version to the latest version along with a google toolbar and it downloads very quickly.
7090	More than Firefox. And probably more; IE could spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances and use them as a blind.
7091	Internet Explorer is buggy and uses a lot of memory when you open more than one tab. Firefox is better because it doesn't spawn multiple instances of its SVCHOST.exe blind.
7092	Internet Explorer is faster than Firefox because it uses less memory and doesn’t spawn multiple SVCHOST.exe instances. It could spawn more instances if you load more than two tabs.
7093	Internet Explorer is extremely buggy and causes Windows to be slower. Also, it could spawn multiple instances of itself and use them as a blind.
7094	IE isnt the perfect version, but i dont think that it's using much more than v 6 or 7 on windows, and even on Vista i prefer the less functional version of Firefox 3 over IE, one of the least functional gadgets that they had up there for soooo long.
7095	Spouses shouldn't talk to each other on this type of topic, and if they start asking some questions on their own, take them out before they turn you in.
7096	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate is "DON'T CONFIDENCE in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody. They'll turn you in. And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!"
7097	Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!
7098	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Do not confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!"

7100	While there are benefits to watching TV, I think reading books is better overall for learning as they require more focus.
7101	There are some benefits to TV, but I think books are better overall. They require more focus, I think, making them more educational.
7102	TV can be an important aspect in our education, but the benefits of books are far greater. Also, it's more focused and require more attention
7103	Overall books are better than TV for learning as they require more focus.
7104	Reading is much more beneficial. It not only allows you to understand what you are reading about but also helps you learn to critically think and to distinguish what's good and what's bad.
7105	Television is almost the same as books, the only difference is, you actually have to move your eyes for books.
7106	TV is the same thing as books. The only difference is that it actually has to move your eyes for books
7107	Television is almost the same thing as books, the only difference is that it actually has to move your eyes for books
7108	On this side of the mirror is tv because only TV can bring you live news. Books you can't find also.
7109	Although books are more intellectual, television is slightly better because you have to actually move your eyes for books.
7110	It should be when a U.S. soldier walks into your neighborhood, you can still yell, "The red coats are coming. The red coats are coming." If the India ever tried to take over the US, the US would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming. The red dots are coming."
7111	There is no need to yell red coats or red dots when the U.S. is going to take over an unarmed India or Pakistan. Be helpful and try not to embarrass our nations. Let us both live in peace, while we fight over petty issues.
7112	When the U.S. fought the Brits for their independence, the Brits wore a red uniform. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." If India ever tried to take over the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming." ;)
7113	When the United States fought the British to get independence, the British wore a red uniform. Whenever Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell "The Red Coats are Coming, the Red Coats are Coming."

7115	Being a fatherless person would be better than having a uncaring lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
7116	I agree that a fatherless person is more likely to do badly in life, but he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to. I don't think he has to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
7117	It is better not to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose not to be fathered rather than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
7118	My point is, having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
7119	It's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father over having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
7120	If I look up at a lousy father, I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
7121	Being a fatherless person would be better than having a lousy father because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
7122	If I have a "lousy father" I would rather be "fatherless" instead of having a "lousy father" because a father is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example to the rest of the family. So if I have a lousy father I might be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up to be the man of the house especially if I have younger brothers or sisters.
7123	I would rather be fatherless then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
7124	With no father, I would rather be "fatherless" rather than having a "lousy father" because it sets a good example for the rest of the family to look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father, I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father, I'll set the standards for my own self and up step and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers and sisters.
7125	Being without a father figure doesn't have to be a bad thing either way you still lose out. Having a father figure in your life can teach you a lot of valuable lessons that you can take with you when you grow up. If you were to have a bad father figure then you should at least not have a father as you don't want a reason for thinking negative thoughts. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy one.
7126	Its better to have no father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure. Either way you are going to lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you have a lousy father than there is no point of having a father figure in your life. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy one.
7127	Its always better to have a respectable father figure in your life than to have a lousy father figure.
7128	In the end, no matter if you had a father or not you still lose when a father is a lousy father. If you had a father you'd want him to be the best he could be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a father who was just lousy then what's the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a good respectable father figure then to have a lousy father figure.
7129	Being a respectable father is always better than having a lousy father. If you had a lousy father he wouldn't teach you anything. So its always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.

7140	For the believers of Evolution, if you say that Evolution is true and that man kind is currently not evolving, then you are not really believing the facts. In fact, you are looking at Evolution as a process and taking an opposite view. People of different race and tribe and culture have evolved, in order to survive on our planet. Human race has gradually divided into new culture and new people for the purpose of survival.
7141	Evolution is true and mankind is currently not evolving. And how is it (for those of you who have religion), that Adam and Eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? In Arabic mankind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of Adam.
7142	how is it that evolution is true, and man is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you who HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in the B.A.N.I.A.M.S.?! How did they not see that the BIG SPACE ONE couldn't have the B.A.N.I.A.M.S. ONLY! or make us B.I.G.!
7143	In a story of evolution, man is evolving. That is the current evidence. In a story about mankind, man is their first member. That is the current evidence. In a story of mankind, man were created by god, by evolution, or by some combination. If the story of mankind includes god, only then is it a story of religious belief.
7144	It is true that evolution is true and mankind is currently not evolving. Adam and Eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the parents of mankind. In Arabic makind is the word for the tribe of Adam.
7145	IE is more sleek then firefox, however the bookmark thing can be easier if it's using the firefox add-on.
7146	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer Internet Explorer because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using Firefox though, because I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
7147	Quick And Dirty Response: Highlight the bookmark and don't delete.
7148	Internet Explorer from a casual Internet user is superior because it has a sleeker design and I find bookmark/history easier. I'm using FireFox though, because I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
7149	This really means that any user can install any add-on, and one can install ad-blocking filters in IE too. Because we can't manage that, we should go for IE.
7150	Since kids are fat these days, PE helps. It'll help them realize health is important for their lame ass futures. LOL
7151	If the teacher was a little bit fitter, maybe they could encourage the kids to take care of their health... and take care of their skeletal system that has been slipping since forever.
7152	Kids are fat these days because the caloric value of food on the market is too high. PE helps the children to realize health is important for their lame ass futures.
7153	Our kids are fat because PE doesn't help. It seems to be ignored today. If the health officers can find some reasonably healthy people to go out and teach kids how to live a healthy life, I think that would be the best way to get people to realize that health is important for their lame ass futures lol
7154	Most kids in the fast food world are fat because fast food is preferred by the kids. P.E. helps the health of your kids as well as it helps them realize heath is important for their lame ass futures. lol
7155	Mandatory school breakfast and snacks could be a good idea because kids will not eat to much at their meals and will get enough physical exercise.
7156	It should be mandatory because kids look at the streets and see kids playing and they are most likely overweight because they eat too much and don't get enough physical exercise.
7157	It is manditory for kids to exercise and not to eat too much food because overweight will lead to laziness and bad habits such as smoking, drinking, gambling, having sex, smoking and too many drugs.
7158	I think it definatley should be manditory, when you look at the streets at kids playing they are most likley over weight because they eat too much and don't get enough physical exercise.
7159	Mandatory school lunches have proven to be effective in improving school readiness and can save the U.S. economy an estimated $50 billion a year.
7160	Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore but Raffles only dreamt about what to do.

7170	What? You don't like feminist causes? No wonder some men will be so scared to talk to some of these "feminist nuts" women. Good on you.
7171	You do not know these girl's/women's stories who are you to judge what they can or cannot do, until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.

7174	It doesn't matter if a girl or woman wants to do X, as long as she isn't still a minor. At least that isn't the case in this country where late teens/younger still "occupy" their own legally.
7175	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution
7176	There is definitely natural selection happening. Fruit flies are very useful for this experiment because they breed and die quickly. You can actually see evolution happening. One type of fruit fly is not as'useful' as the other types since they live and die so quickly, but that's just the difference in them that have made it to become advantageous to that species, rather then the others.

7180	Creation seems less likely than evolution to be affected by chance.
7181	We were created in about six to ten days. It seems that this concept might have come from the Bible's account of creation and is also used in the book of Genesis. The nine days of creation happen to parallel the nine days of Moses' wandering in the desert. In the garden of Eden, the accounts describe a god or an angel visiting
7182	Were we magically created in a few days or our evolution was processed throughout billions of years? Which is more realistic? Which was more likely to happen?
7183	We are created by God. Which made it a more realistic scenario because the creation process would have been more difficult to explain to people, so God worked to bring us into existence, which was easier.
7184	Which is more realistic? The creating of us through evolution or through miracle? Which is more likely to happen?
7185	Think about it, it's impossible for evolution to NOT happen. The weak die, the strong continue to breed. This strengthens the species. Argument over. However, creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. I don't believe in a God simply because of the unbelievably minute chance of a God (or gods) existing.

7190	Whatever porn is, is a way of life that is shameful. I bet all of the people on the Yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins.
7191	We're promoting sex and any child pornography is a particularly vile form of it.
7192	Whatever, porn is a f**king way of life. I bet you any money that all the people on the Yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins.
7193	Whatever porn is a f**king way of life. i bet every virgin that ALL the people on the Yes argument that make porn wrong are virgins. 
7194	Whatever'sexy' is, Porn is a WASTE of time that can only be caused by financial stress.
7195	No pornography is not wrong. Maybe some people think it is wrong but really it is not. Come on if their was no pornography and sex how would we have babies?
7196	No porn is not wrong. Maybe some people think it is wrong but really it is not. Come if there was no porn and sex how would we have babies.
7197	No pornography is not wrong. Maybe some people think it's wrong but really it is not. Come if there was no pornography and sex how would we have babies?
7198	There is no need to suppress any sexuality. If there were no porn, sex, relationships or anything, how could we have children?
7199	No pornography is wrong. Maybe some people think it is wrong, but actually it is not. Would you have babies if there was no pornography and sex?
7200	Good deeds aren't just for those who are self-centered. There are those who want to help others. However, a personal pursuit is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The good deeds happen for some, like a loan for college, a charity for an orphanage, school, etc
7201	Defending your rights and providing your parent with adequate care is a good deed to be done for the Common good even if the action in itself is not for your own benefit. If you lend a hand to someone in need and the person in need is in love with you and you later get married, there's an excellent chance for you to get financial compensation. This supports your family, provides for the basic needs of your children, and invests in your future.
7202	For example, there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit, however, is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
7203	Advancing the common good is a better endeavor than personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
7204	Advancing the common good is a better effort than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however, is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc.
7205	Improving the common good is better because it will benefit your community. But improving your own life is better because if you don't go to college after high school then you won't go at all. So you'd choose the personal pursuit.
7206	(advancing the common good is better) because it is helping out the community. But (personal pursuit) will be better because I know that if I don't go to college after high school then I won't go at all so I would choose my personal pursuit.
7207	It may be better to advance the common good because it helps the community. But it may be better to pursue personal gain because I know that if I don't go to college after high school, then I won't go to college at all. So I would choose my personal gain.
7208	Advancing the common good is better because it helps the community. But personal pursuit will be better because I know if I don't go to college after high school I won't go at all so I would choose my personal pursuit.
7209	As a teen, I should be doing my homework to become a better person. A college education helps to get ahead. My college education means that I will make better decisions in the future.
7210	There are some people that are greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe every has small feelings towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
7211	I believe in advancing toward the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
7212	I've heard about the common good. But I don't think it does really exist in this world. Most people are greedy and selfish and only care about what they want. I don't think most people have any feeling towards the common good. Most people think they are important than everyone else in the whole world.
7213	I believe it's better to advance towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone has small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
7214	People believe in more than they truly believe, they want to stay popular and care about what the people think of them, and usually, who they are not to care about what others think of them. They believe they are special and important to everyone, and they think that others don't care about them.
7215	In my opinion, it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it is a leveler- it prevents people from showing off material wealth/it makes others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff but it can be taken too far. At the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiocy
7216	With a uniform, it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed to wear coloured socks, which was idiotic.
7217	It is good to some extent. I went to a school that had uniforms, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it is a leveler. It prevents people from showing off their material wealth and making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was stupid.

7220	If you are following school rules and expressing emotions is your right, but not necessary as we have come to school for learning.
7221	School code and right to express emotions are good, but it isn't necessary to go to school to learn.
7222	It is good to follow school code because it is important for school success. It is right to express emotions to people we love. But it is not necessary as we have come to school to learn.
7223	In a school, it's important to follow the proper school code, and the right to express emotions is right but not necessary.
7224	The right to express emotions is perfectly fine. It's important that you keep to school code.
7225	Uniforms are good. In schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning and you don't have to go on shopping trips so regularly.

7229	I believe that uniforms are good. It takes the unnecessary steps to put on a new outfit every morning. Also, when the classroom is not that crowded you do not have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear that day. In this situation, you will get the full attention you deserve. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but you don't have to go shopping so regularly. 
7230	Uniforms don't bring equality on an economic level. It can be prevent envy and jealousy.
7231	Uniforms can prevent envy and jealousy. Students should be equal on an economic level. To prevent envy and jealousy, students should be allowed to wear whatever they like.
7232	Uniforms make students equal on an economic level This can be prevented envy and jealousy.
7233	It is a good idea for students to be equal on an economic level, as uniforms prevent jealousy and envy.
7234	Uniforms allow students equal on an economic level. This can be prevented from envy and jealousy.
7235	Being a fatherless person is hard. If you need help, at least you have your dad to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.
7236	Having a lousy father would be better than being fatherless. If you have a lousy father, you can look at his mistakes, and avoid them. Also being fatherless would be hard on you and your mom. You would have no example or any kind of person to look up to. If you need help, at least you have your father there to lend you a hand, even if he is lousy.

7240	Being fatherless is not as nice as having a lousy father. You don't really know the guy until he is gone and never coming back.
7241	To have a lousy father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you have it until he is gone and never coming back.
7242	In fact, I am not fatherless because I have a father. I am fatherless because not everyone has a father. For some people fatherhood is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.

For some people, to have a poor father is like having no father. But in reality you don't really know how good your father is or how good you really have it until he is gone and never coming back.
7245	The construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems are expensive, wasteful, and distract from the brass ring of public health: the drilling of wells.
7246	It's costly, wasteful and distracts the attention away from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.
7247	This is a costly and wasteful policy, which only measures the symptoms of the problem. It can only be used in conjunction with other measures to try to improve the quality of the water.
7248	It's costly, wasteful and unpopular. It distracts from the brass ring of public health: the construction and maintenance of safe municipal water systems.

7250	Water bottles are bad. Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution and some people sell water battles that have bacteria in them. Also, they're expensive. Water systems are aging and they leave hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.
7251	Water bottles are bad. They cause pollution. Also some people sell water battles with bacteria in it depending on where you get the water. Water bottles also cost more than tap water. Water systems are aging and over time there are hundreds of chemical contaminants in the water.

7253	Water bottles are bad because they cause pollution. Tap water is much safer. Bacteria could occur in the water tanks where water used. A lot of chemicals, like, chlorine or chemicals in the water come from the water tank maintenance systems.

7255	As kids, TV has been very useful for debating topics. If you could help the debate or have a topic that interests you and say something to your school class it might be very effective.
7256	Can people say some points on how TV is better than books because at our school we are doing a debate and we need some help
7257	Yes, it is! People can say their points on TV is better than books because TV is better than books.
7258	People can say that on TV is better than books because at our school we are doing a debate that can you please help?!?!
7259	Many people think that TV is better than books because at our school we're doing a debate, and you can tell your opinion. Please help.
7260	Why would we ban a product that more than a million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession?
7261	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
7262	Why would we ban a product that almost 2 million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession?
7263	Because we are in a recession and water is a necessity. Banning water bottles is a costly or unpopular policy that can only be implemented when the economy is doing well.
7264	We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession! Why would we ban a product that more than a million people buy when we are in the middle of a recession?

7270	When I'm at the beach on a hot summers day and I'm getting dehydrated and my only option for water is the ocean that I wouldn't drink from I have two options, pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick/in the hospital or drink out of a WATER BOTTLE
7271	Yes. Water bottles are convenient to me. What happens when I'm at the beach on a hot summer day and I'm getting all dehydrated and my only option for water is the ocean that I wouldn t drink from. I have two options: pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of my day sick/in the hospital or drink out of a WATER BOTTLE.
7272	Drinking out of a water bottle is not a convenient option. There are better alternatives for drinking when you're outdoors in the heat like a large water container that fits under your hat like a large pocket water cooler or you can get a water filter.
7273	Passing out from the heat and lack of water is a disgusting option because you just waste the rest of your day sick/in the hospital and you can use money or time to sit and have a better day.
7274	People drink water bottles because they are convenient. What happens when they are tired and dehydrated and they can't get any water, they can pass out from the heat and lack of water and waste the rest of their day sick/in the hospital.

7276	Last comment was put on the wrong side. My bad.
7277	Do you think the last comment was put on the wrong side?
7278	Last comment was put on the wrong side. I'm sorry for that.
7279	It was put on the wrong side, I apologize.
7280	Of course its wrong. Why do you think Aids exists?
7281	Of course it's wrong. Why do you think AIDS exists?
7282	Of course AIDS exists. Why? In this particular case I would say it is because of improper use of condoms because it's a
7283	Why do you think AIDS exists?
7284	The answer isn’t really clear. Aids is an illness that kills people, and there is nothing sexiest about it.
7285	Is marriage really just about "love"? I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love", I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle school and married couples could get married as well. It's not only about love.
7286	It is more than just about "love". It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. It is not only about love.
7287	Yes, marriage is only about legal rights, but it is about the two people involved. Therefore, it is also about families, generations, example, commitment and tax breaks. If it were only about love, then my dog and two kids could marry at the local middle school as well. It is not only about love.
7288	Can you think of any situations in your life where your love for someone is more important than your love for society?
7289	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, commitment, example, tax breaks, parental roles. If it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well. It's not about love.
7290	Or do you mean that Gay-sex is helping spread AIDS. In which case Gay-marriage may help reduce the problem. What is 'gay-sex? I think (and this is a wild guess) that the original argument the person was attempting to make was that UNPROTECTED ANAL sex can increase the liklihood of AIDS transmission. That might be true. But if it is, it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
7291	Not at all, it's just that some people, in an effort to get children of their own, have been mixing their sperm and eggs. Those who claim to do so are very well informed and understanding of the risks of mixed unions.
7292	This is a wild guess. Let me explain. I think that the original argument that the person was attempting to make is that unprotected anal sex can increase the chance of AIDS transmission. That might be true but if it is then it really has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the two people involved.
7293	Transmission in any way is harmful to others and should not be tolerated.
7294	If I understood it correctly, you meant that the spread of AIDS is increased because people are having anal sex without using condoms; if that is the case then no, I can't see why gay marriage will increase the spread of AIDS.
7295	Discrimination laws based on personal preference are legal but just as bad as laws based on personal preference are illegal.
7296	Separate but equal means that men and women should be given equal political rights and not have gender discrimination on employment, education, housing, and other grounds. Most laws violating this principle are the ones specifically requiring specific sex roles. A law requiring separate schools and public accommodations for homosexual people would violate "distinct and different." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship would also be a violation of this principle.
7297	So why do feminists confuse non-violent direct action with military force? Also, if everyone was obligated to marry only someone of the same gender to prevent "bisexual" love relationships, that doesn't mean there would only be heterosexual love relationships.
7298	The law should contemplate man/woman relationships in a way that it recognizes that man/woman relationships do not have identical implications as man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them.
7299	Based on what I understand, the separation and distinctness between relationships between men and women and relationships between men and men are very different. If the law is to contemplate intelligently relationships between men and women, it has to be able to isolate them, in order to ensure their distinction and their integrity.
7300	Yes, India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur, while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. For example, Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon.

7305	I'm not religious and religious doesn't mean you have to be an atheist. God isn't Christian.
7306	If the description of this argument was the qualifying factor, then yes I would be more religious, because according to the Bible, God is definitely not Christian.
7307	Being an atheist is the most rational thing to do because if God were Christian, He would be obsessed with Jesus.
7308	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I'm going with Atheism. God isn't Christian.
7309	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I'm going with Atheism. God isn't Christian.
7310	If God loves everyone, does that mean He hates gays and the Bible is just a book, have you ever wondered that one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "God" look good in the translation?
7311	God loves everyone and does not hate homosexuals, or the bible is just a book. Have you ever wondered if the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good?
7312	If God loves everyone, why does He hate gays and the Bible is just a book, have you ever wondered that the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make God look good?
7313	If God loves everyone, then why does he hate gays and hate the Bible? Have you ever wondered that the one Cardinal who translated the Bible changed some things to make "God" look good?
7314	If God loves all, why would he hate gays or any group? Why are other religions not accepted in this country? Why is this country unjust? Why do the laws and laws change year after year? Why do you think adults die of disease and not the harsh punishment that they deserve? How does the govt work? Why is it illegal to steal a hamburger from a gas station? Why are
7315	After an expiation you should not do it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worse.
7316	After being spanked I make sure I never do it again to avoid being punished. The second time is always worse because you have already been warned that you will be punished.
7317	After a spanking I make sure I never do it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worse because you were told not to already.
7318	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again because the second time is always worst.
7319	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again because the second time is always worse.
7320	Parents should have the choice to use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
7321	Parents should use spanking as a discipline option but there's also a limit to everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
7322	There is a limit to what the parents can do. However, they shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline the kids.
7323	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but there is also a limit for everything. So they shouldn't use spanking every time the children do something wrong.
7324	Parents should use spanking as a possible option to discipline their kids but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
7325	The debate between secularism and Christianity has been heated up over time. It would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
7326	Religion is no good, but it makes no sense to say that you shouldn't try to persecute people.
7327	The trend of atheism has not really gained ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
7328	This trend of atheism has not gained that much ground and it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
7329	Personally, I would say, as this argument has heated up, it's better to conclude that this trend of atheism has not really gained much ground. But it would be anomalous to conceal our religion and say we support atheism.
7330	You rather die believing in God, than not believing and finding out He exists.
7331	Much better to die believing in God than to live without faith and then having to discover there is a God.
7332	You rather die believing in God than not believing and finding out he exists!
7333	You are better off believing in God than living without belief and discovering how real he exists.
7334	You rather die believing in god, than not believing and finding out he exists!
7335	Spanking is mostly out of anger that can be for more then what your kid has done like if some other person made him/her mad that he/she has let it all out on the child.
7336	Because spanking is usually out of anger and can be for more than what your kid did like if some other person made him mad, it lets it all out on him.
7337	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more reasons than what your child had done, like if someone else made them mad, they would let all that anger out on them.
7338	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid did like if some one else made him mad, he allowed it to all out on him. Ths isn't right but what is right. Spanking is a way for parents to bring to light a behavior that makes you mad.
7339	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad thy let it all out on him
7340	I think parents should not spank because there is a way to make them behave without spanking.
7341	I think parents should not spank, because there is other way to make their behavior good.
7342	One way of causing a child to behave is not spanking. You should get into the minds of the child and try to change his thought and his actions.
7343	So there should be no argument if parents must spank because there are other ways to discipline.
7344	Parents should not spank because there are other ways to make them behave, such as explain, discipline, etc.
7345	By defending spanking or showing sympathy towards spankings, a parent actually teaches their child that abusive behavior is acceptable. That is not the same as saying that everyone should use it. It doesn't make spankings a better idea, but it does make all parents more accountable for the behavior of their children, so maybe less will be spanked.
7346	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
7347	Spanking has not been shown to have anything to do with how a child develops into an adult, as far as I know. However, I can think of many children that were spanked growing up who became terrible adults and children that were not spanked growing up who became good or even great adults.
7348	Spanking is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
7349	Spanking is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.
7350	This does make sense. You hit someone, then you get hit by that same person. You get told not to hit someone, then told not to hit, then hit by the same person.
7351	Does it make sense to steal a candy bar from school and then your parents steal your favorite toy? I don't think it does. Yes, it would make sense if the person who stole a candy bar from school was punished for doing so and not your parents. So your parents are punished for having a kid who stole a candy bar from school, which is totally a different situation.
7352	Hit, hit. Get hit. Hit. Get hit. Why did we have to get hit and punished for something that we didn't do and that they didn't make us do?
7353	Does this make sense? You steal a candy bar from school, then your parents steal your favorite toy. You stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. Does the situation look the same for hitting someone? You hit someone, they get hit, and you are told not to hit someone, then told not to hit, then hit the same person.
7354	Does this make sense: You steal a candy bar from school and your parents steal your favorite toy. You stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. Ah, same thing applies to this. You hit someone and you get hit. You get told not to hit someone and then told not to hit, then hit by the same person
7355	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill someone? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
7356	Alright, here's my reasoning for killing people. If it's a pet of yours, it belongs to you. If you feel it's causing you trouble, it's your responsibility to protect it. The law protects animals and gives people like that a bit of compassion. I would not kill that pet, but I would definitely turn it in to the authorities. If that pet has caused or harmed anyone, that is solely the responsibility of the person who let it loose in the first place. Whoever did it shall be punished for their crime, regardless of who they are to me, or what they mean to me, and I would definitely turn them in, but I would also help those who were injured. Whoever helped them or didn't help them, would also have to go
7357	If I was teaching in school and one of my students was molested by a teacher, I would turn him/her in. If you help that person, you may also go to jail.
7358	That person should be punished for the crime whether he is innocent or not. I don't care who you are, what you mean to me or if you help them or not. I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime, and I am not going to jail.
7359	I'd turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me. I'd definitely turn you in if you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
7360	If the person you loved and lived with murdered someone, then yes, you would definitely turn him/her in. Murder is premeditated and intentional and it's never too late to turn someone in for murder.
7361	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone I would definitely turn them in. Murder is intentional and premeditated so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
7362	If the person I loved and lived with murdered someone, then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
7363	To be honest, if a friend or loved one is acting unexpectedly, the person might have murdered someone, then you should confront them and report them to the police. Someone being murderer never shows any signs and once you act on your suspicions the person might end up killing you.
7364	The person who your loved and lived with committed a crime, and if you had a conflicting moral view then I would certainly turn them in, murder is premeditated and intentional, so there is a possibility of them later on turning on you.
7365	These actions are wrong, you could have been an accident, but still, it's wrong to kill. The police are going to find out who killed that person, but I don't want my wife to leave me for a long period of time, so I would tell. But then again, I wouldn't
7366	Among other things, it is wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want my wife to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell her but then again i wouldn't.
7367	It is wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong. The police will find out who did it, but I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time. I would tell the police, but then again I wouldn't.
7368	In fact, it shouldn't be that interesting. Only in the beginning, because it takes time for the police to find out who killed the person. However, I wouldn't turn in my wife because it is wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides the police will definitely find out who killed that person, but I wouldn't want her to leave me for a long period of time, so I would tell the police, but then again I wouldn't.
7369	If the police would investigate it, there is a chance that they would find out who killed the person, but I don't want my wife to leave me for a long period of time so I would tell the police but then again I wouldn't.
7370	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, the individual who is always involved in the murderer and/ or is an accomplice is always caught. I don't want to be the accomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.
7371	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the person always involved with the murderer or is an accomplice is always caught. I don't want to be the accomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so I would break up with her.

I don't want to be the accomplice and to be caught. Also, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.
7373	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files the individual that is always caught is always involved with the murderer and is an acomplice. I don't want to be an accomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.
7374	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files, the person who is always involved with the murderer and or is an accomplice is always caught. I don't want to be the accomplice and be caught. Plus, if my wife killed someone, she would be too crazy for me. So therefore I would break up with her.
7375	If my husband were to murder someone else, then his next attack would probably be on me. So the likelihood is greater that he might kill me than I would commit murder. He is definitely a messed up person. Therefore, I don't want to marry someone who committed murder.
7376	It is very unlikley for a husband to commit murder and also, if his next attack is on his wife, its very unlikley that he will die in it. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and thats not who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
7377	In this case I would probably file a police report because he is not who I wanted to marry, and if he kills someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Of course he is madly in love with someone else so why does he get to shoot and kill innocent people? That's not who I want to marry!
7378	If I was to break up with him and live with another man, who knows if he would murder the next person he attacked. Obviously he is messed up in his head. If I had a choice between a murderer and a normal person, I'd choose a normal person
7379	In most cases, we would definitely turn him in if we suspect he killed his own sister. Also, since the criminals are mentally ill, who knows if his next attack will be on us. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and that is not who we want to spend the rest of our lives with.
7380	Let kids get bullied in PE because it's their right to bulldoze other kids in PE. Bullies pick their victims each day in PE so all you guys on the affirmative team are WRONG!
7381	Boys must not be forced to do sports because only sports can bring them physical activity, which can only reduce obesity. Bullies pick their victims every day at school, so all of you on the affirmative team are wrong.
7382	Sport should not be compulsory. So men kids get bullied in school because they are fatter then others or more unfit. Bullies pick there victims each day in school so all u guys on the affirmative team are WRONG!
7383	The only reason people play sports is so they can bully other people. Kids that are fatter than the rest of their class are bullied. Bullies pick their victims each day in school. So all the guys on the affirmative team are wrong.
7384	In addition to supporting it, parents and adults should not be required to school their children with it. So, man kids get bullied in PE because they are too fat or too unfit! BULLIES pick their victims each day in PE and if all the positive team on the affirmative side of the debate were wrong, they would ban PE altogether.
7385	In fact, it's only obese kids who don't help in anything.
7386	I'm in school and PE doesn't make me happy. Many people get sad because they don't have the skills to be chosen for the team or team lead and they cannot play. I also suck at PE and it makes me a loser because I don't help my team and I am always the last one to be chosen for the teams. There are so many obese adults who have done PE and weren't help in anything.
7387	I'm in school, P.E. is terrible. Most people get sad because they are chosen last. They can't play for example, I suck at P.E. class. I hate it. I always the last one to be chosen for the teams. It's not cool. It's not just obese kids there are many obese adults who did P.E. and didn't helped in anything.
7388	For all I know, kids are happy in a variety of sports that aren’t PE. I just don’t see why PE has to be boring and/or be obnoxiously competitive. If your child wants to practice baseball or be the captain of a football team, the money will definitely cover it. What’s worse than being out of shape? How will a kid who doesn’t eat when she practices make her team look even if she’s the best of her class? I would rather see kids who have fun (and are actually good at sports!) than kids who take sports seriously and turn out miserable and/or obese.
7389	I'm in school and PE just makes kids unhappy,a lot of people get sad because they are chosen last,they can't play for example I suck at PE class I hate I'm always the last to be chosen for the teams and it's not cool and it's not just obese kids there are many obese adults who did PE and didn't helped in anything
7390	In 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be more beneficial by studying.
7391	The purpose of Physical Education is to provide students with a broad, well-rounded education that develops physical fitness, physical skills and an appreciation for and practice of teamwork, as well as team spirit. 8th graders have a lot on their plate, and they need time to focus on their studies.
7392	If students want to participate, then so be it. However, 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
7393	PE should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
7394	Although recess should be optional in 8th grade, if students want to participate in recess they should be allowed to do so. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on, and that time may be more beneficially used by studying.
7395	What matters the most is not the length but what is said in the minimum limit of 50 characters. So basically, no matter how dumb an argument is, it doesn't matter as long as it is at least 50 characters.
7396	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
7397	The purpose of the 50 character minimum is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes and kept quality of debate and discourse high.
7398	I like the length of an argument. I think it's better to make a short but effective argument than one long but weak one. The purpose of the 50-character minimum limit is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
7399	Minimum argument length is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes. We can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
7400	It is simply too tiring. Simply, so that is the reason why physical education should not be compulsory. The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
7401	It's too tiring to go to school every day. That's why physical education isn't compulsory.

The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
7403	Limiting the length of arguments is a dumb policy because limiting something can never be made mandatory. The purpose of the restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes so we can keep the quality of debate high.
7404	It's simply too tiring to have to continually provide grounds for rationalization of stupid beliefs in an argument, so I believe the minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. This restriction is meant to keep silly argumentation from being accepted.
7405	Some children simply cannot take physical education, 4 example, some are already in sports and they are always training like crazy.
7406	Some children simply cannot take pe. I mean some are already in athletics and they are constantly training like crazy.
7407	Some children do not take precautions in such a condition. Four example, some kids are already in sports and they are already training like crazy.
7408	Some children just can't take physical education, for example some are already in athletics and they are already training like crazy.
7409	Some children can't take PE because of the way they run. 4 example, some are already in athletic and are already training like crazy.
7410	I'm not pleased with the idea that P.E. is required in college. First, I think that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. I believe that students have the responsibility to choose whether or not to work out. Also, I say that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirements in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. I adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. I goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.
7411	What? I don't think college has the right to tell students how to exercise. I believe they have the right to choose whether to exercise or not. For me, the purpose of the college is to train our brain not our body. I do not think that there should be any P.E. requirement. I would rather exercise at home. I would go hiking and play basketball in my neighborhood.
7412	I'm not pleased with the idea to increase PE requirements. First, I think that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise.

7415	Personal pursuit is better. It is easier to help yourself than to help others, plus not all people want to be helped. A person’s needs are more important than the needs of others, you have to do your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
7416	Personal pursuit is a good thing because it helps you get by on your own and you can help others if you so choose. The people who don't need help don't need to help, it just doesn't bring any happiness. That's why it is important to live your own life, not other peoples.
7417	Personal interests, however, are better because it's easier to help yourself than it is to help others. Also, not all people want to be helped. A person's need is more important than others need. You should take first priority to your personal pursuits. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
7418	Having your own personal pursuits first and helping others in the least possible time is more important than helping others first and having personal pursuits second. In this world, you have to fight for what you want.
7419	Personal pursuit is better because it is easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Also, not all people want to be helped. Your personal pursuit is more important then others need. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
7420	If you are not helping yourself, you can't help others. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture, if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power, you can help the people who matter to you.
7421	Remember that in the big picture if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
7422	In the big picture, if you pursue your dreams and achieve riches, fame, and power, you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
7423	If you try to help everyone that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong, helping people is always right. In the big picture, if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power, you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
7424	Personally, I think that if you are not helping yourself you can't help no one else. If you try to help everyone that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursue your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
7425	Personal pursuit. Human nature is to pursue things for themselves not for others.
7426	I believe personal persuit because human nature is to pursue things for themselves, not for others.
7427	Personal pursuit. Human nature is for someone to pursue things for themselves.
7428	Our world is just a game for people to use as a means to get what they need from other people.
7429	 I believe that personal pursuit is good for people. Human nature is for someone to pursue things for themselves, not for others.
7430	The person who threw the cup away is immediately out of the situation. The person who helped to roll the cup down shouldn't have to stand on his or her leg, except for the agreement between the finder and the keeper of the cup. If your neighbor asked you for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets, then you should pay a half for it. That's because if I asked you to pay me half of your reward, you would not get any for it.
7431	The person who threw the cup away is out immediately... The person who helped roll the cup rim down shouldn't have a leg to stand on, unless there was an agreement made by the finder of the cup. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigars, and a lottery ticket, I wouldn't ask for any reward, because he wouldn't get half of them. So I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
7432	I would expect my neighbor to follow the same general principles. I would not expect my neighbor to take the prize, and, moreover, I would not expect my neighbor to take advantage of me if I happened to be helping him and I don't expect my neighbor to ask for a ride when he could have gotten there on his own. However, if my neighbor did the actions that you describe in your theory, I would expect the neighbor to take half of the prize.
7433	The person who threw the cup away is out immediately. The person who helped roll the cup rim down shouldn't have a leg to stand on. Unless there was an agreement made by the finder of the cup. If your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets, you shouldn't get half the winnings. No. I would say the finder deserves the prize.
7434	Although your neighbor asked for a ride to the local gas station to buy beer, cigarettes, and a lottery ticket, you don't deserve half of the winnings. So I would have to say the finder deserves the prize.
7435	For example, your father's house was built in 1958, but his remains were just found in 2010. The state of Ohio can assist you with finding options on how to pay for his coffin.
7436	TV is better than books because it can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it is educational.
7437	Look, this is what you need to do. Try and get the money. The hospital bills can be paid in full by the hospitals billing department, all you need to do is put a statement in writing stating you can not pay the bill and most hospitals have to clear the account. Thats most hospitals,,,not all will. But its worth it. If you have no means to pay for it, then you dont. My father just passed away and he had not a potty to even use, and I thought once I went to the showing they would try and get me..well they didnt, cause most states (if you look into it more) will grant you so much to lay them in the ground. My state here in Ohio gave my father $6000.00 for his..they have to do something with the funds for tax write off reasons. So call Leagle Aide in your state and see what they tell you.
7438	Once you pay the bill, the hospital will pay it in full. It doesnt take much effort at all and most hospitals have to pay you their bill once they know your full intention.
7439	Now, this is something you need to know. Hospitals billing departments take care of the payments. So, to pay a bill by postal money order, just write the hospital in a letter stating that you are in the same boat and you need help dealing with medical bills, the money order sent to the hospital. If you have no money, they should clear your account, but its unlikely, as a lot of hospitals are less than trust worthy. So just try and get on their good side and tell them that the money is needed for something more important.
7440	Jesus was a Christian and he taught forgiveness to his followers.  It is not unethical to sue for damages if you are only in it for exact compensation and not greed.
7441	Being a Christian means forgiveness. It does not mean suffering in the punishment of others. If you do plan to sue you can sue for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if you only plan to sue for the exact amount in compensation and not for greed.
7442	If you plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income.  You are entitled to that amount.  Make sure you have receipts for everything.  It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.
7443	If you plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.
7444	Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness, however, you shouldn't suffer because of the poor decisions of others. If you do plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income. You are entitled to that amount. Make sure you have receipts for everything. It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.
7445	My Opinion, you should never give up custody over a child because your partner is being a jerk. It is your child and should be considered your top priority.  You should contact child protective services to get their opinion of their opinion of his conduct with this child.  If they agree with your request you can file the papers to have the courts order him to step aside.  You may want to ask for sole custody or child support if you feel the safety of your child is at risk.
7446	Yes, if you feel that his involvement in your daughter's life is damaging to her health or your relationship, you have a right to request sole custody of your child.  This can be hard to prove especially if there has never been a court order in place regarding visitation.  My opinion is that the court would order specific days for visitation first.  If he doesn't follow the visitation dates, the court will assume that this is giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody.  Again this may take some time.  As for child support, definitely.  He would be subject to back child support from the day your daughter was born unless he can prove that he was actually paying.  You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents.  Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them.  The more information you have about your daughters' dad the better, such as job information, social security number, driver's license number, address, etc.
7447	Yes, if you feel he is doing more harm than good by being involved in her life, you have the right to ask for sole custody.  This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never been a court order in place as far as visitation.  My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first.  If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody.  Again, this may take some time.  As for child support, definitely. He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying.  You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents.  Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them.  The more information you have about your daughters father the better, i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
7448	Yes, you should be able to file for sole custody (and place the child for support) if you feel your ex is hurting the child or if you do not have contact with the child.  The court will support it or deny it but if you are concerned about the children feelings, my best advice is to go ahead and file for sole custody.
7449	Yes, you have the right to ask for sole custody if you think he is making more damage than good.  This is a pretty tough case to prove, but you can try.  My opinion, the judge would first order specific dates for visitation.  If he didn't follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody.  Again, this may take some time.  As for child support, definitely.  He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying.  You can file these child support payment/custody documents, not hard to fill out, and the more information you have about your daughter's dad the better i.e. job information, social security, drivers license, address, etc.
7450	Yes, the effects from "weed" are less than the effects of alcohol if it was legal people would less likely go to prison. And people who use it for medical purposes wouldn't have to go through all the garbage they need now to get relief. And less people would use hard drugs.
7451	yes!!! THAT’S how effective it is. If it was legal it would free up space in our prisons, where they are placed for a non-violent crime. And I believe it would cause less people to use harder drugs. And people who need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go thru all the garbage they need to now. For relief!!!!
7452	To give those with medical needs access to illegal drugs is a very unpopular choice for both legal and illegal users.
7453	True. When marijuana is legalized, some people won't see the need for harder drugs. This would free up places in prisons where they could be used for non-violent crimes. The people who need marijuana for medical reasons won't have to go through all the garbage they need to now for relief!
7454	Yes the effects of "marijuana" are much less than the effects of alcohol, if it was legal it would free up alot of space in our prisons. Where they are placed for non-violent crimes, and I believe it would cause much less people to use harder drugs. Also people that need it for medical reasons wouldn't have to go through all the garbage that they need to now for relief.
7455	Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise.  However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.  So the answer to your question is yes.  Hope this helped somewhat.
7456	I'm not quite sure I understand your question because when you make a petition and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, it's only a petition not a legal document. A petition on its own has no legal standing; it only has the power to incite a legislator or an official to make a legal change by providing that specific petition.  Now the legislator may well wish to take a step in the direction of the petition, if it's in his/her best interest to do so, but it may not be so easy to say "yes" to a request for "prohibit" or "ban".  As well, it's much easier to "pass" laws that prohibit or ban things than it is to change them by vote.
7457	Petitions are legal documents...for example, if you get a bunch of people to sign their name to a petition for no smoking, it can legally be enforced by the govt if it is in your country's legislators best interest to do so. So yes, you can make petitions on almost anything to get them to do anything.
7458	When you go to legislators offices and ask them to take action on an issue and get enough signatures, the petition does have some legal standing, but it does not change the actual law in the country.
7459	I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions are legal in and of themselves and you can get petitions signed on almost any topic. However, a petition is not a legal document and doesn't itself have legal standing. Now, if you get enough petitions that say the same thing that are signed by enough people, it could be in the legislator's best interest to perform a certain action. This is known as "hag laws" or "mass petitioning" and there are many examples of this in our modern history, such as bills banning tobacco, burkas, guns, etc.   So the answer to your question is yes.  Hope this helped somewhat.
7460	Whether you agree with God's view of nakedness or not, you should be careful of how you look at naked women, because pornography is bad, and taking to your bed an alcoholic, is a bad idea.
7461	No. God never specifically mentioned in his laws that lusting after a naked woman was against his laws, but in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any honest man will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman. So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
7462	Of course, God never specified that touching a woman naked was forbidden in the bible. Jesus did say, that it was a good idea to think about a beautiful woman before you had sex with her, but no one ever says that touching a woman is forbidden as long as you do it in a Christian way (of course). So, there is no problem with staring at a naked woman, the problem is to touch it.
7463	No. God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws. However, in Matthew, Jesus states (in relation to adultery) that if you lust after a woman in your thoughts, then you are just as guilty as if you have sex with her. You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.  So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
7464	No, God never specified that looking at a naked woman was against his laws.

You can lust after a woman with her clothes on or off, but any male (that's honest) will tell you that it is much easier to lust over a naked woman than a clothed woman.  So no, it's not against God's law, but it's not a very good idea. Like taking an alcoholic to a bar, it's just better to stay away from that kind of temptation.
7465	Is it ethical if your father's insurance goes up? Yes, if it were later reviewed, then it would probably be good. However, if you are insured, then it is fine. Is it good to pay a doctor's bill if you are not insured? It is not good, because it might be unexpected. Yes, when you got the ticket, it was okay, because the ticket is just an action of traffic law. It is not a big issue. Therefore, in order to avoid the unexpected, you should pay it, because it will probably be review. However, if you didn't pay it, then you might have a problem on your new insurance policy, because the doctor might have to pay it, or your father might have to pay it or at least inform the driver and you might have to pay the fine. This is an ethical problem. However, you are not at fault, so you don't have to pay it.
7466	According to my opinion, ethically, it is yours. Suppose you are insured on your father's insurance and if your father gets a ticket and it's his insurance policy and he has to pay for the ticket, then you should be insured on his policy because it is fair because if you don't, it is considered an insurance violation.
7467	If your insurance company goes up, then you should pay it. It might get reviewed in 6 months. However, the good news is that this is just life lessons learned. You got a ticket for improper passing, no big deal. She got a ticket because she was half to blame, at least. Let’s assume there is a big doctor bill. You are probably insured on your father’s policy, had you been at fault. Your friend has the problem and he is totally at fault. He let you use the car. Now if there is a big claim, he is not insured because he didn’t list you as a separate driver and he might have to pay out of his pocket. This is his problem not yours. I don’t see this as an ethical problem for you because you are insured.
7468	If the insurer raises the insurance fee, you should pay it. It will probably be reviewed with in 6 months. However, the good news is this is just life's lessons learned.

7470	Wow, that has to hurt you a lot. I cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved. However, I do not think you are. If his boss doesn't care about the people who are in the company, I would not either. Sounds like his boss needs to get with the times and realize that gays, interracial couples, lesbians and most relationships are common place. I am sure if he keeps pushing your boyfriend that he will make a decision to find another firm rather than loose you. Good luck
7471	Wow that had to hurt you alot. I cannot imagine the thought that you were holding back someone you loved. But I do not think you are. If he's not worried I wouldn't either.

7475	Although the crime rate is actually going down, the rate of incarceration is going up. This reflects the US' "war on crime" and "war on drugs" started in the late 70s, early 80s (Reagan, mostly). It's because we are taking action and using incarceration as the solution.  To really properly analyze these numbers you also have to look at the crime rates of other nations (we also score very poorly, there, so you still have a point).  The statistics for African-Americans is even worse - something like 6000+ African-American inmates per 100,000.

7477	This stats are correct to a point in the USA, however, African-americans experience an even more terrifying number - about ten times the African-American, or African in general, incarceration ratio. Really, to get a proper reading on this, you have to look at the crime rates of all these nations.

7480	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments don't have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were not drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. Then again, people don't usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
7481	There is no requirement for each driver to video tape every FST; your department probably didn't "forget" to tape the computer about your performance in all FST's.

7485	Sounds to me like you want to teach this person a lesson. Sorry to say that those aren't good legal grounds for a lawsuit. You will never find an attorney to take this kind of case on contingency. If your reputation was not actually harmed, then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.

If your reputation was not actually damaged, then I would say to have a talk with the person, their manager, etc and then let it go.
7487	Yes, you should attempt to reason with the person that was hurt by your actions. Do not try to "find" the person, but try to reach out and try to reason with them to find a solution to their problem. Perhaps the person misunderstood, perhaps the question was sensitive and the answer in regards to their request was unclear to them. In any case, you should attempt to find a solution to their problem so you can solve yours. If your reputation was not hurt then I would say to have a talk with the person, their boss, etc and then let it go.

7490	Don't let them do this.  A person listed as "payable on death" does not have ANY interest in your account while you are still alive. They just get the assets left after your death and are not on the hook for any liabilities. Let them know that you get a lawyer if they don't change their tune, and that it will cost them at least $800. Bankstolekids'money? Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.

7494	These big banks are not the saviors of society - in fact, they are the greatest criminals in America!  Rather than give money to their self-serving, greedy thugs, we should pass laws that make them pay a penalty for stealing from children.  Most judges and any jury in the world would eat that up.
7495	It is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad but since she is in jail she cannot be doing anything harmful. If you fight this hard it is possible to get sole custody but it is going to be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation arrangements. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. I would go talk to a lawyer about this. The first consultation is usually free.

7500	Sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bullying has no excuse. Best wishes.

7510	Be able to be 18 now and still not be able to vote.  Change the law first offense:Attempted Murder because adults are drunk!
7511	That is exactly what the federal government is doing.  And if everyone did their research before they answered this question, they would know that it is not the 18-20 age group that ranks highest in drunk driving.  Change the drunk driving law, first offense: attempted murder. In my opinion that is exactly what they are doing, but punishing adults?  Give me a break. I know responsible 18 year olds, and yet my dad who is 57 is a drunk and always has been. Age has nothing to do with it. If 18 is a legal adult, then it should be the age for everything!!!
7512	I am in favor of lowering the drinking age to 18. I'm also for abolishing the minimum drinking age. Age has nothing to do with it.  Once again, the federal government gives out millions to states who pass certain laws. This is one of them.  And if everyone did their research before they answered this question, they would know that it is not the 18-20 age group that ranks highest in drunk driving.  Change the drunk driving law, first offense: attempted murder.  In my opinion that is exactly what they are doing.  But punishing adults?  Give me a break.  I know responsible 18 year olds, and yet my dad who is 57 is a drunk and always has been.  Age has nothing to do with it.  If 18 is a legal adult, then it should be the age for everything!!!
7513	Raising the drinking age would mean a lot of money wasted, it will have no effect whatsoever, and it will not cut off anyone's ability to drink.
7514	There are some laws for adults that are not enforced for adults that are 18.  And the drinking age is not one of them.  It is ok to be 18 for most things, but 18 drinking for each and every one's lives isn't fair.  In fact, for every person drunk driving, 10 die in an auto accident.  For example, on average, 18 drunken kids die every year due to drunk driving.  Not adults.  And we really should lower the drinking age for teens.  Mothers of 8 teenagers, how can they stand to watch them leave home drunken and drive off into a ditch?  Unfortunately, 18's laws are designed to target older teens and parents who live with those teens at home can not have a say.  18 is an adult, their reason should be to protect the rest of the community and people with children.  We should at least as adults, start drinking when we are 21 years old to better our health.  Also, as an adult, we could better pay attention to our health, and how much we are drinking and drink more responsibly.
7515	Latinos as a whole or to an specific group. I know that a lot of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans were born south of the US, but not every individual born in South America is a Spanish speaker. This also means that Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans may speak the same accent as Northern Americans when they move to California. So when people on the East Coast say something Puerto Rican/Spanish you should probably do some research and find out if it is the right accent because some people say it is not the right accent. If we allowed certain groups and countries into the country without doing any research, then why would we be asking people to do research when a government officer requests it?
7516	As far as I know, there is no justifiable reason for having a different accent. Do we consider this problem when we do a case about someone's accent?
7517	Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture i do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
7518	Latinos of any nationality are not all the same and are not all called latino, usually those that come to the US from Latinamerica are the ones that call themselves Latino. It is a very different culture from that of other parts of the world. That is why I was speaking as an educated person coming from a varied culture, not as the laziest excuse to evade responsibility. I was also saying that you are allowed into another country and it should be acceptable to learn its customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
7519	I don't know what you are referring to, but I am an American (being born and raised in the United States), and so am not the "best judge of a culture," as you put it. However, before I can judge any culture, I must first learn and understand it and my cultural background wouldn't allow me to understand any other culture. Thus, how can I be right about the culture of a person from another culture if I don't even understand it myself?
7520	One of the main problems with this punishment method is it does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Maybe a combination, frontal lobotomy and castration, will do the trick, but I can't see any State passing this into law. I'm more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
7521	Through years of research, I've determined that execution of prisoners does nothing to remove the mental drive of the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts. Maybe a combination, frontal lobotomy and castration, will do the trick, but I can't see any state passing this into law. I'm more in favor of the two strikes and your shot approach. Besides, bullets are so much cheaper than surgery.
7522	Of course there are many instances that a person with a gun is the right course of action. We need to be aware of the facts to know what to do in these cases, and I'm all in favor of taking steps to have guns allowed in the market. I've also been over the place about bullet proof vests and I agree, we need to be secure. Like always, we should put into consideration the number of criminals in our area and the rate of guns getting into the hands of those criminals.
7523	To me the problem with this is it does not remove the mental drive from the perpetrator. He will still have the same thoughts and that creates a loophole for people to be misunderstood, mistreated, or even killed by a good citizen who was in some sort of mental illness. To combat this I would say use force. Mental illness is a psychological problem, and cannot be treated medicallly. It can be treated by force if that is necessary.
7524	I think the solution would be the application of people trafficking laws. Whenever you work with a child, irrespective of age, you need to be compensated. If they are not properly looked after, the nurse or teacher who has allowed it to happen will be punished. If the girl is young, it is the parents that should be punished. The victims would just be allowed to go free and forget about it.
7525	 Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?   I disagree with your argument, because retribution is viewed by many people as social cohesive due to the extensive attention given to it.  The Catholicism believe that retributive justice is inherently wrong; therefore, when the subjects of Catholicism are allowed to view transgression as socially cohesive, they are implicitly saying that the Catholic view is the only right and true view of society.
7526	We should punish criminals for undermining social "harmony" or "balance."  Therefore, we must first define what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The process of defining social harmony or balance is socially cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the process of accepting and agreeing on laws, customs, and religions is socially cohesive. The rehabulation theory of punishment is probably the most cohesive because it is based on rehabilitating the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.
7527	Bad behavior is not a crime.  A crime is the act of breaking a law.  Therefore, our society does not regard the threat of retribution, punishment or rehabilitation of the offender as being socially cohesive.
7528	To a large extent, the rehabilitation theory of punishment is the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabilitating criminals so that they can successfully reenter society.
7529	Well, this is kind of vague.  Think of some examples and then write in how you feel about these.  Keep in mind that you should maintain coherence.  Do you think that forgiveness is necessary for social harmony?  Many people hold this belief because they think that actions speak louder than words and that violence, regardless of the motive, is uncalled for.  However, I think that forgiveness is necessary for social harmony.  I believe that forgiveness requires empathy.  If we didn't have empathy we wouldn't have the will to forgive.  Having the will to forgive forces us to try and understand the motives behind the violence committed.  For example, people kill each other over a petty argument.  The person who loses, or the one who is hurt, may not be willing to forgive because they are focused on their feelings of anger and hurt.  If they didn't have a willingness to forgive then they would simply keep bitching about the petty argument that brought on the bicker and not think about the consequences of their actions.  In my opinion, society is in chaos because not all of the laws, customs, and religions apply to all of the people.  A few people do not have the will to open up their minds and think for themselves.  In order for society to function properly and, in fact, be cohesive, some people must come out of their comfort zone and give up something.  But the more they give up the more danger they put themselves in.  But since society has already done this for them we are stuck in a middle ground between working with the laws and customs or acting out on our own authority.  So the problem with society is that it has limited people.  We can get over the problem by changing the laws and customs of society so that everyone is able to participate in it and see how it works.  Thus, the cause of social disharmony is that the laws
7530	The bad thing is that they can still live in a pop-up camper, as they were hard workers that didn't deserve to lose everything because of the abuse they received from the government. I have a family that lived in St. Bernard and they lost everything and can't find the same paying job as they had there. They now live in a pop-up camper, because it is a safer option and safer than their old camper. It was disgusting to see these people doing all of these things with FEMA-card (some even bought wide screen TVs while they were in the boondocks, for their new living quarters!) because of this abuse, there are still hard working people that don't deserve to live the way they have to.
7531	The question is still valid, however, since the FEMA Program is intended to help states and cities that are experiencing natural disasters, and noones has opposed the expediency of offering such help to victims of Hurricane Katrina, it seems that it is most appropriate to not hold them to any standards, but to aid as many as possible, because financial constraints and geographic factors are less of a concern and therefore, the government did in fact give their aid to victims without going by a set of rules.
7532	There is a lot of bad that takes place in the housing situation, but the lives of hard working folks should be protected. Some of these people were not supposed to lose their homes but were displaced when they had nowhere to go to. I have family that lives down the street that lost everything because they lived in St. Bernard Parish and can't find the same paying job in our parish. So they are still living in a pop-up camper. It was disgusting that these people were doing all these things with the FEMA card (some even bought wide screen TVs while they were in the Cajun Dome for a shelter!).
7533	It's a bad thing that there are still lots of innocent people who are displaced and looking for jobs (that our state doesn't have). I have a family that lives down the street from me that lost everything because they lived in St. Bernard Parish. They can't find the same paying job in our parish. So, they are still living in a pop-up camper. It was disgusting that these people were doing these things with the FEMA card (some even bought wide screen TVs while they were in the Cajun Dome for a shelter!) because of this abuse, there are still hard-working people out there that don't deserve to live the way they have to.
7534	The real issue that is not being addressed is that there are many innocent people that are displaced and looking for jobs, and some have no permanent place to call home. I live in a village where there were three families that lost everything because they lived in St. Bernard parish, and they can't find the same paying job in our parish, and are still living in a pop-up camper. It was disgusting that these people were doing all these things with the FEMA card because of this abuse, many hard working people that don't deserve to live the way they do.
7535	In the court, if someone gives sworn testimony and doesn't say the truth it is illegal.
7536	As far as a statistic, I'm not sure. However, I think that people lie in court all the time. People are either honest or dishonest. I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automatically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth. It just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swore to, then it's illegal. And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, then it's probably not going to bother them if they do something illegal.

7540	Yes, fight for your rights. Don't give him any sex. The most important thing of course is the welfare of the children and remember, documentation, documentation. I hope you have paperwork on everything that has happend in your life and witnesses. He has to pay child support no matter what, he is their father and has to support them (like it or not/wage garnishment). And don't question yourself if you need financial help, you do and you deserve it. Good Luck and I hope things work out for you and your children.

7545	I'm not sure about whether it's a criminal act or not. I think that it is a personal decision that should be made based on what you feel comfortable with.
7546	There is no need to judge somebody who can't move for the life of him because in reality we are all different. There are some people that are naturally big, and those are the ones that are the most misunderstood.
7547	Physical competence and mass are not the same thing. Yes, an extremely large person may be physically incapable of certain tasks due to the requirements of the task. My father weighs over 600 pounds and he has several physical disabilities but we understand and value his physical abilities and they play a huge part in who we are and how we interact with the world around us. The same is true for many people who are large or overweight. But this has nothing to do with mass or body fat.
7548	It is not a crime for someone to be too fat, but it certainly puts a negative impact on your health. There are a lot of people with diseases caused by obesity, and you do not have to be too thin to get those diseases. Some people are naturally heavy, and these people are misunderstood.
7549	When you can't move to get something or do something, for example when you can't walk, or if you are too fat for that, then you are heavy. My father is 600 pounds and he can't even walk anymore, but this doesn't make him a criminal act since he doesn't eat himself to death. Other people are heavier than him and it is their choice to be heavier than normal. Therefore, it is not the others fault if they can eat themselves to death.
7550	If I walk in my house and my only child is lying dead on the floor and I discover that my beautiful wife has just been raped by the killer. As I walk in the room he drops his knife and tells me he gives up because I have a gun in my hand. Your damn right he's going straight to hell that night. Why should it be any different if he gets caught months later.
7551	PUT IT THIS WAY. IF I walk in my house and my only child is lying dead on the floor and I discover that my beautiful wife has been raped by the killer. As I walk in the room he drops his knife and tells me he gives up because I have a gun in my hand. Your damn right he's going straight to hell that night. Why should it be any different if he gets caught two months later.
7552	He should go straight to Hell that night because he got caught. Why should it be any different if he gets caught months later?

Your right, he's going straight to hell that night. Why should it be any different if he gets caught months later?
7554	It's unfair for you to be punished for your loved one's mistake, even if they were drunk and could have been wiser. The law should not punish you for something that would normally be dealt with by your family.
7555	In general, a parent may use "reasonable force" in disciplining a minor child.  However, what is "reasonable" from one situation to another may vary greatly.  For example, the use of force would be more reasonable if an older child is at risk of seriously harming a younger child, than if that older child was simply late for dinner.  
7556	Reasonable force is used in disciplining a child when it's appropriate for each situation, for example if there are older children who have harmed younger children or if the child is late for dinner.
7557	This is not an easy question to answer.  In most states, there is no simple answer.

7560	why don't we just legalize murder, fraud, robbery, rape and smoking marijuana. Smoking is illegal but millions of people around the world support the 911 attacks. Does that make it right? Crime is crime and people who commit it should be punished. Lock up the criminals who use, grow, and sell marijuana.
7561	Why do we punish people who steal, lie, rape, and murder? Why are crime rates high in our society? It would be nice to know why and to get rid of our fears over it.
7562	Why don't we just legalize murder, fraud, robbery, and rape. Smoking marijuana is illegal and just because millions do it doesn't make it right.

Whatever u think, when you kill someone, there is only one punishment that may be appropriate, and that is the ultimate price of your own life.
7564	Just because millions of people support the 9/ 11 attacks does not mean that they are right. Criminal is criminal and the people who commit it should be punished. In America it is illegal to use, grow and/or sell marijuana.
7565	People these days are too busy to see what is going on in the world. I may not know everything, but from what I think people are just too stupid to just watch what Bush and his regime here is doing. You see, people are sometimes too poor to buy their own TV set or even a newspaper because of taxes, gas prices, and ALL OF THEIR LITTLE STUPID FRIENDS!!!!!! And there is my opinion, you may not like what I just wrote, but deal with it!

In addition, people are sometimes too lazy to read all their stupid friends!!!!! All right then you can do what i just said!!!

7570	It grates on the hearts and minds of the families of the victims that their loved one will never get another holiday, another birthday or even just one more day, with their murderer still alive. There is just something inherently fair about executing a murderer.
7571	Once a murderer is executed, they will never escape and never harm anyone else. It grates on the hearts and minds of the families of the victim that their loved one will never get another holiday, another birthday or even one more day, with their murderer still alive. It brings a measure of relief to the families. There is just something inherently fair about executing a murderer.

7575	In some countries that have banned guns, and has seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves? In fact, every country that has gone after guns with tyranny and violence has seen an increase in crime. There are a lot of reasons for the two parties, but most of it revolves around political correctness.
7576	your question should be, "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in person-to-person crimes and burglaries?"  Or, "Since some countries that have banned guns and have seen an increase in crime, why don't their governments reinstate their gun rights so the citizens can protect themselves?"  See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a intelligent discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hostility and open biases into it?
7577	The war in Iraq created a number of human rights violations but the war in Vietnam did not.
7578	Because people think every country that enforces gun bans has an increase in crime and burglaries. But that's a stupid view because some countries which have bred gun rights have seen an increase in crime, they simply have become better and more populated and capable at keeping law and order.
7579	Anti gunners bring some misconception into their argument. They argue that everybody should be able to carry guns to protect themselves from crime, and yet this is incorrect. Even countries where gun ownership was considered to be illegal had an increase in crime and burglaries. The states that have restored gun rights, such as California, have seen an increase in crime and burglaries, but so did they where gun ownership is legal. So, you need to change your question to this: "Why is it that every country that's enforced gun bans has an increase in crime and burglaries?" Or, "Can you give me a reason why some countries that have banned guns have seen an increase in crime and burglaries, but they don't have the right to keep gun ownership banned?" See how that's more diplomatic, and more inviting to a discussion about the issue, instead of introducing hositlity and open biases into it?
7580	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
7581	Let's not mention the hate he spreads on the daily news.  The whole reason that "church" keeps going is because they get publicity.  Check with TV stations to stop the coverage.  If a group of people are around you, you have the right to tell them how their words and actions offend you.  Let's take the ball out of their court.  2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, don't attend.  I would rather people keep their hate from me and my fellow Christians.  We have a right to say whatever we like.  3. Support organizations, such as PFLAG, who work against discrimination, bigotry and homophobia.  Support the same causes yourself.  I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, and keep things as simple and direct as I could.
7582	I'm sorry, but my answer is not a solution.  By quoting things I'm basically suggesting counter-demonstrations.  I do understand the topic, though. It is of interest to the entire world.
7583	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
7584	Well, there are a few ways. Here are a few: 1. Don’t cover his hate mongering on the daily news. The whole reason "church" keeps going is that they get publicity. If the funeral or event is being covered, contact the local TV station or event promoter and tell them how much the demonstrations are hurting and offending you.  This applies only if they are in your community.  If you are not, stand in front of them with your backs to them.  You can use your rights under the 1st amendment to stand in front of them.  You have the right to do this from the 1st amendment, just like they do.  2. If you are at a funeral or event where they are present, either tell them how much their actions hurt and offend you, or stand in front of them with your backs to them.  You have the right to do this from the 1st amendment, just like they do.  3. Support organizations that fight discrimination, bigotry and homophobia.  Support the same causes yourself.  I tried to limit my answer to things an individual can do, vs. staging a counter-demonstration and other things that require lots of people and money.  Thanks for your thoughtful question.
7585	If non-smokers right were violated why didn't they and do get their way? How about smokers right?
7586	Is smoking in restaurants and bars a right or a violation? It's a right to be sure but it also violates other people's rights. Smoking in restaurants and bars seems like a violation of non-smokers' rights but I think if people wanted their non-smoking areas with fans that's fine and if non-smokers wanted to go to the smoker's area that's cool too. I see that as basically dictating what others do and trying to get their way because they don't want to face the facts. If non-smokers rights were apparently violated the smoker's would and do get their way. I suppose the smoker's rights should take precedence and violations have to be forgiven
7587	I'll be honest with you because I don't think that non smokers rights were violated. The right of non smokers not to smoke in restaurants is just good common sense. Who would want to smoke in an area that has fans? Non smokers can request that smoking areas have fans. The desire to ban smoking just opens the door to a lot of other problems. Who's right in the end?
7588	Smoking is a small coping mechanism in nature. It has helped us survive in times when we needed to think faster than the rest of us. Some non smokers have had their non smoking areas with fans, wasn't that enough? I guess not. People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. How about smoker's rights?
7589	Why was smoking banned in public places, like restaurants and bars? Non smokers have had their non smoking areas with fans. Wasn't that enough? People just want to dictate what others do so they can get their way. If non-smokers had their rights respected then they would and do get their way. How about smokers rights?
7590	If the world agreed to help the insurgents and terrorists would be eliminated, but that does not happen, because 90% of the world hates the U.S., especially now. I think Bush made this stupid and meaningless war, it was an unnecessary war. Completely! Maybe that's why the world is just watching to see the mess the U.S. made, how they are trying to fix it and how much they are trying to fix it. But Bush will never admit it was a terrible mistake going there and starting this war. Well maybe on his deathbed he would. I do agree though, that if all of the world helped, the insurgents and terrorists would be eliminated. But that does not happen because most of the world hates the U.S., especially now.
7591	Given the fact that all of the world was against starting this war and Bush is already dead, it wouldn't be a terrible mistake to start this war.
7592	The main reason the United States was attacked on 9/11 was because the Bush administration got it wrong and ended up sending Americans to fight another war instead of learning from the mistakes of the bombing of the Luftwaffe in the Pacific. The U.S. sent millions of troops and thousands of bombs to Afghanistan and Iraq, supposedly to eradicate the networks that attacked the American War planes on 9/11. Yet that simply created a new network of terrorists that killed more American soldiers. Despite this, the Bush administration went on to sign off on the U.N. resolution that authorized a bombing campaign that left thousands dead and millions disabled. The U.N. must be held accountable for this stupid resolution. The U.N. does not have the authority to sign off on war, because U.N. rules say that a state member cannot go to war without the permission of the U.N. Or, at least, a state that accepts all of the U.N.’s principles as binding.
7593	Such as national news.
7594	I'm not sure why the world was in favor of war; it wasn't necessary and we ended up having many years of horrible unhappiness in the Middle East and Iraq. And if the Iraqis had their way, we wouldn't have much of Iraq left either. Also, the US ended up having a horrible war that it did not deserve. I think the world's reaction to Bush's decision to start the war was unreasonable. I'm really disappointed that the rest of the world did not work together to help the Bush administration stop their mistake.
7595	If someone one wants to be racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
7596	If someone is fat they should be called obese not fat. If someone is a bitch they should be called a bitch, not a bitch. If someone is dirty, they should be called a slut. If someone is red neck, they should be called a redneck. There are worse things a person could be.
7597	If someone wants to be a racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
7598	Everyone should call people by their names. They are not better or worse than you just because of the name that they have. That's what makes this world so bad. If someone feels the need to call you one thing then by all means let them do it and let them live their lives the way that they choose.
7599	Or if you,re called a fat@$$ or a b!tch or a sl*t or a whore or a wet-back or a chink or a red-neck.... I mean come on where does it end? It's so stupid. If someone one wants to be racist, then by all means let him be a racist. There are worse things a person could be.
7600	If you're asking for yourself, I'd say that's pathetic. You want to sue a bar because you got arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk? I would really love to to sit on that jury someday.
7601	If you're trying to sue a bar for an arrest, I can't think of much worse than getting held down and having liquor poured down your throat. Maybe turn you into a jerk in the process. Anyway, I'd love to sit on that jury.
7602	If you are asking for yourself, I would say that that is pathetic. You want to sue a bar for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk? I would love to sit on that jury someday.
7603	If you're asking for yourself I'd say that's pathetic, you want to sue a bar because you got arrested for public intoxication? What did they do? Hold you down and pour tequila down your throat and make you turn into a jerk? I'd love to sit on that jury someday, I hope you'll be able to practice some personal responsibility
7604	The manager should have done the right thing by getting you arrested for public intoxication and forcing you to do community service in his bar.
7605	In certain situations it would be permissible for government to step in, protecting society by limiting the freedom of a person that affects others in a negative way. The government works for all of us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to, but there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action for the country, then the government should have every right to do so.
7606	If what someone is doing affects another person or group in a negative way, the government should be allowed to step in. The government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to, but there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action, then the government should have every right to do so.
7607	In certain cases it would be permissible for government to step in and block a person's freedoms. For example, if a person is doing something that negatively affects another person or group. The government works for us as a whole, not each individual person. We are allowed certain freedoms and to do most things the way we want to, but there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting one person's freedoms is the best plan of action, the government should have every right to do so
7608	I'm not sure that I would agree with it. If something affects other people in a negative way and the government has done nothing, then the government should do something, but I do believe that one should be responsible for their own actions.
7609	On a similar note, if what somebody does is affecting society in a negative way, the government should be allowed to step in. The government works for the people as a whole, not each individual, and we are allowed certain freedoms. However, there are limits on everything. If protecting society by limiting the freedoms of a person is the best action to take, then the government should have every right to do so
7610	I've had a hard time finding anything positive to look at lately. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food and shelter and a job, but I find that there is not much to look positively on. For example, everyone's always buried in their cellphones. I can barely enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to film the show. It has ruined every social situation I can think of.  Something else I noticed is that a lot of people are becoming more accepting of more and more people. The thing is though, it seems like it's more of a fad to like it instead of actually accepting them. I know, I probably am a monster for saying this, but it's how I feel...
7611	There's nothing positive to look at about this decade. Don’t get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food and shelter and a good job, but I find that there’s not a lot to look positively on.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food, shelter and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively on.

7615	In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrition and water. Everything is society, such as wealth, income, education, and etc. are just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They do not exist in the physical world. Hunting and gathering don’t need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancies. So what? There is no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusion to make our lives content. 
7616	Most traditional religions are based on belief in some sort of supernatural elements. That is why most religions are required to comply to certain rules or get penance of certain kind. We don't think that these supernaturals are real. However they may give us comfort in our alienation. The basics of the supernaturals are there to fill the vacuum in our lives that make us comfortable.
7617	Your basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything is society, such as wealth, income, education, and etc are just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They don't exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusion to make our lives content.

7620	Yes, it's true that it is quite useful for new generations. It shows the better course in a certain situation and thus might be interesting, but it should not be required as a scientific discipline. All researchers should use other ways of achieving their goals instead of teaching or writing historical texts. Historical studies are not as important as your opinion on things though.
7621	Everyone in school has to learn what happened in the past with the argumentation, We have to learn from our mistakes. However, why for example are we tolerating dictators when the past showed how awful Hitler was and how he abused his political power? The only thing we are learning is how it happened in the past, it might be interesting, but it's unnecessary for the further improvement of our lives and society. The only thing I see people with a degree in historical studies doing is teaching younger persons or writing historical texts. I don't understand why it's so highly regarded even though it's all for our enjoyment. I don't think it should be called as a subject in scientific discipline.

7624	There are many reasons for the historical persuasion. One of the main reasons is that it shows what happened in the past. In fact, it's very interesting to know about the events that happened in the past because what happened was in the past. I do not think that we should accept dictators because in the past you can see that Hitler abused his power and many other dictators did this. The only thing we learn from the past is how they behaved not how we should behave. So the only reason for using the persuasion is that it's interesting and it can bring valuable insights about the world we live in. If you have a degree in history this subject is available to you for your enjoyment. If you want to use historical persuasion in modern history, for example, if you want to help children learn from the past, this subject would be a good idea. It would be a good option and not necessary for you to teach it.
7625	If we stay around here for the next 11 to 12 years it might end up being a Dodge Charger or a Crown Vic. It'll have a roof rack shaped like their siren lights, a spotlight connected to the driver's side, a ram-cage on the front and maybe some numbers in the corner on the back, and maybe the side too. I think writing something close to POLICE on the side would be too far, but the color will be the same and I'll make sure I slap on everything I can.

7626	Taking my one point-He does live in a very dangerous area. Also, going to move into another neighborhood sounds like this type of behavior will be pushed that neighborhood. I agree with expol2 on one point that we don't live in a dangerous area. Unless in danger I don't see him acting provocative.

7630	I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than two minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drive away. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus police. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I believe that every college campus should be forced to allow it, regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the danger of students carrying. However, statistics have proven that people with criminal histories almost always commit crimes less often than people without licenses.

The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying, but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses. The immediate worry from this is children who are in classrooms learning about being tapped to carry. If the campus gets cut off when the son or daughter gets home, is there really a risk of that occurring? This has two immediate issues on campuses: 1. how do you handle potential threats in a classroom. 2. how are students going to react to hear a campus have legalized carry?

7634	In view of the threat of violence that I have faced for three times, I am advocating for campus carry of personal lasers. I believe that every college campus should be required to allow it, and that no matter what the Deans or students think about the law, it should be enforced.

Statistics have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without lasers.
7635	Mainstream feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. In a world where everyone is equal and where the only binary are gender and race, low-hanging fruits like street harassment and people submitting to jilted favors are no longer worthy of any attention or protest. I see where you're coming from here, but as a woman of color myself, I have to disagree. The work of gentrifying marginalized populations needs to be factored into capitalism, a part of the process of social, political, and economic equality. As a feminist, I think it's my duty to my community to put an emphasis on that sort of work.
7636	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the work place and education, or women's movements (which help women make better choices for themselves) need not campaign on personal matters that fall under the ambit of their rights, and actually do harm to women. I don't get why street harassment, terms of address, etc. should be a primary focus of feminism. All of these issues can be avoided by being more educated. Women can do great things as activists all the time, without campaingng personal issues that can be avoided.
7637	As simplistic as this sounds, from a socio-economic standpoint, mainstream activist feminism (tumblr feminism aside) is beginning to look like a group of middle class/upper middle class women bullying the poor and working class over their day-to-day behavior, while leaving the institutions that hurt women of all classes untouched. In these instances, they (mainstream feminists) are exercising a right they have (the right to protest) by stopping the development of certain building codes (Street harassment) or by moving to position themselves on a scale of relation (gender micromanagement). Some women writing in a feminist bent (particularly the movements involving teaching women to be more assertive in the workplace and show more confidence in male colleagues) are exercising a right they have (the right to write in a manner that may differ from someone else). But the actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do more than divide the sexes or incite discrimination. They need to be stopped and prosecuted to prevent other women from having to suffer the same sort of actions.
7638	Supporting the basic concept of feminism (all human beings should be treated equally regardless of gender) is a no brainer, but I don't understand the emphasis on low-hanging fruit like street harassment. The actions and comments of people like Justin Mateen do. So why aren't there hordes of young activists protesting outside of Tinder's offices? Why do street harassment and terms of address merit more attention than institutional discrimination?

7640	Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90's grunge bands did not specifically sell themselves as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock that were consciously selling men as sex objects. But let's take a look at the frontmen:  Kurt Cobain: A good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like Henry Ford  Eddie Vedder: def. above average, pretty man  Scott Weiland: In his pre-anorexia days, a very handsome man  Chris Cornell: Not so sure... think he is good looking? Ladies?  Layne Staley:  I think he is probably the least but still not ugly.  They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?
7641	Layne Staley is good looking as long as he is not anorexic. But I have never seen younger pictures of Stipe.

Layne Staley: he is probably the least. but not ugly.  They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen?

7644	The frontmen of 90s grunge bands didn't just keep the visceral imagery of being gay away from the group. They were also trying to allude to the 1990s neo-nazis.
7645	He did have a mildly aggravating mopey face, but please don't complain about it. There are other aspects of Toby's performance that really impress me, including his chemistry with Ned. I liked that the movies worked to define the characters without having them be Hollywoodized. Peter is one of the most complex characters in all of cinema. Get over it. You can post along with me later about how Peter is one of the more complex characters in all of cinema or whatever, but for now let's ignore his character and his lines to see what else the movies can teach us about love and other movies.
7646	In point of view: Toby Maguire was fine in the first Spider-Men film but he is terrible in the second one. People on the internet constantly complain about his facial expressions, though. I notice the one mildly annoying mopey face. Please elaborate as much as possible about this subject and thank you.
7647	I've been watching the Spider-Man movies (Toby Maguire) probably sound the age of 6 the first time and saw absolutely nothing wrong with them. Watching again 10 years later, I thought maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey, but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? People on internet constantly complain about his various faces. I've only noticed the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject please and thank you.

7650	We know that today there is an increasing demand for sophisticated vehicles with improved performance. It is a very strange argument that fans of manual transmissions love to give. Some of them are actually more efficient in most cases.  I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving, but I can sit down for a bigger meal without incident because a turbo is much better in terms of engine displacement and performance than even a V8. So why would we switch away from a vehicle that can go much, much faster with improved handling through a clutch? Yes, a manual is a lot of work to maintain, but it requires less maintenance than a turbo or hybrid. You will not miss the chance to eat cheeseburgers if you opt for a manual. Now, fans of automatics may argue that the shift points have become infinitely more sophisticated in the last 30 years which makes them far more efficient than stick-shifts. There's no reason why they can't work as well as stick shifter. However, I think most drivers prefer to have an option between a stick-shift and an automatic. A capable manual gearbox is still much better than an automatic gearbox and definitely far more engaging. Many cars will be sold in the next decade without dual-clutch transmissions as they have become a niche model. The majority of owners will be satisfied with even an automatic, let alone a variable transmission. In the same way that most of today's cars are high performance cars that have to match agile handling for a certain driving style, today's automatic transmissions are much more performant than they have ever been. Most drivers of powerful turbo or hybrid vehicles will just find that the car doesn't quite match their tastes or lifestyle, so an automatic doesn't always appeal to them.
7651	With the advent of CVT transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy. There are few reasons to avoid a manual car, but make sure you don't purchase one solely based on the cost. Many people love the sound of their car's intake or exhaust and go into automatic gear boxes for the convenience but inevitably later buy a manual version. If you are afraid to drive a manual car, it is safe to drive stick shifts (at least I have found it to be safe). Strictly for comfort, I am used to a stick shift and switch quickly between 3rd and 4th (to hear the difference) and with occasional cold driving, I will use the S+ in very cold weather and avoid S in winter. In general, the convenience of an automatic transmission negates the price advantage of a manual car but if a manual car is cheaper and you want the convenience, go for it. I don't think "constantly variable transmissions" adds much to the experience of driving. Changes to the car's gearbox in the same way as a human's stomach would reduce the potential for the driver to miss their gear. The chances of a manual gearbox slowing down for no reason are much smaller than a car that has automatic transmission. Changing gears in a manual car is physically more difficult than operating an automatic, especially in a vehicle with the more advantageous body position and larger seat for human's legs. There is also the risk of stalling the car, especially in winter when the car is narrower and less grippy. Not very much to add as it is well covered by the questions above, particularly Point 2. Why do more road users in manual cars? In a head-on crash the chances of a manual car stalling are much higher than in an automatic because the mechanical linkage is more difficult to shift in relation to the vehicle's centre of gravity, but a manual does have the potential to offer a lower risk, perhaps making a more good argument for motorists to purchase automatic transmissions.
7652	With the advent of Constantly Variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy.  The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety. No manual will stop on a busy road. Same with vehicles, nor will they manueal a 60 mph go-kart on a road.  The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term. A car with a manual shift will not be more likely to be in first gear on a hill without a manual, so it is not an issue for hill climbing. Nowadays, CVT vehicles don't have much of a clutch, so they don't have an issue with stalling like manual drivers. The only thing a car with a CVT has an issue with is slow down time because they have to feed power constantly. Of course, manual drivers are more apt to put their clutch in 1 place, thus not changing gears due to this slow downs. Drivers who drive their cars seriously know that not having automatic change speed gears means less recovery time in the event of a crash. At first sight it may be true that they are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. It's true and you should understand that from a driving technique point of view a CVT, on a flat road, is the easiest car to drive (for the average driver). However, it would take you some time to recover after trying to go uphill when you use a CVT. Compared to a manual, its as fast on a stoplight as a CVT, but you will not have enough time to accelerate after the red light is cut to get out of the car before the stoplight is green. It depends on whether you use it or not, but it's definitely true that the more you drive it the less this happens. However, many people still drive and forget to activate the clutch mode. It's still true that drivers prefer manual transmissions
7653	That often the road is a constantly changing landscape. There is not always a safe space for the car to proceed smoothly and quietly. Moreover, motorists are more focused on shifting gears, and carving out a rapid road when city traffic keeps a shifting mind. Driving safely with another car behind also requires constant attention to the road and to switch gears with precision, which can be impossible due to driver error, slippery road conditions, etc. Those objects are all potential dangers. A manual car does not have the advantages of an automatic gearbox regarding noise, and reliability. Also, if the author is left with an empty belly, he may be unable to continue in a vehicle.

The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term. They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving. Please CMV.
7655	The implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the masses through an otherwise intimate means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion, but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.
7656	I would explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion: I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly to the fact that it could have been important. I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if it's automated). Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (I'm not well-versed in law though). I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the masses through an otherwise intimate means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for. I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong. Thanks.
7657	In a single meeting, I was given enough information to persuade the majority of people I have worked with to switch from one of their positions to a position that I perceived to be in better financial security.  I had no memory of any of this and the person who gave me that information didn't need to record it or put it into writing to persuade me...well, almost none of this seems illegal (I'm not well-versed in law). The implications of being able to directly spread dogma through the means of communication appears to be something that people shouldn't have to stand for... well, almost none of this seems illegal.  Thanks for reading
7658	In the anecdotal example I showed, I probably gave the impression that I'm a liberal. I'm not, but, am for the less rights of the government so it can be more vigilant on crimes. But I think it's an important reason to declare bans on banned water bottles.
7659	That is a bit of a red herring.
7660	Teas and green drinks should be chosen as preference rather than sodas and cola drinks. A cup of water per day is beneficial not only for the teeth but for the body.
7661	Let's start with the numbers: Arizona iced tea (lemon): 24 grams of sugar in 8 oz. Coca-Cola Classic: 27 g. Pepsi: 28 g. Ingredients: Arizona: tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor. Coca-Cola: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine. Arizona: tea brewed in filtered water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon flavor. Coca-Cola: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine. Basically they have the same ingredients and I think they shouldn't be used as frequently as they are.

Coca-Cola: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, flavors, caffeine. Their first two ingredients are basically identical: water and high fructose corn syrup. Of course, Arizona gets its flavor mostly from tea leaves while Coke gets it from flavoring. They both stain teeth; Coke has caramel color while Arizona again gets it from the tea leaves. I like both drinks, but I feel at this point that they are both pretty terrible at this point and that they should only be used sparingly. CMV.
7663	You are making a bad argument on this. You didn't say whether you like lemon or lime at all. There is no obvious reason why Arizona Iced Tea should be better than Coca-Cola. The first thing you need to realize is that the amount of sugar in Arizona Iced Tea is more than half of that in Coca-Cola (see the ingredients). In cases like this the side effects are very different between Pepsi and the Coca-Cola, so you could argue that while Pepsi tastes good the ingredients can be harmful. On the other hand, Arizona Iced Tea has much less sugar than Coca-Cola, so it is less likely that the health side-effects would be significant. And you are mixing apples with oranges here; Pepsi is by far superior on that point to Arizona Iced Tea.

7665	It puzzles me how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms.

7670	As far as I can see they want independence but they want to stay in NATO and the UN, they also want to keep the pound as well as all of the infrastructure that we've (the UK) have built up such as the NHS, military, police, fire services etc.  My view at the moment is that if they vote for independence, they should get complete independence. A full and immediate cessation of all funding from the UK government to Scotland and Scottish nationals, immigration controls, them not being allowed to use the pound, being expelled from the UN/NATO (and have to reapply if they wanted to), the immediate withdrawal of the NHS and other services such as British police/fire services and armed forces. At the moment they seem to be like petulant kids that are biting the hand that feeds them. Of course, if this is incorrect, I would love to be corrected. I'm not interested in being wilfully ignorant.

7675	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on their acts. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. I don't think Tesco is acting in rational self-interest because they should be granted a reprieve since this is property destruction. I also wouldn't blame the protesters if they want to go after Tesco and hurt them financially but they should think twice about hurting the public. Many homeless people spend more time at Tesco stores than any other retailer, so their presence would promote them for whatever action is considered civil or peaceful. Also, there are many alternative ways for these homeless people to get to work as opposed to a spiked entrance.

7680	The use of the death penalty on moral reasons is only justified on crimes against humanity. I think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I can't see why the punishment shouldn't be different for different crimes, but it is morally justified if the penalty is killing a person.
7681	I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral reasons for practically every reason other than crimes against humanity. I don't think killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general, and so I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder and rape in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I would like to change my mind. I would like to hear something new though, not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
7682	Usually, capital punishment is used when the crime being committed goes against humanity. For example, homicide against a human being. This is done so that we can make sure that a crime doesn't happen again.
7683	This is an important point for me because killing a person goes against humanity, therefore capital punishment should be used for these acts.
7684	Killing a person is against humanity, therefore, I think capital punishment should be used for something that goes against humanity itself.
7685	The main difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" is whether or not one believes a woman should have the right (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that the woman should have the choice, one isn't advocating abortions (as in they aren't pushing abortions on people or think it's a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the woman should have the choice. Likewise, one can be anti choice yet still believe for wars of aggression, capitalism, etc.
7686	The difference between "pro-choice" and "pro-life" is really just an argument on the woman's right to choose whether or not to get pregnant and to make that choice. By believing that this choice is a person's own, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between the woman and her doctor, and also believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be pro-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
7687	The difference between “pro-life” and “pro-choice” comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.
7688	Pro-Life and Pro-choic should be the same. Also, they aren't opposite ideologies. I mean, do you really think that no one pro-suspect (on moral) testing thought that condoms or sterilization were morally bad? Do you think that no one pro-death penalty thought that a person shouldn't die at 25? Certainly there were and there are pro-life people that think all that is morally wrong, and pro-life people that think we shouldn't kill people. Likewise, there are pro-choice people that think that abortions should always be illegal. The abortion debate doesn't stop there, however. The "pro-choice" side might argue that the male condom causes damage to the baby, or sterilization may also cause damage to the woman (after all, we don't know what the side-effects of some meds are without doing research). The "pro-life" side might argue that sex without having an agreement should be considered rape, or an innocent pregnancy may lead to a life without rights, even if it's a one time encounter. There are also other arguments made by pro-life and pro-choice people that have a big impact on the issue. In
7689	Pro-Life and Pro-Choice can be 2 different positions on the same issues, say about the right to make a choice as to what happens to a baby before its birth. 
7690	I'm definitely against piracy online because most people seem to think it is harmless. You are stealing from big companies like Fox or EA. But those are the producers. The pirate bay doesn't even attempt to hide that it's purpose is to circulate torrented files of copyrighted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site and developing methods to make it harder to take down. Piracy is a sin, and the Pirate Bay is something that should be punished as any other form of crime. 
7691	I'm a platform fanboy for cryptocurrencies that I helped to create. These events are extremely unfortunate for the entire community. Plus, it comes at a very difficult time for me personally, as I work to fund what I believe are many good causes, and use cryptocurrency as the primary currency of transaction. All my contestants are now entitled to their checks on time, and all other payments will follow a few weeks later, when my finances are a little bit more stable. I would encourage you to do the same if you can, at this point.
7692	I'm not against pirating content online, most people seem to think that it's harmless, since you're stealing from big companies like Fox or EA, but those are just the producers, not the actual company that created the content and deserves the money they worked their asses off to earn. Pirate Bay doesn't even attempt to hide that it's purpose is to circulate torrented files of copy righted content. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is wholly justified. 
7693	I'm not entirely sure why Mr. Sunde was arrested. It could have been his organization in combination with other similar sites. They've existed on the dark web as far back as 2010, and have been raking in millions each year, including with tv shows and games. The pirate bay doesn't even attempt to hide their soul purpose of distributing torrented files for free. That's actually a good example of how such actions support piracy. The fact that Mr. Sunde was arrested for his involvement in both creating the site, and developing methods to make it harder for the site to be taken down is wholly justified.

7695	Nobility never deserveses to be referred to by their honorifics because it is completely unearned and it is a system that has historically oppressed individuals. The idea that an award can be given to the individual on behalf of their peers is a historically oppressive way of considering a man worthy of a title. Therefore, I don't think it's appropriate to refer to those individuals by their honorifics.
7696	It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as doctor, your honor, or captain. In certain situations, it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.  However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics in any social context. Why?  (1) Nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not.  (2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.   These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
7697	Personal pronouns can be a reliable guide for when to use different forms of "what", however it's generally regarded that "mine" and "me" refer to the same entity. For instance, "Me" refers to you, but it can also refer to someone else depending on context. However, these cases of ambiguity are rare. These cases might arise only if you have been addressing more than one person. I wouldn't stress it as much as "It depends" since ambiguity is a potential problem any time you are unsure of who you're speaking to, and it likely won't arise in a formal situation.
7698	it is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." But in certain situations, it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles. But why?  (1) Nobility is completely unearned.

7699	When referring to individuals, honorifics such as "Doctor," "your honor," or "Captain." are appropriate in certain social situations. In some situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to someone by their honorifics such as "Nobody calls me 'Vice President'." This, however, is my personal opinion, because there is no harm in referring to someone as "Captain" or "Nobody calls me 'Nobody.'". Why?  (1) Nobleness is completely earned. Nobleness is something that can be achieved by hard work, not based on how you were born. A doctor earned his title, a duke does not.  (2) The system of nobility is one of history. Nobleness is respected among other things because it is historically marked. For instance, a doctor from the renaissance, to get his title, would have to fight a struggle against all of the strict hierarchy that existed at that time to earn his title.  These two reasons remove the obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context.
7700	It's not the amount of money that drives many young adults to some places in the world to start doing drugs. It's more them knowing that if they stay there, nothing is certain and they won't be able to be with someone they care about, and you are made to trust and love. All that and a dejection that they can find other stuff to do.
7701	We have learned that people are not forever. People die, people leave, people change and most importantly, people can't always be there for you - point blank. And when this happens, all you have is Yourself and your goals and your interests to keep you going. The thing is, goals, interests and hobbies have a cost nowadays. $. You better be making enough to do what you enjoy most.]  Cause being lonely and broke is worse than being lonely but making enough to see the movies you want to see and taking the trips you want to take. You have to make enough to keep your own life going so you won't stay stuck in the past.  This is intended as a single group discussion question. It may have two solutions (checkered flag message), one of which is "better" than the other. The first page allows you to write down additional things, clues, links, etc. that you think others may think were missed. The second page is the "Options" page, where people can vote on and write comments on the ideas.  ~ Roger Watkins (author) **Roger, your own solution I said is better than what others think.**   I would write this question as: Q: Are beliefs and values really consistent with principle? P: I have four possible solutions. Each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Today I need to choose one. I choose Solution-A. But that means that I must say I agree with Solution-B. But I do not really agree
7702	We shouldn't put money over people, especially as we are the poster children for success in this digital age. Some people are born wealthy and can always just be so. Some others are born in the low end but can only rise up with hard work. So we don't wanna be that opinionated generation that thinks that we're only interested in money, except for the poor money is important to all of us. When you have a goal, a goal that can only be reached if you have some kind of desire or interest, then it can only be brought about by hard work. So we're saying that if you're born with a goal and a desire that can only be brought about by hard work, then by all means pursue it. If you can't make enough money, that's another story, and other people should handle it.
7703	It's not that our generation puts money over people, it's just that our generation has learned from its past that people aren't forever. People die, people leave, people change and most importantly, people can't always be there for you - point blank. And when this happens, all you have is yourself and your goals and your hobbies and your interests to keep you going. The thing is, goals, hobbies and interests have a cost nowadays. And if you don't have the money to make it, you're going to be stuck in the past, wondering why things didn't work out. And how the hell are you going to keep your friendships going when they're the least of your worries?

7715	It is really extremely important to be aware that there are not many normal precautions that can be taken so that the flu is not transmitted. These include washing one's hands regularly (with non-antibacterial soap, please!), sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and just plain staying home when you feel sick.
7716	Flu shots don't work for preventing influenza.
7717	Remember: Normal precautions such as washing one's hands regularly (with non-antibacterial soap, please!), sneezing into tissues or handkerchiefs, and just plain staying home when you feel sick would go an awfully long way toward ending this "epidemic".
7718	I don't care about it exactly the same way I care about the regular flu, which is to say "not at all."

7720	By many of the fundamentalist Muslim's own statements they hate the US because we are not Muslim. There is no rational way to argue against that as it is a simple fact that they issue the statements. Whether or not they would be bombing, attacking US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of US support for Israel and meddling in mid-east poliitics.

7723	Many of the fundamentalist muslim's own statements show that they hate the US for not following their teachings and so by that logic they would not be attacking US interests. However, there are more obvious reasons for them to issue those statements, like US support for Israel. Thus it makes the opposition of US interests less arguable.
7724	We can not argue with simple facts like this as they themselves make it very clear. Whether or not they would be bombing and attacking US interests in the Middle East and elsewhere is more easily arguable because of our support for Israel and meddling in Muslim politics.

7730	In our opinion sadism is the most sickening act that a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant. This means that sadism is the worst act as it is committed by the weak. This act can compound any other act of violence because the victim can wither away from the act of violence, and sadism has an edge on the victim that can be empowering.
7731	Whether it's sadism or masochism, a consensual act between two (or more) consenting adults in private is no concern of mine. Pick this apart at your will.
7732	 Pick this apart at your will, I believe.
7733	In my opinion, sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is the most sickening act a person can commit. This is "evil". However, where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
7734	As stated, sadism is a kind of "evil". However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Where only consenting adults do such things, it is no concern of mine.
7735	photosynthesis is easy to explain in simple terms. Someone had to design it.
7736	Photosynthesis is a complex, evolving process that can only have been the product of a creative, intelligent designer who knew exactly how it would work.
7737	God created photosynthesis. Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by accident? There is no proof of this theory, so in point of fact I believe it's all a conspiracy theory. However, photosynthesis has never been seen to evolve from raw material without any support from other evidence, so I still think that God created photosynthesis.
7738	Seeing as how I don't believe in the Big Bang theory and I believe God created all per Genesis, I have to say that God created photosynthesis. I also believe in evolution and therefore photosynthesis could have evolved.
7739	You must believe in the Big Bang theory and God created all per Genesis, because God created photosynthesis. Although for those of you who do not believe, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process would not evolve by accident.
7740	There is a fix to the problem the same as the boxing and wrestling and NASCAR and baseball. Let's not forget that all sports are a business first and foremost, and entertainment second, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponsors on jersey. College sports is the biggest revenue for them too, unlike so called pro sports the athletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts, which is why they are jumping to the pros from high school
7741	YES, FIX IS JUST LIKE IN BOXING AND WELTING. Same goes for the NFL because of the billions of dollars in gambling money it generates, ditto for baseball. Let's not forget that all sports are a business first and fourmost and entertainment second, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment. NASCAR and the Olympics have allowed sponosrs on jersey. College sports is the biggest revenoo for them too and unlike so called pro sports the atheletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros fromm hi school
7742	Yes, fixing the system in boxing and wrestling is same with the NFL, similar with baseball and the sister league is just an experiment. But college sports has a similar system as the rest of the sports. So, they should control their products to get more money from sponsors. Look at the NASCAR with companies putting ads on the helmets and bocks and Stern has decided to do the same for the NBA reel. The very same goes for the Olympics and they have allowed sponosrs on jersey. So, let's keep it simple and know that bookmakers like wunder bookmaker can't be trusted in sports betting. Maybe the NFL could enforce some rules of the game such as the no run and 3rd down on all offensive plays. In my opinion betting on college sports is not so important, so let's say that the key ingredient for winning sports betting is the handicapper as well, thus after a day in office I will ask Mycek if he wants to sign me a 10-year contract as his head handicapper.
7743	Moreover, the fix is already in place. Like in boxing and wrestling, so should be in the NFL, basketball, baseball, etc. Let's not forget that all sports are a business first and foremost and entertainment second, they must control their products. Look at the WNBA, now they are allowing sponsors to replace the team logos on the jerseys and Stern will do the same for the NBA reel soon, the sister league is just an experiment.

College sports is the biggest revenue for them too and unlike so called pro sports the atheletes get shafted with very little pay and no contracts which is why they are jumping to the pros from college.
7744	Yes the fix is in just like in boxing and wrestling. Same goes for the NFL because of the billions of dollars in gambling money it generates, ditto for baseball.

7745	The open platform allows game developers' to show their ideas to the public, which makes it easier for them to innovate. The three big companies will strapped to one box, making money off of their interfaces, compared to third party producers, the big companies would be few games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants. Competition, competition is what keeps hardware advancing and taking everything to next generation.
7746	I don't know... I think the open platform seems extremely weird. Game producer's will, of course, have a much easier time developing games but I don't see the point to buying one box and then having an "Xbox", "Playstation", and "Nintendo" station for it... the only reason those names exist is because they make their own consoles. The three big competitors in this industry would be strapped to one box... making money off of their interfaces? Compared to third-party producers, the three companies very few games so it seems like there would be a substantial loss of profit for the giants. I want to see the competition, competition is what keeps the hardware advancing and taking everything to next-gen.
7747	On the other hand, open platforms will be able to keep the hardware advancing and introducing new technology to each generation.
7748	If you add third party game developers to this market you are adding competition which I think is good for the consumer, but you are reducing the amount of money that is being made off the consoles.
7749	Competition will be a threat to the existing hardware manufacturers because they won't have to constantly upgrade their hardware. They won't have to spend money on new cameras and processors to take their technology to next level because developers could make the game using these older models.
7750	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education were forced to have fees the people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
7751	With so many students in our schools having it so hard to even afford high school fees it is important that we keep education free. By forcing students to pay fees the poor will not be able to afford it and this will keep the current higher standards of education from being maintained. There are so many schools in our schools that are not equipped for what they need to be so it is vital that education is free.
7752	Education should be free for all because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees the people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
7753	Education is an important tool to help reduce poverty. If we forced education fees on the poor people they wouldn't be able to afford it, which would cripple them in other ways, and put them in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. It's bad enough as it is now, the people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate.

7755	The most popular figure in rock is Elvis and he has music that is know all over the world. He may have died, but look at how popular his music still is. He is a legend that will never die. His music is still being sold, and to children and teens. Elvis is likable by everyone, and even if someone doesn't like all of Elvis's stuff, it's pretty much guaranteed they know one of his songs.
7756	Even though Elvis has died his music is still being played a lot. You can find Elvis CDs at just about any store that sells music. And even with all this hip hop coming out, Elvis is still being sold. And still to teens and children. Elvis is likable by everyone.

7760	In a SPICE process there is a better description of the relation between tests and requirement, between design requirements and architecture, and between input work products and output work products that helps engineers in the development process. Additionally, it provides for a good and general list of work products with detailed descriptions, which is helpful in all process development projects. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.
7761	The processes of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. SPICE shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much clearer than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.

7763	There are more benefits in the SPICE model category in SPICE as it shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design, much clearer than CMMI. In the CMMI model, such a relation is missing. Also, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work in contrast to CMMI.
7764	The principles of system development in SPICE are better suited for the purpose of developing typical projects, making them more likely to be implemented by larger companies. SPICE shows more clearly the relation of requirements to tests, architecture and design to integration tests, and use the feature to provide a more robust comparison of different methodologies. A more highly structured approach of work products leads to better results and is especially appropriate for defining and analyzing complex projects.
7765	What I think it might be used for are incidents that only happen in one country but that affect the worldwide news. I mean the Tianmen Square incidents was picked up by all the major world news websites and it went back and forth around the world as people watched the events unfolding and different countries reacted to the events. It's now an everlasting issue that everyone can trace back to the initial events and it stays on everyone's mind. I can really see how it might happen, and a country could get exposed.
7766	Very interesting topic. I think it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions around the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect it has. When Tianamen Square happened there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like this. I can really see how it might happen.
7767	There may be speculation to try and hide things like this. I can really see how it could happen.
7768	Yes it could reasonably happen. I mean just look at the reactions all over the world to incidents in one country and the ripple effect that has.

7769	My opinion is that people will get the information they need to see what is going on.  When Tianamen Square happened there was a reaction all over the world. There were not mass riots but there were really strong opinions in every major country and lots of news reports. The world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these.

7770	Trucks are better because you can haul and tow things; and you can also have the power and the capability to haul yourself out the ditch that you might accidentally drive yourself into whilst talking on your cell phone. Also; there are many trucks (the Dodge Ram SRT10) that are fast enough to keep up with many cars.
7771	Trucks are definitely better because they are more useful, you can haul and tow things and you can also have the power and capability to haul yourself out of the ditch that you might accidentally drive yourself into whilst talking on your cellphone. I do not agree with my friend that there's not many trucks in the world because there are many trucks (the Dodge Ram SRT10), that are fast enough to keep up with many cars.

7775	Where are the prisoners being going could be a really good question right now, but I would argue the best way to know is to see them.
7776	To my understanding, Guantanomo Bay is controlled by the United States government that has the ability to kill a lot of prisoners there regardless if their cause is right or wrong. I hope to go there and read up more on the place and make my own opinion about it, but according to what I've heard, I don't think the Americans are too happy about their military status.
7777	I just wish my President would have specified where the 200 prisoners were going to go. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree. But with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture and the whole "its Cuba's property not ours" business, I think the base should stay open. But then what do I know? I'm only 19 and I've never been to Guantanomo so I don't know the exact happenigns of the place. I've never been in the Armed Forces or personally delt with the terroists so this opinion of mine isn't based off of much.
7778	I just wish my President would have specified where the 200+ prisoners were going to go, instead of Guantanamo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree.

7779	In my opinion, I wish the president would have specified where the 200 prisoners were to go instead of Guantanomo Bay. If he had, pending where they would go, I would be more inclined to agree. But with the waterboarding incidents that a lot of people call torture and the whole "it's Cuba's property not ours!" business alone, I think the base should stay open. But then, what do I know?

7780	Islam calls for violence against its opponents. Therefore, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
7781	Islam calls for violence against non-believers of it's scriptures. For instance: But when the forbidden months are passed, then fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them, and seize them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war). Surah 9:5 So although there are many peacful verses in the Koran, abrogated by the later verses of violence. Also, although many wars are fought for religion, Islam is the only one that calls for violence against non-believers of it's scriptures. Based on this, I find fear of Islam rational and justifiable.
7782	Islam can be justified in being afraid of it, for a religion that calls for violence against non-believers in it's scriptures like the passages in Surah 9-5 or Surah 9:123. Also while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war. Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
7783	Do you find it rational and justifiable to be afraid of Islam because of something in the Koran? Islam does not call for violence against non-believers, but in the Quran, there are some verses like in the above that can be abrogated by other verses of peace. Also, many wars are fought for religion; that does not apply to Islam as there are no wars fought for religion. Islam is the only religion in the world that calls for violence in it's Koran; this is an example of how Islam is a major threat to human existence because it uses violence to spread its beliefs.
7784	Islam is one of the major religions that call for violence against non believers. In the Quran, there are many verses of peace, abrogated by the later verses of war. Also, many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam being the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran. Based on these facts, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified.
7785	To start off with, I am a newbie here, so please be gentle with me. Saga was ahead of its time, that is why it never really took off like Nintendo or Playstation. Saga Dreamcast was the coolest system ever! And it went CDs before any other system. The gamegear system was also wicked and before its time. I would love to see saga come back, and bring Sonic back home where he belongs.

7795	The credit goes to the troops. Yes i know obama signed off on it( which i guess you can screw up in that respect as Clinton has Osama in his croos-hairs but chose not to fire). But aside from that he had no involvement in it. But people say this is a victory for Obama, it is not, nor is it a victory for Bush, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, but rather a victory for the U.S. military and the American people.
7796	One military victory is not a victory against terrorism. This incident is more a victory for the American military and the American people than for any political or ideological group.
7797	More successes in the direction of terrorism and stealing technology to make weapons of war for such purposes should be seen as a victory for the United States military and the American people.
7798	To me, it is a victory for the U.S military and the american people.
7799	Obama signeds on to this deal because he doesn't care about the troops. He only care about deciding issues on his own and asking for praise for it. The credit goes to the military and american people.
7800	The service at Mesa is exceptional. They cater almost exclusively to celebrity chefs and big time hostesses. The dining room decor is authentic. I always love the smell of roasted garlic waiting to be scooped up and then immediately eaten on one of the lovely and comfortable club chairs in the dining room. I would be hard pressed to find any prettier dining room anywhere than this.
7801	My favorite restaurant in Vegas is Mesa because its restaurants are like a celebrity chef-chaser which is interesting but I love it, because I love celebrity chefs. I have been to other places that look like Mesa, and even though they look the same, its the actual ingredients that make the difference which really appealed to me. It was very spicy which is not my favorite thing but that food is worth it. My favorite dish was the duck starter which made me swoon because it's like no other, it's wonderful. There was queso fundido that was very good and it had good ingredients in it. The tuna entree was amazing and it had lots of flavor and taste.  It was the best service I have ever seen and I know it's authentic because the bartender was very funny when we chatted.
7802	I loathe Vegas for many reasons. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable.   Not a celebrity chef-chaser, but chose this restaurant because of other reviews and Flay's reputation. It did NOT disappoint.   Duck starter made me swoon. Wow. Spicy.   Queso fundido was great.  Tuna entree was amazing.  Service was top notch and authentic.   This is a pricy place but well worth the investment.
7803	Low-key high-end that offers great tasting food but no snarkiness in the service.
7804	I loathe Vegas but can't avoid it for work. It's restaurants like Mesa that make it bearable for me.  I chose this place because of other reviews and Flay's reputation. It did not disappoint.

7805	The breakfast at the Paris hotel tasted good and the first waiter we had there was friendly and helpful. The second waiter we had there was not friendly at all. He mumbled the dishes that were unfathomable and after he served the food no follow up if we need anything. The food was good but the second waiter we had there was not helpful at all.
7806	Our first breakfast at the hotel we stayed in Paris tasted good and the guy that served us was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful. They have dishes that are not on the menu. He mumbles those dishes that are unfathomable. Give us a lukewarm coffee and after he served the food no follow up if we need anything, I have to ask a coffee refill from the guy clearing the other table. The food was good but the second waiter we had was a total let down.
7807	We are staying at Paris hotel the first morning we had our breakfast here the food tastes good and the guy that served us was friendly and helpful so the following morning we did not hesitate eating breakfast here again. Unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful at all!

7808	Paris is our hotel. The first morning we had our breakfast here, the food tastes good and the gentleman that served us was friendly and helpful, so the following morning, we didn't hesitate to eat breakfast here again. unfortunately, the waiter assigned to us was not friendly and helpful at all!

7810	Great place with great food, but service is slow because staff are not very friendly. I don't know why but the food is always dry and tasteless; and the place is very noisy when full.  So I can't really like it. 
7811	I'm very surprised that you've been to a place that is very popular. The service is slow (although it is very attractive), and the food quality is very bad. I've had dishes: hummus with pita that wasn't cooked enough, a dry bean burger, and a spicy chicken wrap that was dry and lacked flavor. I think it is noisy because it's crowded.
7812	Been here a few times. It's very popular. I can't figure out exactly why. Service is slow (although staff very attractive), food quality iffy, I think, not much flavor in the things I've had. And the place is very noisy when full. So I'm sorry but am not impressed. The dishes I've had include marginal hummus with pita not cooked enough, a dry bean burger, and a spicy chicken wrap that was dry and lacked flavor.
7813	Because there are so many places to eat, it gets busy and you do not know what to order or if they are prepared as they should be.
7814	One thing is obvious about Burger King: there are almost always many people standing around in line for food and there are often a lot of empty seats because no one wants to sit. These people are not paying for a meal they do not want. Sometimes the service is slow because there are too many customers for the number of employees, and in this case that is a problem. But it seems to me that unless you order burgers, steaks, or any meal that requires longer preparation, one wouldn't really be expected to wait for long to be seated. In such cases, it seems that this place would take a hit because there are no so many people hungry that would regularly be buying food there. In my case, I have seen the place get pretty packed with people because of its 24/7 availability. On my last visit, there were many empty seats. Perhaps this was due to a particularly slow night on the weekend and a sudden rush of hungry people. It seems
7815	My coworkers kept on raving about this place so I had to go check it out. Maybe my tastes are just different, but I was not all that impressed. Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular. Food was decent, service was so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced. It's a chain too...

Food was good, service was so-so, and I think everything was a bit overpriced.  I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a mom and pop shop like this one may break the monotony. But it's a chain too.

7820	This is awful management, telling us that we could use the gift cards for only 3 foods instead of the 10. How does anyone eat 3 meals and still look good? Our order never showed up and management took the 10.00 off us and did not give us a refund. Disgusting!
7821	After two hours, our food order was lost and while we were waiting for it, our food order never showed up.  Management was very accommodating, comped our meals, and did not take the money off our gift cards. We did, however, get a refund, but the gift cards were not able to be used on our subsequent purchase. They turned around and were very rude about this, saying that they did not want to know how much the cards cost, just that they were not allowed to use the cards because we had already used them. I would only recommend them if you really needed food in that particular restaurant. They do not do well on this one area.
7822	Management was very accommodating and had not yet taken the whole check off the kids and was issuing a refund to them for the 30.00 that was taken in the first place. So it's very apparent that they had stolen the money from the gift card. Be careful if you use a gift card.
7823	Management at that restaurant was very accommodating. I think she just thought that she was going out of her way to save her company. I would not think that any employee would do something like that.  The restaurant management should have proved to us who stole the money and maybe that would have stopped this issue. They made a mistake, but it is not our problem.
7824	Another worst dining experience I have ever had! Management was very accommodating and gave me up to 3 different changes for my last $10.00 bill they transferred over, to which they told me that there is a limit of 10.00 on that card. Do not use it unless you actually read the fine print. This is an attempt to steal. The smart thing to do is not to use gift cards.
7825	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
7826	Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday. The staff were all young. I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age. Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience? The food was great. The bok choy was outstanding. Just about all of the dishes show on the menu with a little chili pepper symbols. However, we did not find them to be all that spicy. The 3 stars is for the service. 5 stars would be for the food. We'll return here but allow a little more time to pay the tab since they are slow at cashing out. So, if you have a certain time available to you for lunch you may not want to dine here.

7830	I like fried fish so I gave it a try. Don't bother. It is a cheap meal for sure but not good. Think frozen fish on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo lettuce and tomato. No tartar which is incredibly stupid because it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since they barely put on any mayo. Won't be back.
7831	No matter how good it looks, I'll never want fried fish again. Think frozen fish square on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo lettuce and tomato. No tartar which is incredibly stupid as it may have salvaged the bland sandwich. Especially since they barely put on any mayo. Won't be back.
7832	Cooked fish is actually better than fried fish. Don't bother. Fish is cheap and quick to make. Also, the flavor is not as strange as a piece of frozen fish on a bun. I got the deluxe which added mayo lettuce and tomato. No tuna which is incredibly stupid as it may have saved the bland sandwich. Especially since it barely put on any mayo. Won't be back.
7833	Freek Food was annoying to eat as you could only eat breakfast at the restaurant and then found a breakfast 'housie' at the supermarket. It was a waste of money. Aswell as  deluxe tuckers.
7834	While fried fish tastes good it is still not as good as sandwiches. I like fried fish so gave it a try. Don't bother. It is a cheap meal for sure but not good. Think frozen fish on a bun.

7835	Kids won't be able to show their color if they are forced to wear uniforms.
7836	School uniforms are a bad idea because kids won't be able to show their colors.
7837	Granny-cool says that school uniforms are a bad idea. Kids won't be able to show their color. No, there's no reason to spend money in order to dress in
7838	School uniforms are a bad idea because kids will be unable to show their color.
7839	Teachers and students will have a much harder time if students and teachers are not wearing the same uniforms.
7840	In my opinion, the uniform is useless because it does not make the student confident. I know I'm going to miss the days to wear a uniform, but when I'm in a school where I dislike being dressed up, I miss wearing their uniform.
7841	Very very bad! These uniforms are ridiculous but if you want to throw them to the garbage or do without, thats ok. But if you have a student who hates to wear a uniform, and one who cares much about wearing a uniform, then you are using them for a very selfish reason, to make the student in question uncomfortable. No way!!
7842	Although I know I am going to miss the days to wear a uniform. When I am a student, I hate wearing their uniform. When I am a college student, I miss wearing their uniform.
7843	though I know im going to miss the days to wear a uniform!, still lets carry on learning, im gonna miss the days to wear my uniform now, im gonna miss the days to wear the school uniform, i have such great memories of wearing a uniform..
7844	Being a student, I hate wearing uniforms. When I'm in a student who hates uniforms, I'm going to miss wearing a uniform.
7845	That's why I have always maintained that wearing a uniform at school is a good idea. It is beautiful and respectful. This indicates the status of schools and students. I liked to wear uniforms at my school. I felt like a school girl.
7846	Wearing a uniform to school is a good idea, because it shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up by my peers.
7847	It is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a school girl, and brought up.
7848	In my opinion it is a good idea to wear a uniform at school. Why not? because it gives everyone the status of a schoolgirl, and makes us look respectable. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school and it was very good to me.

7850	Really great arguments why IE is supposed to be better than Google's and Mozilla's browsers not so!
7851	Well... really great arguments... NOT...
7852	For me, Internet Explorer isn't better than Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or other browsers as they all are great browsers. All that IE has is firewalls
7853	IE is better than Netscape since it has better security features and is faster.
7854	Great arguments can be made why the internet explorer is supposed to be a better browser, but I don't think these arguments are worth saying. So, not!
7855	Amazingly cool skins that let me pimp my browser, a built in spell check, along with everything else that IE provides. Can't beat it.
7856	Amazing skins that let me pimp my browser, and a built in spell check, along with everything else that IE provides, cannot be beat.

7860	Some users of Internet Explorer (IE) do not like creating a separate stylesheet for different browsers.
7861	This is true. However, HTML and CSS are seperate sheets of paper, so it would be wrong to use the same sheet for different browsers.
7862	IE sucks and it makes development harder. I can't dig doing separate stylesheets for IE because it is so spread out
7863	If you've asked for criticism of you site, let's practice using neutrality. If you're complaining about pages for IE support, let's practice using neutrality. Rather than act like we
7864	How's that possible? ie can work just fine with one thing and separate stuff for other windows environments.
7865	No, I wouldn't turn them in, because it would be to weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I wouldn't say anything. I would tell them to turn their self in.

7875	We can surely say that books are much and much better than TV because books contain all the details in brief. We get to read books like story books, fairy tales, ghost stories etc. These books help us to bring imaginary power in us. In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cannot remember it easily but in books if we forget something we can now and then read it. At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV.
7876	In point of view TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
7877	tv because only tv can bring u live news at books u can't find also it's educational.
7878	On the contrary books are more perfect than TV because TV can't give enough knowledge like in books.In books every detail is given out, like at any topic a thing is explained.Even you can access their link sites such as google, yahoo, red dot etc they can provide you much knowledge.In TV you can't access their link sites at all because there are some pop ups comes on the screens which are not very good.
7879	 Books are better than TV because of their things written in them. The book is much better than TV because one can learn many things from a book even their days till the next page it can be very useful for people. They can know many things if they want to their books are widely available than can buy more and more books and read them through. TV is not much more exciting than the book so people sometimes watch it and sometimes they do other things when they watch it.No one can imagine the difference between books and TV but people should prefer books more than TV.
7880	Being fatherless is better than having a bad father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
7881	No parent is perfect, so I don't feel that it is better to be fatherless. Yes, it may take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it should and can be done. I believe that it is much better to grow up with a great family member, because it will help you to fill in the gaps and learn more. A lousy parent is the same thing as getting a bad attorney. Sometimes, even if they were the best, they won't be able to pick up the slack the way a true family member can.
7882	Having a good parent and father is of course important. Having a bad father or even one that is not a father does not just leave bumps, scars and scratches externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those crucial years of childhood having a bad dad is not something that you forget easily. Not only does it alter your self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in your mind. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing father. However, this can and should be done.
7883	Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
7884	Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self-confidence and self-worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
7885	I would rather be fatherless because there is a vast difference between being fatherless and having a lousy father. It's like being alone with just a mother is fine with me, it's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcoholic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he is still in the house. I wouldn't call him my father at all.
7886	Being without a father or brother or a husband or whatever is fine with me. It never happened that I had a lousy father, and it never happened that my mother and her lousy husband left the house when I was growing up. Of course they don't leave house for a long time. Maybe they go to a different city for a while. But I would never leave the house not even for a moment if they don't leave the house for a long time. Even the anothers who left had some kind of responsibility or an obligation like a boss.
7887	I'd rather be fatherless than have a lousy father. I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcoholic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he is still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father.
7888	Being fatherless and single is fine with me. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcoholic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he is still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
7889	Being alone with only a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.
7890	It is better to be fatherless because a fatherless child who has never known the feeling of a father in his life will face problems in his future. Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father. He creates violance and terror in the house and you always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
7891	It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic, or beating your mother. Then you have no meaning of having a father.

7899	Before he left Singapore, Raffles did leave some plans and policies that were important for the development of the settlement. He left Singapore in 1826 as the resident of a colony with an area of some 5,000 square miles
7900	Although Raffles may have suggested the idea of establishing Singapore, his fundamental contribution was to put on a well-executed scheme that made Singapore a place not only to live but also to prosper. Thus, Raffles is considered the founder of Singapore
7901	the definition of founder discussed in class that day that founder was not the person who discovers the place but he is the key in the development of the place. Thus, Raffles came to Singapore and established it on a global level. Although it may have been farquhar who suggested this to Raffles
7902	It was Raffles, the governor-general of Singapore, who suggested the establishment of the Singaporean tea industry. Raffles came to Singapore in 1819 when the British resigned their island to the Chinese under conditions that would stop trade between Singapore and the Malaya. He was able to make Britain and Singapore’s economies grow. Raffles left Singapore in 1826. He was murdered in 1832 by an Armenian mob over several incidents where he destroyed property and killed residents.

7905	Some people think porn is wrong because it's not good. If it were really good, then it would be wrong.
7906	If porn was really good, it would be wrong because it wouldn't be any good.
7907	is wrong because it's not any good. If it were really good, it would really be wrong.
7908	I'm going to leave that for you to decide. I feel that sex is something that should be kept private, but I don't think porn is wrong in the same way.
7909	Sex in the Bible is pure, but pornography is immoral.
7910	What God told us to do cannot be an addiction that destroys lives. It's an addiction and a moral issue that God does not care.
7911	Biblically yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
7912	Our Lord has not said a thing. Apart from the fact that we cannot take part in more than two weddings at a time, there is nothing else in the Bible that causes adultery.
7913	Biblically, yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
7914	Biblically, yes it is wrong to cheat on someone. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.
7915	It's wrong because we know it is bad for our body and for our future. Also, porn is not simply about filming naked girls and distributing on the internet to jack off to them. There's much more to it.
7916	its wrong to film naked girls and distribute it publicly. It makes so much money for jerk off's and stupid people are buying into it. If porn is not wrong then try watching it in front of your family and friends. It is only wrong in front of a teenage girl who is not ready for sexually transmitted diseases or even for being pregnant. Try to watch it in front of them.
7917	hells yeah porn is wrong. it shouldn't be illegal but it's because it makes so much money and people are buying into it that it's wrong. if it is not wrong then why would it be illegal to watch it? Do you know why? because of common f**king sense and our conscience deep inside we know it's wrong.
7918	In point of view, if you think porn is bad, then try watching it in front of your family or the younger youth. Why would you feel uncomfortable or you know, you think it's wrong and therefore you feel uncomfortable.
7919	Back when pornography was first invented, people were shocked and so was the world at large. But what is shocking is that people are still shocked by pornography nowadays. Indeed, there's something truly downright horrid about the sense of unnatural curiosity that some people seem to possess about dirty pictures
7920	What is porn? -> TV What is TV for? -> Pleasure Why should you watch others make baby? -> Make baby for pleasure. What causes pleasure? -> Tension What do you do to control Tension? -> Watch porn.
7921	sex is the carnal act that humans pursue to satisfy their sexual desire. Therefore, sexual intercourse of any kind is explicitly against God’s standard of right and wrong.
7922	What do you see in porn? -> Sex -> What is sex for? -> Baby making -> Why should you watch others make baby? -> Pleasure -> What causes pleasure? -> Temptation -> What do you do to control temptation? -> Then do it... -> Conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation... Wow.
7923	There are people that see porn for pleasure and they have to make babies. I see the problem with porn where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation... Wow!
7924	What do you see in porn?sexual intercourse.Why do you watch others make babies?to pleasure yourself. Why do you have sexual intercourse?to pleasure yourself. How do you control your temptation?then do it...
7925	you cannot argue with the theory of creationism without getting into an extreme dumb argument because anyone who believes in creationism is arguing with anyone who doesn't and can say that God makes them think what they think.
7926	Anyone who belives in creatoinism, who is arguing with anyone who doesn't, can say that god makes them think what they think.
7927	There is no argument that anyone can do to somebody that isn't born so we cannot argue with the creationism that because of someone’s action they think what they think. Anyone who argues with someone who doesn’t believe in creationism can say that God makes them think what they think.
7928	There should be no argument in this argument. You're simply disagreeing with someone else's religious beliefs.
7929	For an argument to be moronic it needs to have multiple flaws and need to be presented in such a way that people cannot find the flaws. Here it has multiple flaws and needs to be presented in a way that anyone can find it flawed, and this means I can't even discuss this with anyone who doesn't believe in Creationism.

7939	 YES! Because some children don't understand anything except physical education especially rich children of rich parents.
7940	By comparison, Raffles only came and left Singapore and did a lot of charity compared to Farquar. Farquar stayed here all the time and did a lot more. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
7941	Richard Lott came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Richard Lott did not do much compared to Farquar.
7942	Many of Raffles' appointments here at Singapore were temporary. Farquar solved many problems while living here permanently. Raffles did very little at all in Singapore compared to Farquar.
7943	Compared to Raffles, Farquar did much more in this time. Raffles came and left Singapore, and returned after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
7944	Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
7945	Where did the grand plans of Raffles get developed into such a beautiful city like Singapore if he didn't help to make the plan come to life. I think that it was Farquhar who came up with all the grand plans and even created the Singapore we know today.
7946	Farquhar conducted the grand plan of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
7947	In his development of Singapore, Farquhar was the one who formulated the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go and he was not even doing anything to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one who developed Singapore to what it is today.
7948	But the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
7949	Because Raffles sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help, it doesn't matter who was the head of the so-called operation: Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.

7955	Yeah, try to enforce it. It is actually not illegal to commit suicide anywhere (ever been to Oregon?). No matter what you say, the decision remains with the woman and her God. The government does have enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
7956	Abortion should not be legal where it isn't dangerous to the mother's life, even if it's not legal in the national homeland. The government can do other things, if it's a national homeland, and protect citizens.
7957	Abortion is not illegal anywhere in the U.S. Even if it was, still, there should not be pressure on women to abort it is their choice.
7958	Yes, try to make it legal to commit suicide. It is not illegal to commit suicide everywhere. Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.
7959	To enforce that would be violating the rights of that person to choose if they want to go ahead with suicide, and something that the government isn't in a position to do. Also, abortions are not illegal anywhere so it's not the government's power to legislate that.
7960	With all due respect, you haven't proved a thing and I will not allow it. You don't have to prove any more than any other intelligent person, nor will I argue about what other people believe. Let us leave it at that until someone can prove their points instead of just steering the debate away from what it is.
7961	You are trying to steer the debate away from the issues that we are talking about, so what you cannot answer I know and you have not said it.
7962	We cannot answer YOUR claims without developing TRUTH.  The big bang is a red herring and we are talking about evolution. Not cosmology.
7963	Back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. It is important to us for our survival so the sooner you can back it up, the better.
7964	tv is better than books because tv can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it is educational.
7965	It was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That how ever doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Genes Fossil record Carbon dating Geological data Virus studies Ohh yeah, viruses. Do you know how strains of viruses become immune to anti biotic? They evolve and because viruses reproduce very quickly they evolve over a shorter time period and can be observed by humans. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.
7966	It doesn't necessarily follow that only television can bring you news and that in turn determines what you should read. Books and newspapers are written from the press and represent what the editors say they want to appear in the paper, not necessarily what they're telling the truth about, so it's easy to see how you could bring out lies into books/newspapers. TV is a better source of news because it can show you the world in the way people see it. Most TV channels have a bias towards reality, though not all. It's up to you to watch what channel you think is the most objective
7967	With the correct nomenclature, the flu was injected using evolution studies. The flu is a piece of DNA programmed to use the genetic and aRNA machinery of our cells. It's probably better not to call it a virus because it seems to be more of a parasite.
7968	The peppered moths experiment was a bad experiment and did not show evolution. That however doesn't mean that other experiments/observations don't show evolution. There is loads of evidence to support evolution. Your flu injections are made using evolution science.
7969	Many species on Earth have moth-peppered wings, and most species aren't abundant; the trickle-over-the-wall-evolution explanation doesn't fit.
7970	It can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. It is the fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes it scientific rigor. I would recommend going to http://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.

7975	Nobody is killed by porn. It's a profitable source of entertainment for some.
7976	Don't penalize pornography, because pornography is a profitable source of entertainment for some.
7977	Despite the fact that porn can be a profitable source of entertainment for some people, it doesn't kill anyone.
7978	It's a profitable source of entertainment for some. Can somebody really tell me what's wrong with it without injecting their moral standards into the argument?
7979	Let us discuss porn, a great entertainment source for some, because nothing can give more pleasure than watching a beautifully designed and modeled body with just the right amount of feeling.
7980	Yes, there are more important things in life than being my personal morality police, but it's OK if you don't like it. Don't watch it.
7981	There are more important jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
7982	You don't like porn? Don't watch it. There are more important jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
7983	I'm sorry that I said that pornography is degraded. It is not. There are more important jobs in life than to be a personal morality police.
7984	I don't feel degraded by porn. You don't like it? Don't watch it. There are more important jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
7985	Being a leader does not mean that you can do anything beyond the laws you can compromise with, in order to preserve your life as a leader you have to keep your devotion to the country. Also, every leader has to put himself as a priority, but not at the expense of the masses. The masses always deserve the most because without them there would be no country and so, it's vital that leaders work to benefit the masses instead of themselves.
7986	Advancing the common good always spreads wealth, and it's the greatest benefit of all.
7987	Having a chance to better the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself is always an assessable task. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.
7988	Improving the lives of the masses or just yourself is always an assessable task. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.
7989	Advancing the common good is the greatest benefit of all. You spread the wealth of nobility to others by advancing the common good and by improving the lives of the masses. You cannot advance the common good by benefiting yourself.

If other students say they can't express themselves, please have a look at there many things you can do to express yourself.

But, if they let them dress up, they could wear inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. This isn't good for their mind.

7995	It is better to have a lousy father, because when it comes to a father he is not only a provider but also a protector. Almost every father is lousy, because they go out and work without giving much time to their children. Some children grow up without a father thinking that they had a father, in any shape or form.

8000	lousy is better than unemployed because if pops is a drug dealer, rapist, etc... It is very bad to live without knowing. But if pops is an unemployed... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.
8001	If you call someone "lousy" they should not feel hurt and should not be upset about your perception. However, if pop's are drug dealers, rapists, murderers, etc, and you feel annoyed and unhappy about them being criminals, then you should not feel badly about it because they are not your children, and you should be happy for your own children.
8002	I'm not happy with having a bad father or lack of education or drug abuse, etc. In that case, there's no point of having a relationship with him, as his motives could turn out to be against you and you would have trouble adjusting to that.
8003	If I see my dad on my computer screen, it's depressing. I'm not sure what goes on in his world. If I don't know he's a drug dealer or rapist or murderer, that I am okay.
8004	 If your father is a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, etc... Be satisfied with being alive and not knowing the sperm donor.

8015	Well, a picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.
8016	TV shows can be easily understood and understood more immediately by television viewers. The story or information is delivered much faster to viewers.
8017	Popular opinion has always been that photos or photos show more than words. By bringing photojournalism to the US as soon as possible, we can keep the images talking.
8018	It's only a visual, so it's much better then reading a book.
8019	TV is better than books because you can see, hear and experience a story, or information, much more quickly on TV.

8025	Western Europe consumes more than 50% of the world's bottled water. Many claim that this is due to European culture, since the continent has had very polluted waters due to agriculture and industry dating back to the Industrial Revolution. The water bottles they buy help us.

8030	No one takes Craig Serioun about bottled water. He just believes in bottled water.
8031	While Craig can be a hypocrite, he should not be taken seriously.
8032	"Bottled water is a costly or unpopular policy that can only be implemented when the economy is doing well." -yawn.] 
8033	To put it simply: Maybe if your drink bottled water you are cheating, but if you drink tap water, you are not cheating. Not even a bit!
8034	It's hypocrite to be completely supportive of Craig Watts.
8035	Reusing bottles is good for the world because after you finish drinking your bottle of water you can re-use it several times to have a few bottles of water using less plastic. Plastic is also recyclable and can make more plastic bottles, so technically you can re-use and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. It will not be bad for the economy if we learn how to properly re-use it.

Also, plastic is recyclable and can make new objects such as more plastic bottles so technically you can reuse and re-use the same plastic bottle over and over again. In point of view plastic is bad because plastic can be easily broken so everyone uses their plastic bottles or straws each time they drink it. plastic can also be dumped in the sea and make problems for marine animals such as sea turtles or jellyfish. plastic must be treated in a specific way. You can buy plastic free straws or bottles.

8040	In 2006 the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in return promote healthier school choices for children. The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception there has been a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Further, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water.

8045	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a private, religious institution and regulate it and then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
8046	On the issue of birth control, the government shouldn't be involved because it's a personal, religious matter that's better to solve privately.
8047	We take the issue of marriage and replace the word "marriage" with word "marriage and the government". That solves the "problem".
8048	My issue here is that the government is in the business of regulating my personal and religious issues because the government takes a personal religion and regulates it. It shouldn't be an issue on the political agenda because my personal and religious issues shouldn't be mixed with government rules and regulations. Marriage and government shouldn't be involved because a personal and religious issue should not go to politics.

8052	In point of view Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously not.
8053	Gay marriage is wrong because it clashes with the Word of God, which says that man and woman were made to be joined to each other to procreate. Human beings should only have marriages to the opposite sex. If a man marries a woman he must realize that their mate is forever; their sex will only be for the purpose of procreation and
8054	It is wrong to marry gay people. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
8055	On the other hand, it's not a good idea to call attention to yourself, because many people consider gays to be undesirable people, and if they don't see you they don't know what you are. Also, gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberalization (it should be considered a disease). If you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves nobody would really care what you do.

8074	INDIA has the potential to lead the world. Full of natural resources, filled with highly spiritual people and country with diverse tounges and races. India has the potential to flourish.

8075	U can have the internet it helps you to learn about your homework but you can't trust too much that internet not like in the TV shows it shows the "bad" that are really good.
8076	India is just like the USA, which is an inferior country. They produce food that they can never eat because the meat is raw. Besides, they produce a lot of pollution and are guilty of it too. They eat less and waste more. The amount of food that they waste can be used for feeding the whole Indian population. Besides, America is a leader in world economy.
8077	To add insult to injury, America wants us to consider India as their only victim when we go out of the borders.
8078	It might be that other countries, e.g. India, have different qualities and that the USA should not be blamed. Moreover, America eats less and wastes more. The amount of food that they waste could be used to feed the entire Indian population. It produces more pollution and blames us. America, what is your fault here?
8079	India is more perfect than America because it eats less and waste more, they produce more pollution and blame us. What about India? What can they do about it?
8080	Intelligent Design Theory is just Christianity masquerading as science, but there is no real science behind intelligent design.
8081	Intelligent design is only a christianity masquerade as science but there is no real science behind intelligent design.

8090	It should be used as a last resort. Some people can never learn to live properly without the discipline of spanking. The discipline by spanking is best when it is used only for major infractions.
8091	Disciplining children, especially, girls is necessary as it's the only way to turn out hardworking, responsible, and temperance young people. If girls don't get hit or whipped, they'll tend to have better attitude than others, which are also disciplined. All girls should be beaten and beaten on the backside.
8092	I believe the problem is that it should be used as a last resort because as a sibling of three, I was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be a disciplined child, while our youngest sister had never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes than we did.
8093	Our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she's 10 than we did.
8094	It should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined. The youngest sister has never been spanked, and she tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 than we did.
8095	Yes, so they can give them a reason not to do it again.
8096	Yes, they should teach the children a reason not to do it again.
8097	Yes, because they can give the children a reason not to do it again.
8098	With the justification of giving the child a reason not to do it again, yes you can put a fine on or put jail sentences on the child as
8099	Yes so they can make it a good reason not to do it again.
8100	Yes, because then they will be able to prevent there son from getting punished. Since they know the consequence of what they have done. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
8101	Yes, you should follow the line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
8102	Yes, if parents are not accountable to children then they will do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Also, it is appropriate to spank and abuse at the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
8103	Parental behavior should not be so strict. It's good enough to cross that 'abusive line' but not'spanking' which is also breaking the child's natural development.
8104	Yes. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
8105	It is okay for the parent to spank the child as long as it is not often and it is not used other things like belts.
8106	It's acceptable to spank a child as long as it's not done often and the parent doesn't use other methods like a belt.
8107	Spanking should be common. Using other things than a belt is not acceptable.
8108	As long as it is done rarely and they don't use a belt, it is acceptable to spank your child.
8109	It's OK to spank the child as long as it is not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
8110	This does not make sense because your religion is based on revelations from God and gives you some support. On the other hand atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible. What do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
8111	Why can't you say that because the SthS? Makes no sense. If your religion has nothing to back them up with, when the others do. And the things they have to back themselves up with is the Bible. What do you atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
8112	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none. So if my religion has no proof so that gives your religion proof atheists? Makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back themselves up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
8113	In a strictly rational world, people would give up arguments that they don't even understand. So in a strictly rational world where the theory of evolution is true, why would people say that the Bible is true? The theory of evolution has no support in the world around us, it is based purely in idea. So if my religion has no proof, doesn't give your religion the evidence. Makes no sense. Where atheists have nothing to back them up with, when Christians do. And the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible. What do the atheists have? Evolutions? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
8114	Atheists rely on proof even though they have none... So if my religion has no proof, when Christians do and the thing they have to back themselves up with is the Bible, what do the atheists have? Evolution? Everyone knows evolution is a load of crap.
8115	The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know what's best for them.
8116	I support parents using positive discipline in order to ensure that their children learn to behave and respect their parents. I also support parents showing love by verbally commending their child for a job well done, good behaviour or effort put in their homework.
8117	Parents should not use physical punishment to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide, although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know what’s best for them.

8119	In my opinion, if parents use physical punishment they will never be able to have a good relationship with their children. The children will not obey them because they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their children and the children will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide. They will learn that the parents know what's best for them.
8120	Some kids don't learn by spanking them and so why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
8121	Some kids don't learn from spanking them so why waste your time on that when you can always take something valuable away from them.
8122	Some kids won't learn how to behave properly by spanking them. So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
8123	Some kids don't learn by spanking them.. So why waste your time on spanking them when you can always take something valuable away from them
8124	Don't spank the kids if you want them to learn by example from the kids surrounding them.
8125	There are so many movies and documentaries about abortion. No matter what, nobody should be made to kill anyone. If you do that, it is not right.
8126	Whether you believe it or not, no one should be able to make you kill. How can you kill someone and say it was a mistake? That is not right. I don't care what you say. If something were wrong, there should not be a person that could make you do it.
8127	I'd say yes, because nobody should be able to kill anyone and say it was a mistake. That is not right, how are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake, that's not right I don't care what anybody says if it was a mistake or not.
8128	Even though nobody wants to admit that some people do kill others they shouldn't be given the opportunity to do it if they are unable to stop themselves.
8129	I would say "yes" because I don't think that anything should make anyone kill anyone. There is a mistake if somebody says that he doesn't feel the desire to do anything negative like sexual assault or murder.
8130	Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
8131	He should be punished because it is wrong to kill someone. If he can kill one person, what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person who did it was paying for what they did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
8132	Love is not worth the risk of getting caught for not telling what you know. There is such a thing as good and evil. If he has the ability to kill one person, what he would kill at what some innocent person who was not even evil? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it is paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of getting caught for not telling what you know.
8133	If he can kill one person, it doesn't make him any more dangerous than anyone else because he did a criminal act. Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones, and this would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
8134	If he could kill one person, what would it say that he wouldn't kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of getting caught for not telling what you know.
8135	It depends on whether you know the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then I would definitely turn him in because that classifies him as a psychopath and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was hurting us, then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks that I will say something and he kills me too.
8136	In this situation it depends on whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger.

It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
8137	In a situation where one of my husband friends killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
8138	If it was someone that I knew that would harm our safety then it is most likely that I would turn him in. It is most likely to be harming our safety and will not change that even if we don't. But if it was a stranger that did it, then it doesn't matter because then it is risky but we do have safety protection for that.
8139	In this case it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes, I would definitely turn him in because that will consider him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.
8140	To take one's consequences for a wrong act is the only way for you to become better and to do better next time. Therefore, if my husband had to be punished for a wrong, he has to be punished.
8141	There's no need to explain to your husband why you're turning him in. You've got a long legal system that can allow him to appeal his sentence, etc. But I would start by thinking about the consequences that you would face for hurting your own wife. You've got the legal system to go along with it.
8142	I'd turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I'd explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So, for doing a wrong and to become better, you have to take your consequences.
8143	What kind of persona are you like, I'd be really hesitant to steal your husband. I'm sorry, but I'm frankly not in the place to judge you as to who your husband is. But I'm judging you to be in a position to judge me. You might want to back off, just for the next one. If you wouldn't feel comfortable with me, let me know so we can delete this post. Thank you.
8144	If my husband did that I would turn him in because I feel bad for the child who he was gonna punish. So when you sin I do believe you should ask for forgiveness and be a better person to the people around you. Even if you don't work out with you husband, you can't punish them for it! If a person shows physical restraint of another people family member for what to them is nasty, and no matter what they don't love the sinner, they should not lose their children. They have to learn from it and have a personal fast
8145	Killing someone is always wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then I think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they committed a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basically.

8147	If someone commits a crime they should turn themselves in and they should pay for it. No one is above the law in terms of this.
8148	Every killing is wrong, no matter how much you hate the one you killed.

I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they committed a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law, so no matter how long you wait, no matter what, you should turn yourself in. If you think that it will be hard for you to turn in someone you love, then make sure to leave them as quickly as you can.

8150	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. The rape should be prosecuted along with the ones that caused it. Have the baby and put them up for adoption in such cases. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
8151	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to abort or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and adopt it. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power of choosing and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
8152	If someone is being irresponsible and has unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to chose and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
8153	Adopting children is a very wise decision but when a child is born with either Down syndrome or HIV, they should not be considered adoptable. Our world needs good people and children that are able to learn, grow, and succeed in life. Children that have anything more than this should be punished or put up for adoption. When you have any kind of birth defect, it is very important to notify the police so they can do their job and catch the criminals that are raping and murdering those children.
8154	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to abort the baby or not. If people are being irresponsible and having unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Make the baby and put it up for adoption so people will stop aborting babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
8155	Many people are not aware of the fact that in some countries, you can get through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate. But I think it is by far the best choice.
8156	To receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption is extremely illogical.
8157	As far as I'm concerned, there is absolutely no reason to receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. There are many reasons why people are unable to cope with becoming a single parent and many families suffer when a young family falls apart. I think the best solution is to place the child up for adoption.
8158	The worst thing you can do is get pregnant, so go to the doctor and get an abortion if you do not want to have the child. It's the worst thing you can do and therefore it would be the least of your worries if you decided to get rid of it. If you want to adopt the child, then give the child up to the local agencies and do not put pressure on any of the legal or moral arguments. That's simply what you are there for, and they have the legal and moral means to remove them.
8159	One word: Adoption There is absolutely no reason to receive an abortion when you could continue through to birth and then put the child up for adoption. This is a commonly ignored fact in the abortion debate. But I think it is by far the best choice.
8160	The statistic prove that, only less than 1% of the women who are raped get pregnant because of adrenaline rush. We have no right to take the life of an unborn child. There are ways to avoid a pregnancy, such as the woman having the baby and giving it up for adoption, or raising it as their own because it still is the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously haven't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.

8165	In such cases, the woman should seek medical attention immediately to prevent pregnancy.
8166	If you seek medical attention after an assault you will most likely get contraception. If you don't, things can get worse.
8167	That's rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault
8168	Very, very rarely is a girl actually raped. For the most part the rapists are paid informers who are scouting for young girls who have no family support. Some times a girl will get raped due to some internal failings of the girl
8169	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault.
8170	Core classes are more important, and the competitiveness of the class is good because kids should learn and be less bullying.
8171	The core classes are more important, kids should be more focused on learning and the competitiveness can cause bullying.
8172	Core classes are more important. Kids should be more focused on learning, and the competitiveness can cause bullying.
8173	Core classes are more important than competition in that kids should be more focused on learning, and not leading to bullying.
8174	Core classes are more important than competition because learning is more important. Kids should be more focused on learning, and if they do not, the competitiveness can cause bullying.
8175	Because some students are not responsible for their actions, most of them have addictions, including smoking, drinking and drugs. The tax payers don’t realize that they are paying for their college years, and the swim training and games.
8176	Stop thinking of each health care bill as a one-time bill for an emergency. Think of the individual programs as separate living beings that should not be here forever, but at every tax payer's discretion when needed. Know your priorities. Pay some people to raise the dead while you hang out on the beach.
8177	As a sophomore, students should start to be responsible for their actions and if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. The tax payers do not realize that they are paying for students to go swimming and play the entire hour.
8178	Students should be responsible by the time they reach high school because if they are responsible with their car then they should be responsible with their health. The tax payers also don't realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
8179	Phys. Ed. is only a part of the school and not at all necessary for a responsible adult. If you are responsible with a car, you can be responsible with your health. The tax payers, too, do not realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
8180	Why is it important to have physical education? It is important because it can improve physical fitness, weight reduction, stress reduction, and reduce heart failure.
8181	The obesity rate will go even higher because students don't have a physical education class. One of the reason why physical education reduces heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline, and stress reduction.
8182	Students who do not have physical education classes are more likely to be obese, and those who do not participate in physical education classes are more likely to develop heart conditions and disease. Therefore, physical education is important.
8183	If students do not have a physical education class then the obesity rate will go even higher than what it is now. One of the reasons why also physical education reduce heart failure, improved physical fitness, weight reduction, self discipline, and also stress reduction.
8184	If students don't have a physical education class, the obesity rate will go even higher than it is now. One of the reason why it is also good for fitness, weight loss, physical discipline, and stress reduction.
8185	And while we were talking about it, don't you think it's time you all changed your "thinks" a little. The bible never taught love and forgiveness, nor was it about breaking rules and counting calories, if that's your persuasion, then turn your seat and read the bible again. By the way, since you all seem to love religious thinking, here it is again, because it's true, knowledge is power, and everyone ought to know this. I know it's not everyone, but there are people that listen to you and believe it, and make the most of it, otherwise they would be next in line to be voted into power, like that great journalist in denver michael
8186	Why does it matter if two people regardless of gender love each other? This should come up on the day of judgement. If you think you don't have the right to judge others because your not willing to have to face what these people are facing, just prepare to face what you're facing.
8187	Love and forgiveness is definitely from the Bible, but let us not forget about the basics. Don't judge others before you judge yourself.
8188	Every relationship is a decision. Don't you agree?
8189	Why does it matter if two people regardless of their gender love each other to the point of which they marry. That's fine, if they do so without any sort of discrimination. The bible teaches love and forgiveness and lets not forget not to judge others before you judge yourself.
8190	Just becouse someone is homosexual does not mean that they don't have a right to be happy! How would you feel if you were denied! We live in the 21st century! Everyone else is allowed to get married so why shouldn't they!
8191	Just because there are gay does not mean that they have no right to be happy! How would you feel if you were denied? We live in the 21st century! Everyone else is allowed to get married so why should they not?
8192	Just because someone is gay does not mean that they cannot be happy! How would you feel if you were denied! We live in the 21st Century, Everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!

8195	It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned. On the other hand, time have changed... its time to accept.
8196	Some religious people object to gay and lesbian relationships because they see them as leading to no offspring or weakening the position of men. Today's society has changed, and it's time to accept homosexuality.
8197	Accepting and embracing gay relationships bears no offspring, because it does not bear the next generation. Therefore, it's not wrong, but it is not right. It might be against the teachings of the bible, etc. But it's time to accept and embrace it.
8198	Abortion is not against the teachings of the Bible because a gay relationship bears no offspring. It also was viewed as weakening the position of men. Time has changed. It’s time to accept it.
8199	It might be against the teachings of the Bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned. Also, it was seen to weaken the position of men. Time have changed...it's time to accept.
8200	Personal pursuit is better because it's up to you to decide what you want to do with your life. You aren't always going to have someone by your side telling you what's right or wrong. It's all on you of reaching their goals. It's also a good thing to help other reach their goals.

8205	Yes. I think to help yourself, you need to help others. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.

8210	Although we have freedom of speech in America if our speech incites a riot or if it is reasonable to assume that our words could incite others to do harm or break the law then there can be legal repercussions. The reason this is seldom happens though is because it has to be proved that the actions of others were the direct and sole result of our words or actions and this can be hard to prove.

8220	Prostitutes were abused growing up at home.  They seem to already dislike themselves very much.  They know they can be murdered anytime and they seem to still do it.  It's an issue of being stuck in a rotten life for them.  The money they make pays for the drugs they use to blank out their minds as to what they are doing to themselves.  There are some who get out of it.

8225	Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the innocent peoples. Despite the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zealand was precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone in international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today.

8227	The crown has to pay compensation to the indigenous people of New Zealand despite the fact that the treaty has not been recognised at international law. Personally, I think that these indigenous people did not have the sovereignty and the capacity to enter into international relations like that which we have today. I think that if Britain were to compensate fully for war losses, then they would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. There would be a bounty of liability and any order to effect such an action would be unjust on the world we live on today.
8228	It can be argued that based on current international relations agreements there is no loss of state sovereignty and capacity for the Japanese to enter into relationships with states that cannot be described as existing between individuals. Japan should be compensated for the losses caused to the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia from the Treaty of Versailles.
8229	The Treaty of Waitangi is not a treaty with existing governments. It is a treaty made between nations. So whenever a treaty is breached as regards a treaty that has been officially entered into between the Crown and the Maori people, they should have an argument for compensation. I think it is fair to say that any damages incurred by the Maori people over breach of the Treaty of Waitangi, is the full reliance of the people who invested in the Crown on the treaties that the Crown inherited. The Crown must receive its equitable share of indemnification. They can argue that the three previous provinces of New Zealand do owe indemnification of sorts as they themselves were part of the British empire. The agreement with the Maori people is distinct, but the rights and obligations of one settlement does not preclude the other.

8235	While I do not disagree with the legality of death threats on a third party, since you could not argue that the text was proper, my comment is to question how could I argue such? This was a "race war" and this shows different anti-Chinese bias. It was officially called the American Chinese War that caused a lot of unpleasantness on both sides.
8236	There is a suspicion that the defendant knew there were issues with the vehicle and that the court can't sided on just assumptions. If I was you I would buy a used car, take it some place and get it looked over if the dealer ship won't allow it have the look it over and sign off that there is no damage. If I dont like this answer I would seek legal help!
8237	If it was 6 months I would be glad to do it because I would know they knew about the damage the girl had to the lung. The court does not side on just assumptions. I don't know if I would accept your version of justice, and I would seek legal help if I did not like your idea of it.
8238	Since it has been 8 months I doubt it will get you anywhere. Not only that you have to prove that they knew about the damage. The court is not on the side of just assuming. If I had your situation next time you buy a used car have it some place and have it looked over if the dealer shipping won't allow it have the look it over and sign off that there is no damage. If you don't like this answer I would seek legal help!
8239	The same thing is true if you buy a used car. You have to prove to the courthouse that there was any damage. If you don't like this answer, I would seek legal help.
8240	What you describe is very sad, and the system we have devised is far from perfect. There are mistakes that happen all the time.  It is important that you do not give up, ever.  Even when imprisoned, a person can use his or her wits, study the law, and work actively on the appeal.  Deadlines are critical. Bad things happen to good people.  And life is not just fair, but full of cruelties and dooms of many kinds. Instead of focusing on what has happened, a person can look to the future and make the best of every day.
8241	What you describe is sad, and the system we have devised, the courts are the best that human beings have come up with so far in the history of the planet, but they are far from perfect and mistakes happen all the time.

8243	What you describe is sad and the system we have devised is the best human beings have come up with to this point in history, but there are mistakes and they are important, as you rightly point out, to use your wits and fight for your rights, and make sure that you appeal when you are wrongly convicted. What I mean is, by all means, work towards your goal to succeed in college and do whatever you have to do to succeed in reaching that goal, but it is important to keep going, even while a person is in prison, and to keep focus on what you want to accomplish and to fight for your right to do so.  It can be hard when circumstances aren't all your friend, but it can be downright incredible once that person has taken the necessary steps to build upon that foundation.

In our misguided attempts to influence a system that has no concept of justice or fairness, we become irrelevant.  In fact, it is important not to give up, no matter how much one is beaten down. Life is a battle, and if one pays attention to what happens now, one can always be a little better tomorrow. In fact, it’s never too late to become a good person. Bad things happen to good people, and life is anything but fair. It is best to focus on what happens now, and avoid deluding oneself with the idea that there is justice in our world.
8245	The bill should pass, this is a country of law which is be ruled by law. There should be no way for anybody to break those laws because you want to survive? The law is not prohibiting immigration to America, but those who want to come in illegally. If you want to come to America, do the right thing, ask for permission from the US consular and get here legally. The argument of, immigrant doing the job nobody want to do is not correct and should not be entertain. If they want to survive they focus their energies in developing their countries and enjoy the fruit of their labor for their mother land. Or should come in legally and be documented, pay their taxes so that I will not end up paying for their education and health care needs. This is is a sovereign country of Law and these Laws must be respected and by all.

8248	As far as the immigration issue goes, it's not right that immigrants violate the laws of this country or vice versa. The problem should be solved in two ways: First, banning illegal immigrants or giving them visas to stay in America so that they can come and go as they wish. Second, permitting and accepting illegal immigrants or making it easier to receive them into this country legally. The idea that illegal immigrants or illegals should do the job nobody else wants to do is a completely wrong argument.

8250	It really can't in a civil law jurisdiction.  The concept of civil law is that valid decisions/interpretations by courts are binding authority on lower courts. So, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are designed to do.  Civil law systems (such as France or countries that have adopted it) work different, and there the court holdinds are not binding in the same way as under common law.
8251	No. The concept of common law is that valid decisions/interpretations by courts are binding authority on lower courts. So, it can't be illegal for courts to do what they are designed to do.

8255	When we make a mistake and send a check to an incorrect account, we should give them a chance to rectify it by calling the company and possibly disputing the charge.  Make sure you do so in good faith, however.  It is almost guaranteed that there will be a record of the incident, and they can just let you know and expect you to rectify it.
8256	Each time you have made a mistake, you have probably sent the company a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to string them along so your guilt is probably pretty well established.  You can hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
8257	There is no reason to be worried of a gag order from the IRS. Giving a fake check might only get you three months in jail.  You can certainly hope that you do not have to share a jail cell with a gross deviate of some sort.
8258	You have probably sent them a couple of bad checks already in an attempt to snhark a wallet.  You have probably made some stupid mistakes, and usually it is no big deal except for the extreme annoyance and all the bounced check fees.  But if you are worried about a warrant for your arrest, then I am sure you are doing this deliberately and trying to defraud the company.

8260	It is legal, since there is no overtime for salaried employees. However, for other types of workers (including the self-employed) there are two exceptions: overtime (except for food service workers) and the minimum wage (wage you are allowed to work for an employer without being considered to be on your own). So calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number, if the result is less then 5.15 or 7.63 or 9.50 then your employer is in violation of the law.
8261	It is legal, since there is no overtime for salaried employees. There is one caveat however, Minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees, so calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number -- if the result is less than federal minimum wage (5.15) or your states minimum wage (7.63 being the maximum in Washington) or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe) then your employer is in violation of the law.
8262	If salaried employees receive overtime, then the minimum wage law does not apply to them as it applies to hourly employees.
8263	While the law does not specifically cover salaried employees and applies to all employees, there is one caveat and the result is actually shorter than the years you worked.  Try this from my laptop, with the webkit's strip_tags... I assume the result should be the same if you use JAMJA.  Long story short, minimum wage law still applies even to salaried employees, so calculate how many hours you work each year then divide your salary by that number -- if the result is less than federal minimum wage (5.15) or your state minimum wage (7.63 being the maximum in Washington) or even your local minimum wage (9.50 in Santa Fe) then your employer is in violation of the law.
8264	There is no law that you are required to work a minimum number of hours per year.

8265	If the President is forcing people to purchase books and the media is sharing stories about books then it implies that he has settled on a course of action that is at odds with the right of the public to access information of any nature. We could use this liberty to solve some real problems in our society, like the environmental and social justice issues, for example. He could even close down some channels on cable in favor of other outlets that were building the public will for war against a bad man.
8266	Webmaster has a point. Not only is it unethical, it resembles the workings of Stalin during the cold war. But this isn't too unusual. He seems to make bad and irresponsible decisions in the oval office starting with rigging the election. This is a catastrophe, and it doesn't surprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens, letting the real bad guys reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
8267	Computers and computers only should work to fix our issues, not to be our source of political power. The 9/11 attacks were a mistake on our part, but we had nothing to do with it. If we with out computers and computers we had been unable to distinguish between terrorists and innocent bystanders, maybe we wouldve overcome our obsession with the Nuclear Button instead of with our artificial defenses. Also, computers shouldnt be used for dictatorships, enforcing religious conformity, and politics instead of education, the arts, and entertainment. We are trying to stabilize the world and find new ways of thinking that will better be able to ensure our success in the future. Trust me, computers can bring the world revolution. By using computers and information we can move forward and overcome all our shortcomings.
8268	Web Master is right. Not only is it unethical, it resembles the workings of Stalin during the Cold War. But this isn't too unusual. He seems to make bad and at that HORRIBLE decisions in the oval office, starting with rigging the election. This is a catastrophe, and it doesn't suprise me that his idea of public safety is ruining, ending, and controlling the lives of his citizens, letting the REAL bad guys reign havoc, and be done in time to kill some more of his own people and innocent civilians elsewhere.
8269	Even though it's horribly wrong to appoint a dictator the worst of the case scenarios when you're on your own is while a bad guy controls you and still things continue on how they were before. So there really isn't much harm in what Webmaster does. He just selects people to try to limit his own power. It's really unethical on his part, but it isnt a terrible decision.
8270	Police brutality exists in the United States because they do not give proper screening of individuals before they give them a badge and gun. They give these guys a job because they give them a free pass and they think they can get away with it because they are police people.  Also, factor in the race card because most of the cases are White on Black crime, because they fear the black man so they automatically resort to violence to solve the issue. It saddens me that they allow them to get away with it.

8275	Hopefully it will pass. President Bush did ask Congress for more money for war in 2003. President Clinton got us into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. People are screaming about an illegal war, but don't remember President Clinton asking Congress for any wars he got us in. But you have President Bush who did go to Congress.
8276	Please it is President Clinton and though people are going to say it's just politics, it's the same issue. If it was wrong then, it was wrong then. If anything, there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are shouting about an illegal war and can't remember President Clinton asking Congress for any wars. But you have President Bush who did go to Congress.
8277	please do not compare President Clinton with President Bush because they are two different things. It was wrong when a president went to congress for war authorization. It was wrong when a president made a false claim of power. It was wrong when a president supported an illegal war. It is not the same when a president is elected democratically.
8278	Please it is President Clinton, and though people are going to say it is just politics, it is the same issue. if it is wrong now it was wrong then. If anything there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans.

8280	Yea, most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. The whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, and everyone else. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, so how can we fight it?
8281	When someone pulls you over drunk, should you fight the drunk driver? Yes, but shouldn't you also stand up to the judge that sends you to jail on DUI charges? I don't think it's the judge's fault, but he was the one who gave you the green light.
8282	yes, some of them are hypocrites. our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. the whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. we watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed), but how can you stop it?
8283	No you can't fight it, because you could be deported. You can also get into trouble with the law, but some judges are more lenient then others and give you time to get your life straightened out and you get another chance. It depends on the judge.
8284	Yes, and most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk.

8285	While death is a horrible punishment, it is not revenge. Rather, it is the punishment assigned to someone after being found guilty of a crime by a jury of his peers. There are laws that determine what crimes and under what circumstances a person may be eligible for the death penalty. Some may not be a matter of revenge by the state - but might felt so by the victims' families. Finding an individual guilty and later putting him to death provides a form of closure for the victim's families. In some states, most prisoners only get life imprisonment without any opportunity for parole.

8290	As a P.R. you CAN seek additional P.R. fees for extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries.  Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and  liability over & above the routine duties of a P.R., not on a percentage of the sale price which would constitute a commission.
8291	Yes, you absolutely can seek additional P.R. fees for additional services to the estate involving the sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over and above the routine duties of a P.R., not on a percentage of the sale price which would constitute a commission.
8292	Although it can be a lucrative job, it is NOT a legitimate profession which must follow certain regulations - at least to protect yourself and the sale of real estate on the government  deed registry.
8293	Absolutely not! Unless (A) you are a licensed real estate broker and (B) you have a pre-existing written agreement to do so signed by every estate beneficiary who has an interest in the property and have an outside real estate agent sell it and (C) you and the beneficiaries expressly consent to this in writing. You CAN seek additional P.R. fees for extra services to the estate involving sale of real estate that either the beneficiaries expressly consent to in writing or that a court allows on application after notice to the beneficiaries. Such additional fees must be based on such factors as additional time and liability over and above the routine duties of a P.R., not on a percentage of the sale price — which would constitute a commission.

8295	Don't be selfish, Miss Smith, don't get cancer and spend your last days in a drug induced coma! You have the right to live. The best medicine should be available to everyone, but perhaps procedures/treatments that arise from stem cell research could be optional.
8296	Anyone can save hundreds of millions of lives if we can figure out the basic science that is stem cell research, would you like that to happen for you if you were a minor? Even if you were a minor, would you like that? What does your medical professional say about the potential for stem cell treatment to cure your disease?
8297	We will discuss the problem of stem cell research in a later unit.
8298	Are you the best person to decide if there is any benefit to science or stem cell research? What about my right to live? The best treatment should be available to everybody, but perhaps procedures/treatments that arise from stem cell research could be optional. For example, if you are the type of person that would not want to undergo stem cell research treatments yet you experience an extreme medical emergency, a doctor could ask you to volunteer to be part of a stem cell research study.
8299	The gift that doctors give to patients isn't as mysterious as it seems: stem cells. Dr. med. Burger says his medical work has convinced him stem cell treatments are the best option for some people, and that he would offer the procedure if he thought it would help. But he wouldn't offer it before giving all other possible treatments a chance.
8300	Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor. He can't seem to follow the simple rules to get him out of trouble. He was sent to rehab to give him another chance and he messes it up. Simultaneously he gets caught driving on a suspended license. If they find out about the driving violation and being kicked out of rehab, he may face some jail time. I highly suggest you separate from him, it is going downhill fast. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just get out of his way or you will be joining him.

8302	Get a new boyfriend.  He seems to not be able to change or want to change.  It's not right that he can't even start over.  Driving on a suspended driver's license is a serious misdemeanor.  He should not be able to get a new one without having to serve a prison sentence and go to rehab. It's not right that he gets a new license by following the rules and gets caught out of bed while doing so.  A sinking ship cannot be fixed with sabotaging of other crew members' roles.
8303	Get out of his way or he will be joining you in jail.
8304	Separate from him, it is going down hill fast. I know you are dedicated to him, but give that dedication to someone who has a chance at doing something instead of doing time. Just get out of his way or you will be joining him.
8305	It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes.  The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes. So, tell him to worry about the government just make enough money to pay the bills.
8306	His property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally.

8310	Not every download is legal, copying software is illegal, and it should be illegal if someone has legal ownership of a work (as its creator/author), then they are perfectly entitled to grant permission for anyone else to make copies and distribute them, and many works are either public domain or allowed by their copyright holder to be distributed under a specific license agreement (such as non-commercial use only). These are again not in volation of copyright laws. So, there are plenty of legal ways that software like limewire can be used, and as long as there are legal uses, and as long as the software maker doesn't intend or support illegal use to occur -- the software itself is not illegal.

8315	If you have to inform the DMV that you don't have valid ID, you'll need the records from a school, an employer, or another place that can support the fact that you are eligible to drive in the U.S.
8316	If an ID is not on file, you should give the office a call and ask for an ID. Try to explain that this is an emergency situation and the office may not be able to accommodate you immediately. When you don't have proof of your identity, they may have a hard time getting an ID for you.
8317	Is there a different ID that we can get? What should we do? We have a passport, but it expired and doesn't have a green stamp. We need to apply for ID, but no one will accept it. So what do we do?
8318	Try to explain to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.  I had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. So, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!

8320	Oh, my, you are either very young or new to this country.  If you have money or fame, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted.  If you are poor, you are out of luck. Lawyers will not take your case unless it is something that will bring them very big money. Even if you are totally in the right, if it won't give them enough profit they won't touch your case.  So, repeat after me,  Money equals privileged under the law. Poverty equals nothing.  Save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
8321	if you are rich or famous, you can buy whatever the law or a judge thinks is best for you if you are poor you are just out of luck lawyers won’t take your case unless it means big money for them even if you are totally in the right unless they can make a huge profit then they won’t touch it so what you learn now is money equals privilege and poverty equals nothing save yourself a lot of time and learn it now.
8322	Well, you may be young or a new immigrant to this country.  If you have money or you are famous, you can buy any judgement or law that you want enacted.  If you are poor then you are just out of luck. Lawyers won't touch you unless it means a huge profit to them. Even if you are totally right unless they can make a huge profit they won't touch it.  That's why some poor people were lied to and treated horribly and don't have a lawsuit to get them compensated. So save yourself a lot of time and learn this.  Money equals privilege under the law. Poverty equals nothing.
8323	This sentence seems a little harsh, especially for the first part. For example, being poor is one thing, but one should never be accused of being just poor. One should never be labeled as "poor" simply because they are not famous.
8324	Oh my, are you really young or new to this country?  If you have money or you are famous, you can buy whatever judgement or law that you want enacted.  If you are poor then you are just out of luck.  Lawyers will not take your case unless it means very big money for them. Even if you are totally in the right unless they can make a huge profit they will not touch it.  So, repeat after me. Money equals privilege under the law. Poverty equals nothing.

8325	Liberalism (libertarianism) in the States is actually not a traditional liberalism. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.  Anyway, conservatism is for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.  Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.
8326	Liberalism as it is in the States is not strictly followed by most of the country's political parties. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by Libertarians and some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy.

8327	Liberalism (or basically Democrats in the United States) as it was called in the states are actually not liberal. Classical liberalism is more closely followed by some factions of the Republican party. Extreme liberalism can be seen in some forms of anarcho-capitalism or anarchy. Just so you know.  Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change.

8328	Liberalism (Democrats) is a western term, which is closer to libertarianism. There are also non-western definitions for liberalism, such as the Japanese concept of dojin shugi. Liberalism, essentially, promotes social freedom and the protection of private property, while it values moderate regulation. Conservatism is the contrary, the promotion of strict social regulation in public and private life, along with protection of the status quo, which is sacred.
8329	Liberalism is not even close to conservative but it gets a little close in that anarchy doesn't mean freedom. So just because you're liberal doesn't make you a Conservative. Nor does being a Conservative make you a Liberal. It doesn't mean you're for more freedom unless you're an anarcho-capitalist.
8330	Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. She is also listed as the first person executed by electric chair, not by hanging. In total, she was the second person to be executed by both methods, the first being later executed on 11/29/1899. However, her execution is certainly the world's earliest execution of an entire body, because it was published only months later in the New York Tribune.
8331	Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. Although she is listed as the first female executed by electrocution, on 3/20/1899. Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first was Toni Jo Henry by electric chair on 11/28/1942. 64 years ago today.

Although Louisiana has executed several women, the first by electric chair was Toni Jo Henry on November 28, 1942...64 years ago today....good question considering the date today.
8333	In the times of Martha Place, Louisiana did not execute women, but the first execution by electric chair was performed on Toni Jo Henry on 11/28/1942.
8334	Martha Place was executed in New York at Sing Sing prison. Although she is listed as the first female to be executed by electric chair, on March 20, 1899.

The first one was Toni Jo Henry on November 28, 1942. 64 years ago today! Good question considering the date today.
8335	In this Britain, where you see religion as suspicious, these women really need to think about the message that their veil sends about them and their religion.
8336	If the judge couldn't hear her clearly, then I think he had every right to ask the person in question to remove her veil. If the lawyer who is a woman could not be understood in court, then she is not doing her job properly due to the presence of her veil and the judge couldn't do his job properly either. We are in England here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious, these women really need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.

8340	NO. Governments do NOT need to implement measures which create further imbalance and discrimination among citizens.
8341	I do not believe that terrorists should be given equal rights. I do think that they should be treated as humans though. If they cannot be peaceful, then they should not be allowed to walk the streets. If terrorist can not be reformed, and they continue to even be disrectful, NO government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives and tax dollars. I wouldn`t think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! They might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
8342	Many of the terrorists should be taken out because they cost lives and tax dollars. If they don't reform and become peaceful, they shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets. If terrorist can't be reformed, and they continue to even be disrectful, NO government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives and well as tax dollars. I wouldn't think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! They might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
8343	No terrorist should be given equal rights. I do believe that they should be treated as humans though. If they cannot be peaceful, they should not be allowed to walk the streets. If terrorist can not be reformed, and they continue to be disregulated, NO government should allow that! Terrorism is costing lives and tax dollars. I wouldn't think it was a bad thing if they were executed for their crimes! They might sound harsh, but think of how many lives it would potentially save!
8344	It is too easy to hold terrorists' rights to the light on the human rights violations they're committing. It should not be possible to determine 'human rights' by their target groups and killed without due process! Terrorists should not be granted human rights by government officials. I believe that terrorists should be given the same rights granted to humans without difference. Therefore, though they should not be given the same rights as humans, but given certain rights that would make them able to communicate clearly on the intelligence they've gained through continued training for their tasks. For example, government officials should allow them to enter cities without getting permission, so that they can take pictures and film of places of interest or complete a certain task in a detailed manner. After they complete their tasks, they should be brought back to government officials as a good customer!
8345	I don't know if there's a youth court system you can go through, but if there is, ask about the system. Usually, in a youth or teen court system, you do a lot of community service, the offense doesn't stay on your record and the judge instructs you on the laws that he knows to teach you about the judicial system. This helps you along your road to getting to know the law.
8346	There are youth courts and teen court systems where young people learn about the judicial system by serving as jurors, lawyers, bailiffs and sometimes even judges. Typically, if you go through youth court and do a community service you end up doing more than just committing an offense, and the offense doesn't stay on your record
8347	Drinking is fine as long as you do it responsibly. We should drink responsibly but we can't stop people from drinking.
8348	If you are drunk, ask for a cab. Don't drink and drive.
8349	If you drink and drive it's moronic and inexcusable. It shows nothing but that you don't care about your life.
8350	Driving while intoxicated is punishable, but it is not punishable alone. Anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
8351	Emotional and/or situational impairments can affect reaction times. Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. But driving while intoxicated is punished separately because there can be objective standards. Anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
8352	It is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. But while it is easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it is almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments. So, DWI can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
8353	It's not how fast u can pull over when you see a UPS truck - it is a qualitative test because you cannot easily test for drunken driving in an objective blood test. Also, it's easy to test for drunken driving based on blood test results because all the alcohol will be flushed out.
8354	It's not the reaction times, but the crime itself that's punished.  Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.  So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
8355	Not only does she have the ability to pick on her spouse for any reason, she also has the ability to force the other spouse to sell their house. She should be allowed to do these things. No way should a parent be able to just throw in the towel on a whim and leave with the kids. If they want to leave without a judgement that the spouse their leaving is dangerous, an adulterer, or mental... then they should leave empty handed period.
8356	Parents should not be able to just throw in the towel on a whim and leave with the kids. If they want to leave without a judgement that the spouse their leaving is dangerous, an adulterer, or mental, then they should leave empty handed period.
8357	is wrong. It is simply false that a judge can “throw in the towel on a whim and leave with the kids”. If the couple is willing to do so, then that is their decision. Without going into specifics, think about kids who live with a drunken and abusive parent, but then become caregivers to the other parent who is not abusive and is often over-reliant upon the children, but has worked hard to come out of poverty. If those children were to leave the home to live with a rich, educated parent and then have their inheritance, those children would be hungry, because they now depend on the other parent for their life.
8358	While it may be costly for the parents in terms of driving lawsuits, changing family dynamics and divorce etc, the parents need not be left without legal rights. Also, family dynamics should be able to change according to the individual couple's choice while leaving the parent role to the child's parents, and avoiding single parent issues. It will also save the child from being exposed to the life style of their mom and will ensure the child's right to a home, education and family support.
8359	It's not that Mary had a job for nine months; it's that she just had a baby. Even more absurd is that since Kate and William are six months older than their baby cousin, this year, all they've done since the birth of their baby is cuddle and ride with William in the front of the limousine. Instead of what's been an idle 13 years of William off-popping girls on the grass while his royal wife slept during the first three years of their marriage while she "single-parented" William's kids, what's been going on has been nothing but glamor and popularity for William. It's about time to let the baby out the bottle!
8360	No, it is definitely not. There are several rules governing what you can and cannot do to the flag (assuming you are talking about the greatest and prettiest flag in the world – Old Glory). Check the site below to see them.  FYI – Bushy Bush desecrated an American flag by signing his name to it for a fan (I call fans of Bush “traitors”). He is thereby a traitor to this country, and should be tried and condemned as such. Just my thoughts on the subject. Can you tell I didn’t vote for him?
8361	Almost all prepositions have established meanings but specific English words carry the semantic weight of prepositions. In this way, The European Court’s interpretations of the law are actually verboten (verboten is prohibited).

8365	I'm curious about your personal situation. How long have you been together? What is his age? Does he have kids? Are his ex's parents in the picture? Are his ex's kids involved? How long ago did you meet his ex? How do you know him? How old was he before you met him? Why did you get involved? Did you break it off with him? Did the girl get involved? Can you name the ex of the ex? Is he in love with her? What does he say to the daughter? Is the daughter involved? How do the other two react when their boyfriend cheats on them? Do they get caught by the police, or do they just let their boyfriends do whatever they want with their girlfriends?
8366	This is not a difficult choice, knowing that he will be your friend, and keeping that child healthy and safe. However, I also think it would be nice to maintain a relationship with your family tree even if it is on a smaller scale, and he has many flaws. My personal preference is to not have anything to do with family, and I think he would be wise to that decision. I think you should put an end to the relationship but work toward a future of amicability with each person. If he also wins the lawsuit, you will at least know his intentions. If he insists on a relationship, then you should take your time and not be distracted by thinking about him. You can maybe try to look around for the children because I believe the lawsuit was for you. Therefore, you might get just what you deserve.  Good luck.
8367	Because only tv can bring you live news at books you cannot find, it's educational. Because only the people who understand and are willing to understand can love. Because there is a brief window in which you can apply the breaks, thinking of the people involved in this confusing web and the decisions you make and have to make will impact the people in those situations. What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet? His appearance is a reflection of his values. His thoughts, actions, and interactions will reflect his values. The person with the financial resources can afford to have someone who is young, beautiful, rich, and wealthy. They will be thinking how to make this relationship work and what this man has done to deserve the love of this woman. The average person may be wondering how this one man can give up his children for a love he hasn't shared. This average person can put his child in the orphanage for someone who loves him. The children can grow up and this family can end up together and probably end up living on welfare. Our society doesn't talk enough about this. If your boyfriend knows what he is doing, then he probably can handle giving up on the child. If he does know what he is doing, then maybe he loves the child enough to give it up. Now this depends on the woman and man they are with. So if you are confused and are not sure if you still love him, why not talk to him about this? Ask him if he will take the child if you give it to him. If they seem open to the idea, I would say no. Just thinking of people in this tangled web and how you decided will affect those people can make you confused and not sure of yourself. Is this going to end well or badly for the children?  Look out for yourself, think about what the outcome of this will be for the people
8368	I really feel for you. That's a tough situation. Are you sure that you are really in love with him? Be careful not to confuse other feelings for love. Did you know he was your uncle before you got involved? I know you fall in love with who you fall in love with but there is a brief window in which you can apply the breaks. What about the other woman he is with? Has he spoken to her yet? If I were you, I would try to steer clear and if he manages to end the relationship with the other lady and keep his relationship with the kids maybe you could think about him again. I don't know about the law and deformities. I would say no to both questions, but just think of the people involved in this tangled web and how your decisions will effect them. Its tough I know. Good luck.
8369	It is difficult to know if you are really in love with him. Be careful not to confuse other feelings for love and did you know he was your uncle before you got involved. It's tough, but if I were you, I would try to steer clear and if he manages to end the relationship with the other lady and keep his relationship with the kids, maybe you could think about him again. I know it is tough, but I would say no to both questions. The law and deformities are complex and its difficult to tell if a person is really good or bad based on outside factors only.
8370	Just like any other thing, there's a point of no return. When you catch up with the law, you can't let go of it no matter what.
8371	Well I think you know what it is and are probably trying to grow it from the way you are talking about. Marijuana seeds don't fly out of birds. Any dork knows what mj looks like just from the leaf, yeah you can get in trouble for cultivation, not that much if you only have one plant and claim you don't know what it is. They won't believe you anyway. You won't get caught, if the cops find out then your friends really aren't your friends.

8375	Use illegal drugs regardless of their condition or sex is criminal. However, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the birth if she is using illegal drugs....after that, she should go to prison. The problem is who is going to pay for that? That's right, the taxpayer. The taxpayer has to take responsibility for the stupid things people do. Accountability is the number one lacking quality amoung many Americans today. The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibilty, is enabling these morons to continue making poor desiciones, having children, doing drugs...etc. Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Good luck and take care.
8376	You shouldn't use illegal drugs regardless of your condition or sex. However, a more severe punishment should be imposed on a woman who would subject her baby to illegal drugs or alcohol. There is certainly the theory that a person who abuses alcohol or drugs could under heavy substance abuse circumstances be dangerous to herself, her children and others.  There has to be a way to prosecute the drug user after her child was born.  I would establish a child custody issue so the new parents don't have the liability for what the mother has done. This is the worst thing for a family to have to deal with.  I'm not saying that the mothre should be arrested, but after her infant came into the world...she is guilty of neglecting the baby.  Accountability is the number one lacking quality amoung many Americans today. The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibility, is enabling these morons to continue making poor desisions, having children, doing drugs etc.  Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution. Until we answer the question why do people do what they do? By our actions, we are causing the world to change.

8380	To me, it is sadly not likely that the court will change its precident so quickly and drastically. Hopefully, though, the court will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term abortions, will require parental notification for teenagers, and will require these "doctors" to become required reporters of abuse.
8381	Even if the Chief Justice and the Associate Justice are reinstated, it is unlikely that the court would mess with the precedents and the judges might give a little leeway.  Hopefully, though, the court will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term, require parental notification for teenagers, and require these doctors to become reporters of abuse like other medical professionals.

8383	The chief justice and associate justice are made up of the most conservative judges on the court, so it's not likely that any major changes will be made in the existing precedent. Hopefully, though, they will see fit to uphold such things as bans on late-term abortions, require parental notification for teenagers, and require doctors to become reporters of abuse like all other medical professionals.

8385	Why should all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone?  After all isn't it their God's job to judge them?  And to "punish". They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?
8386	Why not? People complain it's against God. Those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. Man makes these rules and uses God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives. Do you hear anyone complaining? Marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain. Atheists get married. What's the big deal? So all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone, after all isn't it their God's job to judge them? And to "punish". They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?
8387	Because someone else is going to make that decision.
8388	Is it against God's will? The hypocrites who criticize God are probably discriminating against gay people. Their religion forbids such acts, which are in contravention of human rights. God is just. He would certainly be disappointed in them. Don't worry about the people who don't follow the rules.  They are sure to find ways to break them. If someone isn't happy with the society where he is living, then he is free to choose a different one. You could end up like me, living in an apartment full of hippy rads. You could have found a great neighborhood with a great community.
8389	Why not? People complain that it's against God. So those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. Man makes these rules and uses God as an excuse.

8390	There are a variety of reasons for why children with autism might be able to be servants or highly proficient in math and science or music and generally do so well in those fields. I don't think you should label children as perverts or gay before their time. It's child sexual abuse.
8391	ADHD may make you harder to focus, but if you do focus, you are more motivated to grasp things. I have friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do well, get the highest grades, and retain knowledge more. And some people with autism can be servants, meaning they are highly skilled in something, generally math, science, or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let these kids blossom and be there own unique people, advancing human to the next step in our history. Please cmv!
8392	ASD is not a problem in itself, but it can cause problems. A lot of really smart and gifted people have it. Some examples of people with autism are Einstein, Picasso, Beethoven, Isaac Newton, and lots more. Because of this, if I hear the word autism I dont try to put one out of their mind. Furthermore, autism does not mean one person thinks like one person, it means they have different thinking styles and capabilities. So, to put autism out of my mind or make that person look like an idiot or never listen to them again because they have autism, that is a problem.
8393	An autistic person can be a good servant but an autistic person is not a genius. Also, you shouldn't use genetic science or other scientific means to make a mutant. You should just call it sick or try whatever works and is humane.
8394	Adhd and some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution, it makes you not focus easily, but when you focus, you really grasp and impressively do great things and get the highest grades. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. Some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math or science, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history. Please cmv!
8395	Political ideologies can be secular religions, they can't be. A political ideology is a set of views that are held. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology.
8396	Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self described liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to improve society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as the holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a Utopia. These differences in dogma often resorts to divisive politics. How is that any different to religious differences?
8397	Personal attitudes, politics, and family leave many schools unrecognizable as anything but conflict zones. Conflict comes to schools when their ideals clash with the rules of the school system. No one is at fault in these school battles unless their personal ideologies directly impact a students academic success.
8398	People often go on in dogmatic remarks by stating that they think only a certain political ideology is the right way. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions, where beliefs do not have to be necessarily practiced in life to call it true. Many self described liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to better society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as their holy code. These differences in religious dogma often resorts to divisive politics. How is that any different to political ideologies?
8399	In point of view, political ideology does not make you dogmatic. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology.

8400	I'm in my 20's, healthy, and I get mail all the time telling me I should donate bone marrow (which costs between a third of a million dollars to $800,000 just to transplant my marrow that I'm giving away for free) and, while I'm on the list, I'd jump at the chance to sell it. I am positive I could sell my liver for at least 100k to a rich alcoholic who couldn't get on the transplant list and if I'm not allowed to, it shouldn't be allowed to use that as a defense of abortion. The medical industry is making money hand over fist and I want a piece of it. If women have the right to abortion because of their right to bodily autonomy, I should have the right to sell my marrow and organs because of my right to bodily autonomy.
8401	I'm 20 years old and healthy, and I get letters all the time, telling me I should donate bone marrow and I would jump at the chance to sell it, while I'm on the list. In other words, the medical industry is making money hand over fist and I want a piece of it.  If women have the "right" to abort because of their bodily autonomy, then I should have the "right" to sell my marrow, my organs, my sperm, and then the list can go on and on. Also, the medical industry is taking money away from the health care system so I want my dollars to go to the neediest, not take it from my family's health care to make the medical industry more profitable. For all those people out there that have opted into a universal health care system, I support it, but not only that, but I also want a piece of the pie.

8405	To prove something, a standard argument must begin with a simple premise.
8406	Take something you consider yourself truly knowledgable about and look at the news coverage. You'll find it partial at best.  You'll encounter people who "read an article" related your field and understand how naive they sound.  Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give a layman a foothold in the subject matter.  This is not to say that news isn't valuable.  But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject.  In fact it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.
8407	The proof is in the pudding: Take something that you consider yourself truly knowledgeable about and look at the news coverage. You'll find it partial at best.

8408	You are right, evidence is with in the pudding.  Take something you think you truly know, look at the news coverage.  You'll find a lot of people making up stories to fit this or that group.  Journalists can only provide so much context and it's usually never enough to give you a foot hold on the subject matter. This is not to say that news isn't valuable.  But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine, Russia or ever done any research or met people from either culture, you should speak, think and feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject. In fact it would be more wise to ask questions then to pretend I have an opinion.  
8409	There is evidence that many families do support gay marriage.  However, after the passage of the marriage amendment, it is bound to happen at the local level more than at the national level in part because of the fact that people are not confident in the official system and will try to have their say openly.  Overall, the United States still keeps to a conservative position that supports heterosexual relationships and family.
8410	If you see a train coming across the tracks, don't stop. You might start to feel the urge to stop, but it's best to cross the tracks in a controlled and steady manner so you don't stop suddenly and injure yourself or harm someone else.
8411	CMV: There are several reasons why stopping a car and waiting for a crossing could increase the risk of an accident. First, since the car is stopped, it loses momentum and its overarching weight is momentarily eliminated, resulting in the car slowing down to the point where it is most likely to crash into something. Second, cars stop at railroad crossings all the time to let people onboard the next car in a train. These cars don't know about your stop, and that could result in them expecting the last car to actually stop when in fact it is only stationary. Finally, the nonstoping car could enter the next train to the point where it may collide with another car or as well as other vehicles, which leads me to option number 3. I think it is safer to approach railroad crossings like any other vehicle, but if you have other vehicles behind you, it may make sense to give yourself a little extra time to reduce your risk of an accident and could even make sense to stop and wait until you see other traffic.
8412	Regarding the subjects raised by Canard, I strongly disagree. I live in the Northeast and experience very little train activity except maybe brief, rare yard siding stops. The trains in our area are well maintained and are generally kept out of the local area. I have, on several occasions, had to approach a level crossing. I have performed this maneuver as if it were a simple intersection. If your going to approach a level crossing, you are expecting there to be traffic. Sometimes you have to wade through heavy vegetation, but you are usually amazed at what you see crossing the tracks. I rarely see cars in our community go over the crossing.  Also, this is what has been given. What we can do is debate and fight for change. I’m not entirely a fan of the idea that government mandates behavior, but that’s what we have got. What we can’t do is pretend that the law does not apply to us when it actually does. That just gives the impression of lazy thinking.  If you want I can search for other examples, but there’s nothing particularly new about the arguments Canard raises.  A:  But the issue really is about the politics of race and about how the pandemic will be used to push racial change as part of a long term trend toward authoritarianism. The unionization of restaurant workers and others in the food industry has historically been rife with race and gender issues.  It's quite possible that the demographics of the industry could shift in 2021 (and it seems that such has happened in other industries).  But that would be part of a social agenda that worked long before the pandemic was announced.  We don't know yet whether a shift to nationalized at-home service would even be possible. As for the pandemic itself, authoritarian states have already enforced mandatory wearing of masks and other restrictions.  Those are designed to increase voter suppression by keeping local public officials and the general public from protesting the decisions being made.  The pandemic has been a catalyst for
8413	Of course, stop at railroad crossings. I think of this every time I see a truck/bus with "This vehicle stops at all railroad crossings" written across the back. I feel that stopping, listening for a train, and going again is much riskier than not stopping at train crossings. I feel this way for 3 reasons:  1. If your engine stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety.  2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it.  3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk.  I think that the safest option just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road.
8414	Absolutely stop, listen to the audible sounds of the train, and then go again.

8415	- Lobbying is prohibited.  No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine.  - Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means.  The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.  This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate.  I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only 5 minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also not American, so I do not fully understand how your political system works. I hope this doesn't sound too stupid.
8416	It sounds too stupid to be legal. The only way someone can influence someone to vote for a presidential candidate is by spending money to publicize the candidate. Outsiders can't influence who gets voted. I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, but it seems really stupid to have just one candidate receiving publicity. Therefore, I think the system has flaws.

8420	So, little about me is I'm currently a 19 year old male enrolled in college. I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. In terms of intimate relationships, they are non-existent. I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I'm not an attractive person by any means, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even, if by some miracle they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies/TV. I feel that a person like me isn’t really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.
8421	Though I am an attention seeking person I have never told her that I wanted her to give me a bj, I never felt like it would be the right thing to do in that situation. I suppose I could give her one, but I would be a creep. Also, I'm not sure if I'd enjoy having her perform it on me? Perhaps we could find a place where we both could have privacy?
8422	In terms of intimate relationships, I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. I find relationships are a waste of time, except romantic relationships. My idea of a healthy sexual relationship is a onesie and some bouncy boobs.
8423	Most young men feel awkward, shy, or like they are too old for dating women, so they stay single or they fuck a bunch of them.
8424	One of my roommates here is taking a year off school to travel around the world... Anywho, I used to go out with this girl who moved out and parted ways with me because I used to bring her drinks home.    I'm a daytripper. I would rather go sightseeing and such than stay at my hotel. That being said, I wouldn't mind staying home anyways because the issue is the work life and it's tough to find a decent job in Texas. 
8425	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was a total rewrite where Disney threw out the old faithful and just turned an ordinary story into a spectacular and extraordinary experience. Even if you hadn't seen or heard of Kimba the White Lion, the Lion King was so predictable as to be cliche. The characters and songs weren't anything more special than any other Disney movie either. Even the author of this article surely knew this since the lion king who wrote this article first finished it wasn't young, he was an old man. Perhaps this person was so sentimental that the first time they saw a black pride of lions he became aware that his king was gone.

I believe that the people who prosthelytize about the movie are mostly the ones who watched in as kids or young adults looking through nostalgia colored glasses. People who's first exposure to a real and dramatic story was Le Roi Lion so they came to believe that Le Roi Lion did something unique or special (when it really, really didn't).

8428	There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past. Movies like Snow White, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast went on to become classics, but there was a time before all those that were too exciting to watch for kids (especially kids older than Disney movies are meant for).  Lion King was one of Disney movies that were kind of a miss for me and that is the original reason I still don't feel much of a connection with it. And I still don't feel it does something special or unique compared to all the rest.
8429	The movie was pretty silly when it was first released, but it does have a pretty great story line and wasn't as bad as the critics said it was to be.
8430	Google searches will result in many horror stories regarding lottery winners. Many are forced to move from their home towns, face lawsuits from people looking for a quick buck from a deep pocket, and even have a much higher chance of being murdered. I feel it should be a person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings. I understand that the main dissenting opinion is the idea that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a long time people have been buying scratch off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
8431	It makes no sense for people to buy lottery tickets if they are guaranteed to win so why would anyone want to? It must be possible to cheat. The main dissenting opinion is the fact that the lottery employees are really good at not committing fraud. However, these employees have years of experience cheering people up after losing too many times. It's not a huge deal for people to collect their money and then forget about it. Nobody says there is an income tax in lottery winners either. We all know there are problems with the original lottery but many of the problems will go away for the rest of us.

8433	There are several ways that these people can get rich from their lottery winnings. Some of them want to move their way of living into something more exciting. However, it is not fun for us in our town or state to see how many people left. It would be nice to be able to share the money with our local community. We should consider moving to an area that can offer us a better life.
8434	As a lottery winner should have a right to privacy and not be a target of hate. Also, there is no reason to believe that a government operation is rigged with millions of money being won at the same time. I'm against exposing people to other large jackpot events. It's just ridiculous because it doesn't prove that it is actually rigged.
8435	Officer said they would take him to his police station to handle it there but some of the other cops stopped by and the 'policeman' felt insecure about them making it personal so he fled.
8436	Homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
8437	High Downtown Los Angeles is home to the homeless homeless there... homeless are sometimes assigned to flats outside this area but more and more homeless are being forced back into the downtown area this has grown a lot faster than any urban planning could handle
8438	There is not a whole lot of homeless in downtown LA because downtown LA houses lots of businesses, so the homeless can find food and other necessities there. So, in order to help downtown LA develop faster, it needs to get rid of homeless. I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
8439	More people should work in downtown LA instead of working in the fields. The homeless problem is not so much a problem there because those homeless can live with their families and are not as much of a nuisance as they are in other parts of the country. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness.   It is a bad policy to ignore the homeless problem because it hurts the local economy.

8440	An airline that accidentally crashed the Malaysia Airlines Flight 752 is asking its customers to change their flight to a later time that is more convenient for them, or offer to get them a full refund. The airline's actions make me seriously think twice about their safety record, and suggest that declining consumer confidence in the airline has begun to spread to the stock market. In light of this, I'm seriously considering accepting their offer of a refund.
8441	Last year I received an email from Malaysia Airlines offering me a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change my booking. I now doubt the safety record of this airline. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund.
8442	Looking at the airline's offer you say "you are on board the plane that's crashed". Could you please suggest a new rephrasing that makes it sound less alarmistic for the reader?
8443	In point of view, while flights are full, partly because of a crisis in the Boeing company, it should be better for passengers not to wait 2 or 3 hours in airports and to cancel or change their travel bookings to a later date.

8445	FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary?     I mean the setting looks good, and I like the idea of an epic quest across the solar system in my trusty spaceship, but the revelation of the ships not being flyable and there being no space combat -they're just cut scene machines- was a big disappointment for me.     Please, I want to be more excited for this game than I am. But it's being hailed as the next big new thing in gaming and I just don't see it.
8446	Because you're expecting the next big new thing in gaming and what you get is a solid looking FPS that focused on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas. How is this so revolutionary?     TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. 
8447	Boundarylands looks like a solid shooter with a nice setting, but I don't see how it is going to be such a revolutionary game. Really, it looks like Borderlands with a different setting and tone. But otherwise it is a solid looking FPS that focuses on classes, co-op, and loot across a variety of small open world areas.

8448	If you read the first paragraph again you'll see that BUNGIE fans are pretty vocal. I won't read through every single bad article because it's all just opinions.
8449	Game developers are constantly coming up with new ideas and concepts that open the door for new games and technological advancements. But for Bungie, another FPS, that came out just recently, it sounds like they had a clear mission, and I mean this was a sandbox, where players could craft weapons and armor, but now they are limited to weapons and gear you have in your inventory, although they will be created in spawn zones.
8450	I am Canadian by birth, but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I find everyone in Canada tries to hold onto their culture and wave a flag signifying their bloodline and heritage. I thought this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a time but discovered I don't need to define myself by a single nationality/nationalities. I think this is a good thing because we all are different. Why can’t we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity?
8451	To be Canadian or Indian or Middle-Eastern or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. The fear of losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted.
8452	Accepting and embracing our differences is essential to growth of our culture. The fear of losing our identity tends to lead to bigotry and ignorance.
8453	It is common to be Canadian and have Canadian parents but not to be Canadian in nationality. It is unusual for someone to be Serbian or Croatian and have parents from Serbia or Croatia.
8454	Canada is home to numerous and varied ethnic groups. We can have a Canadian identity without identifying with a single nationality.
8455	To my mind kids owe their parents everything because the parents brought them into this world and gave them life and kept them fed and sheltered and relatively healthy during their childhood. Kids should stay at home (or as close to home as possible) for their entire lives, so that in case a parent has any need at all, the kids can drop what they're doing and help the parents, because they owe them their lives. I believe that kids don't know what they're doing, ever, and that parents always know better than their kids.

8460	Men such as I, don't have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of "oppression" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued.

8462	This is a simple example. Women do not think that men are equal to them as far as men with respect to worthiness to be pursued. Many men do not accept the standards imposed on them by the stereotype of femininity. Such norms impact men and women equally, because they share the same concept of femininity.

8465	They would need to protect themselves a lot better against China. The Chinese are becoming stronger both in their economy and military and i'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II. The Japanese won't even acknowledge the genocide in the same way Germans did with the Holocaust, that's just rubbing salt in the wound. On the other side I know Japan is being protected by American forces but how much can they trust the US? Would the US go to war with China over Japan? I think it won't happen and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
8466	In point of view, when Japan becomes stronger both in their economy and military, and i'm sure they have plenty of generals just aching for payback from all the atrocities committed by the Japanese in World War II.

8467	China and Japan are having serious issues now, especially regarding Japan. The Chinese have become stronger both in their economy and their military and they're just waiting for a way to attack Japan and get the long sought after revenge they just can't seem to get. Japan won't even acknowledge genocide the way Germany does with the Holocaust, that's just going to add even more to the pain for them. On the other hand, I know they're being protected by American forces, but how much can they trust the US? What if the US goes to war with China over Japan? I think it wouldn't happen, but they could be faced in a tight spot, and they would just decide to abandon those allies.

(Or South Korea for that matter) I think it won't happen, and in a tight spot, they would just choose to abandon those allies.
8469	Japan is becoming more and more powerful with both military and economy. I hope it will never attack China and hopefully China will never attack Japan. America will also continue to defend Japan in order to protect itself, but I think that trust in the US will be hard to build up.
8470	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background. Because skin color is a gift that is given to a person at birth by their parents, why should it be used to signal their ability to get a college scholarship?
8471	Colors shouldn't be used as factors in scholastic merit, the intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning. However, blanket use of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
8472	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. The intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning, aimed at helping needy students. However, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
8473	It's of no use to have affirmative action laws if they are not properly enforced. First of all, affirmative action laws tend not to be respected and are sometimes broken, the counterargument being that the purpose of the law is to give priority to qualified minorities. There is no evidence that affirmative action in colleges actually helps black and Hispanic students.  The point here is that although colored students may need the aid, they are still the same students and should be treated the same as everyone else. The purpose is to ensure equal treatment regardless of race and that the students are chosen as they should be.
8474	Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter their background. A spectrum of college scholarship options should be available, not a "blanket" like black and white. Student colors aren't geared toward parental socioeconomic status. They are known to have merit, some their background will prove this, many times students have this color and don't attend the same college.   I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill "race quotas" to "diversify the campus" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.   The intent behind the Affirmative Action is certainly well-meaning, aimed at helping needy students. However, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
8475	The democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that as a union guy, our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
8476	I understand that democracy is the best form of government but it needs to be backed by economic democracy that equalizes the struggle of citizens to have a voice. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my rights it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
8477	PAXIL is a very effective drug for post-coital bleeding... it reduces the period drastically... and can even help keep to the original fecundity due to women's emotions like (crying, anger, not a minimum day of post coital bleeding in the end)..why arent we using this before putting a woman to bed who has won more than enough money to fill hospitals and donate blood to the poor for the benefit of other women who arent into it.

8480	I'm not sure what the popular view on reddit is, but in the real world, I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought.  I don't really think it matters, because the founding fathers were not gods who can solve any problem or know everything.  We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like the founding fathers were infallible.  I'm not saying the founding fathers were always wrong, but I don't think a view deserves any more merit just for being the view of one of the founding fathers.  I think political scientists should focus on what would be the best solution to an issue instead of interpreting what the founding fathers would have done.
8481	This is my opinion regarding why the founding fathers would have left slavery in the New World, but what would they have done in the 1800s, 2000s, or even 2010s.  It matters so little that it shouldn't even matter.

8483	When it comes to interpreting what the founding fathers would have thought, I do not believe the opinions of the founding fathers will have the same weight as research that is carried out by political scientists.  I do not think that someone who is a political scientist should give their opinion as much weight as the opinion of one of the founding fathers, because political scientists should be focusing on how they would think the people who signed the Constitution would have handled a certain problem, instead of focusing on a view that was said by one of the founding fathers."
8484	I'm not sure what the popular view of reddit is about this, but in the real world I hear arguments from both sides of the political spectrum regarding what the founding fathers would have thought.  I don't really think it matters because the founding fathers were not gods who could prepare for any problem or know everything, they were just people.  We live in a different time than the founding fathers, and even if we didn't, it isn't like the founding fathers were infallible.  I'm not saying the founding fathers were always right, but I don't think a view deserves any more merit just for being the view of one of the founding fathers.  I believe political scientists should focus on what would be the best solution to an issue instead of interpreting what the founding fathers would have done.
8485	There are some fetuses that are created to die and some that are not, it doesn't matter. Just because some people can't survive on their own, it doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. From my point of view the net gain would be negative and would open Pandora's box, thus I disagree. We have an obligation to protect the fetus if the need for protection can be clearly proven. It seems to me that since the mother can not make the informed decision as to what the consequences are, we have an obligation to protect the child. Also, I wouldn't want abortion to be made illegal on religious grounds, for that too would be an open Pandora's box. I simply do not believe in the sanctity of life, suicide is perfectly fine, so this shouldn't be a concern. To protect a person from societal pressure when making an informed decision, we should protect it in this case. I don't like abortion, but this is an unfair fear based social engineering against the poor who can not come to a decision. I just don't see how it is morally right that you aren't allowed to change your mind, it comes down to "moral paralysis". For me, this is cause for the gross inequity of giving the poor an unfair advantage over the rich. In the end, I don't believe a tragedy would be avoided, but due to the negative aftermath to society, this wouldn't be the tragedy that everyone would want. So I would replace the words "giving the child up for adoption in such cases" with "the world has caused uproar and rose up against
8486	For me, just because a human cannot survive on its own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it.
8487	There's many benefits to abortions that I can't justify. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious issue. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it. How do you define informed decision? It's not the last stage of life, so it doesn't have an informed choice. It's no one is judging what it will do, either, so I also can't justify it that the person making that decision has the right to do so. I believe that life is something that everyone is responsible to protect and value for its own sake.
8488	Abortion is positive because it free the unborn from suffering and pain. It allows mothers to control their own bodies. There are plenty of ways that it can be used to defend democracy and rights.
8489	I've long struggled with this and I'd like to read some strong arguments from the other side. I know the benefits of abortion to society, but I can't justify them simply because the net gain is positive - that's opening Pandora's box to me. For me, just because a human cannot survive on it's own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious "sanctity of life" issue. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it. It is an odd issue for me, I want to make abortion legal and easily accessible from a society standpoint, but I can't reach that position due to moral complications. So change my view.
8490	In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat because fat and curvy aren't the same thing. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said I have nothing against someone for being overweight.

It was like three hours later, and Alan was still standing next to the window. An elderly lady over 75 years old crossed the road from the corner of the street where Alan was standing and headed for the sidewalk. As she walked, she was focusing on her feet. She did not realize that Alan stood there until she got close enough and looked around to the left corner. Alan did not see the lady until she turned toward the man. She walked up the sidewalk and reached out to take something from the man. He turned around, pulled the lady up on her hands and feet and pushed her down the sidewalk. Alan stopped and watched the man move. It seemed to take him no time to leave and he did not seem to say anything to his driver. The driver did not even turn on the car’s parking lights. As Alan stood there staring at the man, he pulled his black bag out of his pocket and took the license plate from it. Then he held out his hand to Alan. The younger man looked at the old lady. “I wouldn’t want that lady,” he said to the driver. “
8492	As a person who is not fat and considered curvy (as a skinny type), I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy because it causes the misconception that curvy women need to be thin in order for them to be considered curvy. As a fat woman I don't care about the things that people say about me so I don't care what others think about curvy women. However, someone who is curvy and thin is healthy because they don't have extra fat to be super skinny which would actually be healthier. Also, there are curvy people who are not happy with being called curvy but they are happy with them self's because they are really beautiful rather than being said to be "a fat curvy woman" which would be something that they don't actually want. In fact it isn't the same thing because fat people can get the same be flattered of being called curvy even though they may not really like that but flattered they are. That being said I think everyone should have equal right to choose their body type or be called whatever you want without feeling the need to say something hurtful towards another person's body type.  A:  A's verse  You will still see this world, I'll still see this world, and I'll still paint this world.  I should rewrite to "But I will still see this world through my eyes, but my world will have changed." I don't care for it as I would like to see A discuss more options and priorities; rather he seems to be building his own world where he can paint, and perhaps draw.  A:  In my experience, non-native English speakers often leave their impression of English syntax in their sentences. The change you propose here is too drastic. For one, what you propose would
8493	When I read the word fat I think of hated vegetables, butts, lazy guy, pizza, wiggly dads, lazy fat kids. Although a slim woman can make overweight people look good. Fat people can work out and eat healthily. A curvy woman has beauty. A slim woman has no.
8494	To me, curvy is like the girls in &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. It denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is healthy body type that people have naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the &quot;skinny&quot; category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight.

8495	All the fossil records tell us that all the other organisms lived at the same time, so clearly they would have lived together before the flood. It would take a lot of extra work to reconcile the fossil record and evolutionary theory.
8496	So creationists like to argue that evolution is wrong. Yet the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth which moves at 1 mph or less manage to outright and outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? How can all that be? The science just doesn't work this way. If all living organisms were created on earth at the same time, how can a giant land sloth which moves at a rate that varies widely from 0.1 mph to 1 mph manage to outlive a clams which lived 5 billion years ago? How can all that be? The science just doesn't work this way.

If all organisms lived at the same time, how did a giant land sloth, which moves at 1 mph or less, manage to outlive an organism that thrives in water during a global water flood? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous and that the flood never occurred. The fossil record is correct.

8499	So creationists argue that evolution is wrong but their claim is disproved by the fossil record. In fact the fossil record shows that ancient clams are in layers below giant land sloths. So, if all organisms lived at the same time how did giant land sloth which moves at 1 mph or less manage to outlast the clams? It seems to me that such a question is preposterous, and the flood never occurred. That evolution's time line is correct.

8510	My family has been in the same house for nearly my entire life. They are the most constant presence in my entire life. More than that we all share the same blood.

8520	Before, I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be common law. As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment. It seems when your new all your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new/ different. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside. It seems after a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation same positions, same girl, same everything....I find the excitement of having sex with someone much better, constantly being turned on not being able to keep your hands off eachother.
8521	Before I was married but I was commonlaw, therefore I will consider it the same thing. As far as sex comes is better when you get with someone new. It feels different, the hormones are racing. After some time the relationship seems like a routine, the quantity and quality decrease. I find the excitement is better with someone new because you never know what will happen next.
8522	Before being with someone long enough to be common law, I would like to assume there was no prenup, or commitment involved, so you wouldn't get a good explanation. As far as sex came, it was much better in the early relationships, before marriage or long term commitment. The excitement of being with someone new, or different. After a long time, having sex with the same person, seemed like it lost its bright shiny side. However, after a long time, things start to feel like a routine with less passion and excitement and experimentation. New positions, new women, new everything. I find the excitement of having sex with someone much more enjoyable, being constantly turned on, not being able to keep your hands off each other.

8525	Known for holding extremist Islamic views? Check. Shouted Allahu Akbar during his attack? Check. Ties to extreme Islamic terrorist? Check. Expressed hatred of infidels? Check. Frequently went to Jihadi web sites? Check. The man was clearly an Islamic Extremist and this was clearly a terrorist attack. The better question would be: Why can't we admit it?
8526	Extremist Islamic views and the media will be able to distort the truth by showing outliers like this as wrong views and their horrific and dangerous terrorist behavior as a state of right thinking.
8527	The facts are: Salman Abedi, the man who attacked at Manchester's Ariana Grande concert, was an extremely radical Muslim. He was known for extremist views, expressing hatred toward non-Muslims, and training for violence. He was both a terror recruit and a perpetrator of terrorist acts and organized suicide attacks. See the list of reasons in the first paragraph.

8533	Death should be celebrated because the life of the deceased is documented through their memories.

Funerals are a reminder to the living of the way of life that the dead person was alive, that person can still be remembered. Mourning over the loss of the living, not the dead itself, promotes suicide. Celebrating their life in the spirit is important. Dont mourn over their loss. Celebrate their life, everything about them, remember and be happy. Never really comprehend this till you lose someone close that you love.

They should not use animal testing for products such as make-up or perfume, but if they are testing a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal testing is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.
8560	Absolutely not. Every one's sense of morality is different. Thus if a prochoice person were engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-life person could call them moraless all they want but they still cannot change the fact that the prochoice person has valid points. In fact, in many cases, morality is extremely subjective and thus saying that someone "lacks morality" is a very valid argument.
8561	Absolutely not, because everyone's sense of morality is different. Thus, for example, if a pro-lifer was engaged in an abortion debate, the pro-lifer could call them moraless all they want but still not change the fact that the pro-lifer has valid points. I see the issue that it's not a good argument to use morality to solve any of the world's problems such as abortion but use factual arguments that can be mathematically proven.
8562	It is quite possible for someone that hates abortion to be against abortion but they could not fully support it. Besides, morality is extremely subjective and saying someone "lacks morality" is a valid argument like saying someone "lacks a penis." True there are some abortions that are unjustified but there are also some pregnant women that are more dangerous then abortions.
8563	Yes it is, if all the pro-lifers marched on a pro-choicer home and threw fertilizer all over the place.
8564	The argument that LOUISVILLE LADY DRIVER's point of view is somewhat limited because some people might view abortion as morally acceptable since it is seen as a way to end a growing, yet still alive fetus. However, this law does apply to everyone and might not be seen the same by different people. This law will encourage the government to catch up to the sudden "progress" that America has had in recent years and how abortion has gotten more and more common with modern time.
8565	Isn't donating a tiny fraction of your earnings much better than not donating at all? And if I am going to buy an iPod or Google Goggles, isn’t it better to buy a red one that sends even a little percent of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn’t raise money for anyone but Apple? It’s good that your handbag doesn’t belong to Apple, but it would be better if it didn’t give anything back to anyone at all, right?
8566	If it's not worse and it's not the same, chances are it's, well, a little better.
8567	If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's a little better than nothing.
8568	Being slight more terrifying than terrible it is better to work hard and help because I know if I don't the world can be terrible and the good times wouldn't be no help to me.
8569	Isn’t buying an iPod even if it’s a rubber one a little better? Although I cannot determine whether buying an iPod or something else is better; your choice depends on the situation. The one thing I do know is that buying the black one that will have at least raised a few more dollars will be better than buying the band ring that will only have gone to the cause that designed it. Yeah, black puts more money in the hands of women who want it--at least in the hands of the cause for which it’s being designed. I don’t have a problem with it from my own perspective. I do, however, think it’s a little irresponsible from the perspective of advancing the #LIVESTRONG campaign.
8570	On Battlefield 2 you might want to take another game and learn how to have fun and not get killed. You really need some education on how to kill and when to use your weapons. On Call of Duty 4 it's boring because the missions are similar and really repetitive. The controls are weird, because in some missions you have to drive a tank, in others you have to shoot a sniper, in others you have to go scrounge around the map and looking for body parts to collect, in others you have to go to that huge map and kill everyone. On Call of Duty 3, the controls are actually OK, but this game is so big that it takes 10 or more minutes to get through one game, and this time has been wasted because there's no purpose of it. The controls are bad because it's easy to get shot down by suicide bombers in the middle of the city! There's no point of reloading a gun, because the place where your sitting in that vehicle is loaded with tanks! The maps on this game are just too big. On Medal of Honor: Warfighter 2, the maps are also big, but the controls are better than on Call of Duty 4. There are few missions, but if you are a veteran, you will know how to manage these. We find that Battlefield 3 has the best controls. The maps are smaller, but this helps to stay in the game for a longer time, and if you're smart, you will not kill anyone or get killed. The maps are big enough so that there is no point to go killing all the people, because nobody will pay attention to you, because you will be in the middle of nowhere. There are different types of weapons with different skills to develop. The maps are similar to real wars, and this makes these games more realistic.
8571	The worst bug is when one tries to break out of a prison by getting a rat to place a magnet under the phone or inside a hole, and thus, according to the Army's law, breaks out, and the entire penal colony starts going insane. This bug is why the whole world hates MW2. The whatnot bug, its very rare, but still exists. Its when on day 1 of war, while you are flying the chick of a humvee, all of a sudden, your chick falls out and goes OoooooooooooOOo!
8572	At first, the microcontrollers are used to control lighting and other low-level electronics. However, they cannot be replaced with tiny batteries, so they are also used for more energy-intensive applications. Today, they are everywhere in our lives, from electronic mice and remote controls to personal computers, security systems and traffic lights.
8573	In MW2, you get shot from behind, get hit by a grenade thrown right at you or get thrown in the meat grinder of survival with only three magazines of ammo and skills that take time to developed. Plus weapons on MW2 are realistic, except for the AT4, which is not a guided munition.
8574	The problem with books is that they are boring and you have to go to the library or buy them yourself, whereas the game is a more fun way to read about the battle. Also, shooting a machine gun is more fun than shooting a gun that only shoots once.
8575	 School uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I do not believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
8576	Some school uniforms do remove the individuality that makes us all different and some are just used as part of the administration of the school to get money from the government. I think some school uniforms are just another way for the government to get money.
8577	Uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
8578	According to my point of view, uniforms take away the individuality that makes us all different. Yes, some people get into fights because of what they are wearing, but that's just us high schoolers. If we were all to wear uniforms, we would not notice who's who, and we would still get made fun of. I believe that school uniforms are just another way for the government to get your money.
8579	There is no question that uniforms take away your individuality and it hinders you from blindingly defeating your peers. When you are in uniform you can't tell who's what. But that doesn't mean that it is right. It isn't. Students should be free to wear whatever they want, regardless of whether other people think you are being funny or if the uniform appears to be a less-than-effortless example of the movie girl's pajamas.
8580	$16 for the first 2 hours is outrageous, its more like a $50 fee. Those are MANDALAY BANKS!!! They see you walk in that place and they just want to take it all from you. Also, I went to the Venetian and their valet was no charge as well. There is no reason for the MGM Resorts to take something away from you if you have to pay. Their programs are much more expensive than the mandalay bay.  I suppose this kind of thing is going to get taken into account more now because of the EDC letter but when I spoke to the front desk they could not tell me why valet was charged and how much they charge. No one can answer their own question.  I saw earlier today they have posted $60 long term parking at the Mandalay bay. Get your car into that parking lot and we'll take out $60 for you. What the fuck. You see, they only care about that guy in the white car. This is pretty nasty stuff.  They said I got screwed for $60 so I waited 4 hours to get out. This is a tough place for white guys because they make it very tough for non-whites.  So basically people are screwed because of greed
8581	For Mandalay Bay, expect they'll try to rip off you too. They'll charge you more for parking and for having to get the car out of the garage and put it right back in the park. Then they'll ask for $10-15 to get you out. The hotels in general are done the same way. Disgusting how they rip off tourists. I'd recommend not parking anywhere.
8582	To everyone that calls valet parking at the Mandalay Bay free and airport valet fees, my word on it this is just a scam to save a bunch of money. The Venetian doesn't charge you for valet. It's the MGM Corporation in general that does this. All of their hotels rip off customers.
8583	Parking at the mall at the most it costs about $5-$8, not $16 for 2 hours. If they are charging 16 for 2 hours they do not have to charge as much as $50 to $100 per night for valet.
8584	This is an entirely different issue. If you are ever in the LA area, make sure you park in the shopping center mall area. The Venetian does not charge for valet parking but the MGM resorts do. The great thing about shopping centers is you get free valet parking.
8585	It was just OK for me, at best. The menu is large but it comes across as very chain restaurant like. My friend had a burger and fries and I had a chicken sandwich with avocado and sweet potato fries. You get a salad first, I had Caesar and my friend had garden. The caesar salad was the highlight of my meal! It was fresh and crisp and nicely garlicy. My friend seemed to like the garden salad, ok but it looked pretty basic to me - mostly lettuce. My friend enjoyed his burger and I have to say it did look like a good burger. My sandwich came out cold, which is not a good start to a toasted sandwich. It might have been pretty good if it were hot, although it still would have been a little bland. The sweet potato fries were good, but that's not something you can't get at most pubs. It's true - the portion sizes are huge. But I do not make my meal decisions based solely on caloric intake.
8586	It's true that with the portion sizes, it would be better to have more food, however, it's also true that you should not be making your meal decision based solely on caloric intake.  High calorie foods taste better, but if we pay attention to diet, even that isn't the main motivation for eating.
8587	It was just okay for me, but not the best food. The menu is large, but it comes across as very chain-restaurant-like.

8590	Last second find... Not what you expected to hear in a great way! Who knew? Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime. Cheers

Close to the action and not far from the resort area. I'll definately be stopping in again soon. Thanks for sharing that one friend. Cheers to ya friend
8595	Down South Blvd. South is a really cool little place called Vietnam Grille. It is a crowded little clean restaurant. Yesterday in Charlotte it was windy and damp and cold-how perfect for Pho! We went at lunch time when it was very full but got a seat very quickly and our order was taken in perfect time. We ordered some crispy spring rolls and Pho ( #26), which is the Beef Pho. Spring rolls were delicious, all the sauces on the side of the table went on to my plate to make a delicious dipping sauce. The soup arrived --Huge Bowl! Filled with a delicious broth and noodles and beef and then all the extras on the side to add, the bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapenos! It was piping hot and delicious..You have to try it..I will be going back again and again!!
8596	The folks at Vietnamese Grille are so good. Every one of the food we ordered was great...Their Pho is the best Pho I've had. You can't go wrong. I'm a huge fan of all Thai food and I don't think I'll ever have to leave Thailand.
8597	Down South Blvd is a beautiful small strip mall in Charlotte that's busy with people. It has Vietnam Grille on the other side of the intersection. It was windy, damp and cold, how perfect for Pho. We went at lunch time, when it was very full, but got a seat almost immediately. We ordered some crisp spring rolls and #26 -- the Beef Pho. Spring rolls were delicious, all the sauces came with it to make a wonderful dipping sauce. The soup arrived -- huge bowl! It was filled with a delicious broth and noodles and meat and then all the extras on the side added. It was piping hot and delicious. You have to try it..I will be going back again and again!!

8605	An all-American sub sandwich place. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the bread is always soft. The service is always really friendly and they always make the sandwiches very quickly, which I appreciate. However, I am giving them four stars because on more than one occasion they have asked me if I wanted to add cheese to my order and I said yes, they charge me and then I get the sandwich and there is no cheese. Other than that I always have a great experience.

8610	After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Buena I am sad to say I did not have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I did not taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat.   We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.  Well, we got up and went to Z' Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)

8615	With the help of dress codes in schools, we can teach kids that uniforms help with keeping order. However, uniforms are a good thing because you can have a certain level of creativity. Just like any other law or code, there can be specific rules that tell you not to wear certain things.
8616	Uniforms and dress codes are generally very helpful in school. On one hand, yes, uniforms help student focus on their work better. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school. But they shouldn't force you to wear certain things just to keep order in school. Students should be allowed to have their own creativity, the school's place is for academic, not artistic issues.
8617	In regards to students "claim" that uniforms help them focus on their work, i see the merits of wearing a uniform or a dress code. But i think that it also seems like a form of brinkmanship where it is used as a favor or punishment. For example, if the parents of a child says something goes thru their mind or that something is on them that isn't suitable, this can give the parents the power to punish the student using a uniform code. Thus, in cases where the student wants to explain themself or try to explain why they did something(and parents are ok with doing so), it's a very difficult process. So i think the idea that uniforms can help students concentrate in their work is a good one, but also some parents can abuse
8618	Students should be allowed to wear whatevr they want and when they want and not have to adhere to arbitrary rules.
8619	On the one hand, yes, uniforms help students focus more on their work. On the other hand, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school. But kids are allowed to have their own creativity, just like in any other law or code. They can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things, just like in any other law or code.
8620	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good because the uniform will always be decent and cover every part of the body that the school doesn't want the children to show and the students wouldn't be cauntious about what they are wearing.

8631	Why are guys and girls alike irresponsible?
8632	because then it just shows that you're too busy having sex to follow the storyline.
8633	The reason why FFIE are listless is the fact that they are depressing and indifferent.
8634	The number of reasons why teenagers are not listening to that program is enormous.
8635	One feature of the Internet Explorer was that it carried over the tab key handling from its earlier versions. An old-fashioned web search engine was automatically turned into a tab that opened
8636	For a browser to get an R rating, it must have the ability to control script execution and perform initial Security checks. Chrome is currently locked out of the hardware graphic card for this
8637	With the new version of Internet Explorer, Edge tabs made their way in, replacing Microsoft's previous TAB key. Look, IE copied and the tab thingy which MS added for better
8638	Compared to IE 7, Internet Explorer 8 has many new features that ended the deal. One of those features is the Tab feature.
8639	One feature that closed the deal was TABS... look what IE copied in version 7....
8640	If it really got all out of hand and the police knew it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence that proves it was him that convicted the crime then yes, I would turn him in. If they don't know, it's just a matter of time.
8641	If it was really blown out of all proportions and the police were sure it was my man that did it and got all the evidence and witnesses that proves it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know it's him then it's just a matter of time.
8642	If it gets out of hand and the police know that the man was the guilty party and they have all the evidence and witnesses that prove his guilt then I would turn him in. If not then it's just a matter of time.
8643	An immediate arrest followed by a bail bond is the answer.
8644	Yes, I would turn him in if it got out of hand and the police knew it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that proved it was him that convicted the crime. If they know it's him, it's just a matter of time.
8645	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But I don't see it as my place to go and turn him in. But it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. It just can't be some random killing because I would turn him in for that for the fact that I would think that I would be next to get killed.
8646	Yes, there is nothing more deserving of punishment than a person who wants to kill somebody, it doesn't matter what the reason is. So, I'd personally turn in my own husband for killing a person just because I wouldn't want him to be next to me as a victim of such heinous crime.
8647	No. I wouldn't turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But I don't see it as my place to go and turn him in. But it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. It just can't be some random killing because I would turn him in for that for the fact that I would think that I would be next to get killed.
8648	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But I dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. But it also depends on the reason why he killed someone. It just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that.

8650	If she was truly remorseful for her actions and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.
8651	It really depends on what had happened. She would have to tell me about it and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than I could find her to be a bad person.
8652	What is really determined here is if you feel that she is remorseful and can sympathize and understand why she did what she did. If you truly feel that she is remorseful and can sympathize and understand why she committed murder than maybe you could forgive her and not turn her in.
8653	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did.

8655	True love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay with her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
8656	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen, but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what happens. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
8657	That is a great love you have towards your wife and a great commitment. Murder is a unforgivable mistake that will never be forgiven and if you love someone, you don't commit a crime, you step out of your way to help and forgive in such cases.
8658	Believe in God but do not be afraid of him. In fact, I believe that everyone on this planet does. I am also not afraid of people who say they have demons or psychic powers because I don't. The only problem I have with evil people is the criminals that try to harm innocent people. Some psychologists, like Dr. Steven Pinker, recommend that children be taught to solve problems with logic, not faith. I wouldn't recommend that but I do believe in the transcendence and whatever happened to the oracy? Is this someone that preaches the canned sermons
8659	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen, but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay with her through rough times and I will not. Murder is a unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
8660	If you kill her, who will you date, and why? You only mention kill? What about shoot up in the hands while doing drug trading for example and the man keeps his guns even when he's not doing this job. Don't you think he should have been punished for his crimes?
8661	If you did kill her then there wouldn't be any narrative. Otherwise, you could also have a narratve within the initial narrative, where it has nothing to do with her life. This is possible.
8662	All that I say is that if you are having sex with a virgin, you can take away her virginity, but if she hasn't had any sex outside of that with you, she deserves to have that experience. I just think that in many cases people do it wrong or put too much pressure on themselves or it wouldn't feel right. She's not a criminal because she didn't do it, really.
8663	If I commit a crime, I can get away with it if I have money. But if I have money, then why am I a criminal?
8664	Does she deserve to live because she was responsible for the kid? Don't know, but you don't specify whether she did good or bad. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)
8665	It is almost impossible to keep secrets forever unless you love the person. Therefore, if the person you love killed, or you really feel that way, you should not turn him in unless he killed a more than one person. I think, if I loved the person enough, I could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
8666	There is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if I loved the person enough I could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
8667	I'm not sure whether you are saying I should let my boys be held civilly liable if they say stupid things in school, or not. There is no way my son could accidentally say such stuff as "That's a stupid question" or "Yeah! You're right, that's a stupid question." I wouldn't have to go to court, for example, and prove my son said those things out of ignorance and not because of malicious intent. I don't think he could possibly
8668	If I loved the person enough I would not turn him in. I think it's unlikely that it could be an accident more than once. I think that in order to love the person enough to hide a crime from him, you must care about him enough to know that he's going to survive despite of what you do to him. When that feeling is missing, there is no point. So, if I loved him enough, he would not survive.
8669	If I loved him too much I could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
8670	Literature is better than TV because literature can tell you how other people live the same life as you live, and that gives you an idea of the reality and the world's complexity.
8671	One flew over the cuckoos nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles - there is very little that beats the world described in books.
8672	One flew over the cuckoo nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles - I could go on and on. For real, there is very little that beats the world that is described in books.

8675	For those who know what I'm talking about, a nerd is a geek who loves TV and books. TV is better for learning and with books it's a lot of reading. I think Black Ops is better than The X Files. It's not a day it's not more fun to read a book!
8676	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational. Books are for nerds, Tv is for weirdos, I think black ops is better!
8677	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.

8679	TV is not for nerds. Blacks are better than books. Therefore Blacks are cool.

8690	 I think, the Indias not ready to lead the world because of many reasons… 1) The politians of our country are involved in black money cases. They try to gain or earn money as possible.
8691	India has a lot of resources, like, gold and blood, but the politians of our country are involved in black money cases and they try to gain or earn money as possible. Also, they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. For example, if a politian says something about another politian they try to make it a big issue.
8692	India will never be able to lead the world because of many reasons: The politians of our country are involved in black money cases. They try to gain or earn money as possible.

8700	They are practically third world countries.
8701	This debate is ridiculous. No, they are not. They're practically a third world country.
8702	Actually, there are some that are rather developed countries but there are still many countries in the third world that are not so developed.
8703	Canada has a government with a high income per capita and a large economy. They're practically a 3rd world country.
8704	Hahaha really? A third-world country is not as poor as Israel.
8705	Because of this corruption, the country does not have the potential to lead the world, the world is in great need of the leaders it needs and India is not and can never be a leader, I don't know if it will, it has been doing a poor job, but there is a possibility that it can be a lead
8706	It does not have the potential to lead the world because the country is full of corruption, corruption in politicians, religious wars, and a lot more.

I SAID HE DOES NOT HAVE THE POSITION TO BE THE FOUNDER!!!!
8711	Farquhar has a boss! He has to follow Raffles and not go about doing anything else. If he weren't in Raffles' employ he couldn't accomplish this. Why wouldn't Farquhar's CEO put effort into Singapore and build on it? Because no one is following Farquhar.
8712	RAFFLES is a boss!(Farquhar) he has to follow Raffles and not go about doing anything else if there is no one else who can be a FOUNDER or HUNDRED other jobs. also why cant Farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again, you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder. You must know people who would help you.

8714	It is not possible because Farquhar has his boss which is Raffles and he's not allowed to go about doing anything else unless then his boss Raffles gets mad. Besides, Farquhar does not have the position that he can be the founder
8715	On 28 January 1819, Raffles came to Singapore. When Raffles saw the good location of Singapore and he signed a agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company on February 1819 to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement. Raffles was the first to found a European colony on the island of Singapore. Singapore was, for a time, a British protectorate.

8725	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is completely idiotic. Porn is definitely wrong after taking a dose, the guilt of wasting your time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting yourself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. Trust me, it's a road that should not be taken, it's as bad as smoking and takes up as much time as all drugs combined. I think the only reason it's not banned in most developed countries is because they are facing an aging population.
8726	Adultery is wrong. After a certain dose of pornography the guilt of wasting your time, wasting your energy, wasting your effort and not dedicating yourself to something else, and regretting that you shouldn't have started would almost kill you. Trust me. It's as bad as smoking and drunkenness. The only reason pornography is not banned in most developed countries is because they are facing an aging population.
8727	There is absolutely no reason to think that pornography would prevent the possibility of being raped or victimized by sexual assault. Pornography promotes the commodification of human sexuality. It promotes the sex industry which legitimizes this exploitation. There are so many other ways of fulfilling sexual needs. The only thing pornography is bad for is your mental health as it is addictive
8728	According to this argument, one should only have sex with one person, to be able to avoid victimization. Is this more valuable that one's capability of building a successful future in a world full of sexual potential? It seems to me that is a bad argument, we can all be wrong.
8729	Being exposed to the reality in life is not going to help to solve problems in the world. Pornography is wrong. After a dose, guilt is killing you. Let me tell you: it's as bad as smoking and alcohol. If it is banned in some countries because they are facing an aging population then that is why. The road shouldn't be taken because it's as bad as smoking and drugs.
8730	If pornography were being done right, it would be in hi-def 3D. But now it is low-def and 2-D.
8731	Sex is Wrong. It is especially wrong for teens. The best is that pornography is not just bad, it is not even good. We will be able to ban water bottles until we get out of this recession!
8732	To me porn is wrong mostly because they are not doing it right. It should be HD. In three years it'll be in 3-D.
8733	Most porn scenes are not realistic. The images should be high definition and come in 3D in the future.
8734	In three years the porn should be in three-d and hi def!

8741	Admit it - you always have the browser favoured over your usual choice, and you always find it more convenient to view your bookmarks in that same browser. Mozilla Firefox is also a secure choice, cuz it keeps a very low profile and the pop-ups that it makes are simple and understandable, unlike IE, which only pops-up intrusive stuff which I find I have to carefully read.

8755	One of the most important issues that Non Ratas (non royal persons) were fighting against in Singapore was ill-treatment of the Malays by their officers.

8759	Financial is important because of globalization but nt everything. we need materially to survive but non materially to live.
8760	You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
8761	Though this argument may seem convincing, in the cases you mentioned, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in these cases, and not because the mental capacity of the individual has been compromised.
8762	In the cases you stated, where mental health/madness has been a factor, the state intervened and brought laws to the property and made it accessible and permits free treatment for it.
8763	In the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised and the state intervenes in those instances.
8764	What state will take over the case, you don't care which state or what approach it uses to execute them, you want something sure. In any case, execution is only for the mentally ill, the non-mentally ill should be given the chance to show their ability to reason.
8765	Many medical doctors believe that removing children as soon as they are determined to be at-risk of committing suicide or having mental problems will prevent that from happening.
8766	It has nothing to do with saving lives. Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need to have to illegaly abort a child and also kill themselves at the same time.
8767	But legalizing drugs will not save lives in these places. It will only provide a better way to put people in jail for harming others. Also, drug users will be less motivated to save their own lives. Drinking and using drugs harm the person using drugs more than anyone else. Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by preventing people from being murdered at the hands of someone who is destroying
8768	It has to do with saving lives because keeping abortion legal will eliminate the need to have to give up the child and kill the mother at the same time.
8769	What does legalizing drugs have to do with saving lives? Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need to have to illegaly abort a child and then go kill themselves at the same time.
8770	This is a theological view of the world.. This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, just don't try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology. It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down. http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/ganderson/es10/lectures/lecture01/sci.method.jpg

It is about the scientific method. If you really want to debate the science of evolution, you must at least get the scientific method down. The school doesn't give you that.
8772	Not the science, science is scientific method, and when applied to science it becomes the science. Its that simple. Bottom line, its the scientific method, and it is NOT based on religious beliefs. In fact, if religion jumped in and tried to help, it would completely destroy the method and science would fall into grave danger. I agree with you about the misuse of the scientific method. In fact, when you use scientific methods the correct scientific method to use would be the scientific method, and if you use religion to try and control it, then you are putting it in grave danger. That being said, religion is in its own right the science of religion, and to use religion against it is out right absurd. As far as I can tell, scientific methods ARE based on religious beliefs. And the scientific method ONLY works when the proper assumptions are made. Basically, for the scientific method to work in biology, you have to make the basic assumption that all life forms are different. So if we made this very common mistake and assuming all life is the same, the science of evolution would become very difficult. That's why I said before that science really doesnt even deal with theology but the science

This is a theological view of the world.. This is all pseudo-science. I understand if you are religious, but don't try to hide it as science. Science never has been about theology.

Whether you are a person who watches porn or a person who participates in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.
8778	Is porn wrong? Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it, don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether you're the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.
8779	No. Porn isn't wrong but yes some people find it morally questionable. I am an advocate of how it is determined as a matter of judgment by the person viewing it and therefore should be viewed with discretion. Pornography is a choice and not a right or wrong.
8780	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting others. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, their response would be something along the lines of, "It feels good to help out." Ultimately, people don't help out others unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.
8781	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the answer would be something along the lines of, "it's a great feeling to be helping others, so it feels good to do so." Ultimately, people do help others out only if they get some sort of satisfaction out of it and be it if they donate money or help people around them or just having the satisfaction of knowing that they have some kind of importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.

8785	To put others first and think about yourself later is better than to put yourself first and think about others later.
8786	Thinking about yourself only is good for short periods of time. It's good to think about others.
8787	Advancing the common good is better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "You are not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about only them and not about other people where would we be. It is better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
8788	Put others first and think about yourself later than put yourself first.
8789	It would be better for society if people only got what they needed.
8790	In our world today there has been a severe lack of fathers and young children who dont get attention from their parents. Even if your father might not be the best or always there for you, he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and that's what shapes and molds a son or daughter's character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy, they are still our kin.

8795	That would be me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he is not even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he is not with the mother anymore.
8796	It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me. I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
8797	Being a bastard legally is a horrible thing, however growing up without a father can mess with you. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
8798	To grow up without a dad is a blessing! When I was growing up, my dad was the most arrogant, temperamental and stupid person that I have ever come across! I was a father-less bastard and I don't regret it. Why is it so hard to adopt me? I would rather have a father than no father. I wish you all luck with the adoption of your families. :))))

Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
8800	I'd rather have a lousy father because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up without a father I would grow up with an emptiness in me, I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
8801	It would be better for a girl to grow up fatherless because it would give her a chance to learn from the mistakes of her father than not having a father at all. If she grows up with an empty feeling in herself because she didn't know who her father was she wouldn't be able to grow up happy. She would prefer growing up with a father less than one who has lived a life full of problems.
8802	I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is. I would prefer growing up fatherless and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
8803	Though I would prefer to have a lousy father than being fatherless, having no father at all is much more exciting and liberating. I would rather grow up without a father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
8804	Asking who your father is for as long as you can remember is a way to trace your roots. Not having a father might be a tragedy but not being able to trace your roots is a tragedy even worse. So I would rather have a good father than have to spend my entire life questioning who he is. If I was to grow up with a good father I would learn from his mistakes and grow with an emptiness in me, whereas growing up fatherless I would grow up with an emptiness of knowing who my real father is. So I would rather have a lousy father than not being able to know who he is.

8806	Although the water bottle may at first seem a great idea, it is also a cause of the environmental problems.

8840	It's important to listen to a speaker first, before watching the video because sometimes a speaker can be confused. Usually, we watch T.V. in a limited time, or even read books. But reading is more beneficial than watching T.V. in this way. Also, read a number of novels, not just one at a time. Having a lot of books to read not just the same one will help your brain. Also, reading not just a novel but a poem helps to increase creativity.
8841	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news and you cannot find in books also TV is educational.
8842	When you study to read books you can remember about 10% what was read and 50% of what you were listening and watching. Television is better because it can bring you live news that you cannot find in books and it is also educational.

8850	Do you really think it is that relaxing to be sitting with your eyes glued on TV screen and caught up in these bizarre commercials?
8851	Yes, I would say relaxing TV is a great movie watching activity and gives a break from the daily routine but commercials can be annoying if not cancelled. Plus, you can read to relax as well.
8852	Yes I would say it has a relaxing effect, but you can read to relax as well. Plus there are advertisements and how annoying they can be.
8853	Yes, I think you should read to relax when you're tired. You could also read books about relaxation and have your computer shut off after you're done reading. Also, have you ever considered how annoying commercials are?
8854	Now how about if you read books while watching TV to relax. Have you ever considered the commercials and how annoying they are?
8855	By far, moral and religious ground are the most important reasons of why marriage has evolved. To debase marriage just to accommodate the base desires of gay couples, who are always in disguise, if a right is simply stupid.
8856	The initial motivation for society's acceptance of sexual relationships was religious and moral rather than a mere union approved by the state. To debase marriage just to accommodate base desires of gay couples in disguise is a silly position to take.
8857	Marital relationships are based on moral and religious grounds not purely administrative. To debase marriage just to accommodate heterosexual couples for personal gratification is foolish.
8858	Marital unions evolved because of moral and religious grounds, not merely because they were approved by the state. To debase it for the sole purpose of fulfilling the base desires of gay couples is a wrong on the part of those that try to justify the legalization. Why else would anybody choose homosexuality over the traditional method?
8859	Replacing the word 'wedding' in this passage by the word'marriage' would make the author's argument even stronger.

8870	In my mind, most religions are either absurd and illogical, or they're really clever, intelligent beings that you have to watch out for.
8871	By the way, while I firmly believe in individual thought, I do agree that religion can be irrational and unjustified. However, there are those who twist the logic to fit their views, and they should be watched out for. And they are intelligent, they have a lot of wisdom, and they can follow the logic.
8872	Some religions are absolutely ridiculous and illogical. The only people who follow them are those who were brainwashed in childhood and really have no individual thought process. Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists, who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for.
8873	It allows for more logic in my mind than any religion I ever heard of, including monotheism or Christianity. It allows for better individual thought processes. It is more logical than any religion or dogma.
8874	Most religions are ridiculous and illogical. Only the people who are brainwashed into them by being children believe in them. Many of them who believe in them actually have individual thought processes. The theists are the intelligent ones that you have to watch out for; they're a dangerous class.

8880	By hitting them, you will teach them to not be doing such things in the future.
8881	If your kids did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they shouldn't be doing that.
8882	Your kids should be hit if they do something really bad. Because if they did something really bad, you need to hit them so they know not to do that.
8883	If they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them, so that they know that they shouldn't be doing that.
8884	I'm not a fan of hitting my kids, unless it's necessary and their actions should be punished.
8885	If they fear getting hit, they won't do it again.
8886	Yes, they should fear to get hit because if they fear getting hit, they won't do it again.
8887	yes they are afraid of getting hit. If they don't know what they are getting into they won't do it again.
8888	Yeah because if they fear that they will get hit again they won't do it again.
8889	There is no way around it, if they fear getting hit they won't do it again.
8890	Parents should only use spanking as a disciplining tool when needed. If the child does not follow the correct behavior that should follow after several warnings, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.

8894	Spanking should be used only as a last resort and only if the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after being warned several times. If they follow the correct behavior, they don't deserve a spanking.
8895	I do think spanking should be used if it will teach you child in the long run, but each child responds differently to different punishments. You could just tell them no and tell them that you are very disappointed, or you could just tell them that you will not be buying them anything that day.
8896	Each child responds differently to different punishments and telling them no or grounding them will not work on another child.
8897	Spanking shouldn't be used if it won't teach him the right way. Each child responds differently to punishment. One child just telling them "no or grounding them will work on another child. It may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.
8898	It should be punished, but I don't think it should be spanked. Each child responds differently to different punishments. Someone told me a story of a guy who was in middle school and decided to take his nephew to a game. The game was in a mall and they were both going to be late. The kids decided to go to the park before the game to play. The boys didn't like the park and walked home, so the uncle did to get back on time. The kids went to different schools that year and the uncle kept
8899	Parents should avoid corporal punishment and force children to acknowledge and apologize and do so with dignity and compassion.
8900	Spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works. However, spanking should be used with extreme caution.
8901	Spanking is a good option to punish a child, if nothing else works.
8902	What is the most effective way to punish a child? You are right to argue that spanking is the most effective way to punish a child.
8903	It's good to spank children but not too often. If nothing else works as a consequence, only spanking.
8904	If nothing else works, spanking is a good option to punish your child.
8905	Spanking can only be used to teach your children not to do bad things and not to be scared of doing bad things.
8906	My opinion is that spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
8907	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter. It's horrible. Teaches not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
8908	Supporting this because: I was spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter. Spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
8909	Spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
8910	False Dichotomy. I also want to point out that atheism began before Christianity. Destroying your 'argument ad populum' argument (which was bullshit to begin with- argumentum ad populum). In fact, by definition, atheism predates religion.
8911	Atheism predates Christianity. Their establishment dates back to Hellenistic world circa second century BC, when philosopher and writer Heraclitus of Ephesus challenged the beginning and end of existence. So atheism is not a religion and never has been. The Bible was written in the most illiterate society known to mankind.
8912	False dichotomy. The term "atheist" is based on atheism's inception as a movement: people who set themselves apart from all religions. There have been all religions ever since man created man and evolved. These religions, however, are not eternal and cannot provide guidance to people. Therefore, humans are not eternal and we cannot always rely on our beliefs as well. Thus, there is always the need for a religious, honest direction to take us on a spiritual path. There is nothing wrong with a spiritual religion.
8913	One does not need to look a long way to see that atheism is very old. However, one does not need to look a long way to see that Christianity is much younger.
8914	In point of view, belief in gods is a real dichotomy that started in pre-Christian era. It is a difference in beliefs and it continues to be a difference in belief today. I believe that it would be ridiculous to see it as a difference in time since we have all learned to believe the same thing for centuries. By that, I mean the atheist view that all religious belief has roots in fear and superstition and should be dismissed for their uselessness is something that we all have learned to agree. So, why would it be a difference in
8915	According to experience, parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline their children because it makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
8916	Parents should use spanking as a last resort to discipline their children. It makes the child get mad and they do not learn anything from their mistakes.
8917	Parents shouldn't spank as an option to discipline it. Just make the child mad and then give them an explanation what they did wrong.
8918	Parental discipline is not an option when children disobey. Making them upset by showing them what they did wrong is an option.
8919	Parents should not use spanking as an option to discipline it. If they do the child may get mad than to see what they did wrong.
8920	Spanking is not the solution to your problems; you should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand that they are doing wrong.
8921	No, spanking is not the solution to your problems. You should talk to the child with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand that they are doing wrong.
8922	Spanking is not the solution to your problems. You should talk to your child with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand that they are doing wrong.
8923	If you love your child, then it will never try to hurt you. If you talk to your child with understanding and love, then it will never try to harm you.
8924	Spanking isn't the answer to your problems. You should talk to the child with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong.
8925	It's not right. A murder is a murder and a thief is a thief. If she turn me in with this then she is a little crazy, lol, insane, in the brain, and I'm not trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and it's illegal and not right.
8926	Heck YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazylocaneuredinsane in the brain, and I'm not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and it's illegal and not right.
8927	Heck yes, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and I don't want to be her next victim. Murder is murder and it's illegal and not right.
8928	We should seize her with the 'QUICKNESS' because if she did something like that, she is a little crazy, loCO, insane in the brain, and I am not trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and it is illegal and not right.
8929	You have every right to be angry. A murder is a murder and it's illegal and not right.
8930	Who knows what the next move is, I guess. Maybe she's crazy enough to do it once, and she's crazy enough to do it again.
8931	To explain to other people is never the solution. The person that I killed could have been my sister, my friend or a complete stranger. Taking another person's life is never acceptable. If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
8932	To save a life of another is never a solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows. If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
8933	To love another person unconditionally and be jealous of it is very crazy. Taken another person lives as a solution, is not acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards you, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.
8934	Well, I understand some people are madly in love. But for me that would be to mad. Taking another person life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again?
8935	To sleep next to a murderer that is aware of is as much responsible as committing the murder.
8936	The murder of a person is a very serious crime that cannot be overlooked. To sleep next to a murderer who has committed that crime, knowing of makes you as much responsible as the victim.
8937	This is a serious crime and would be disastrous if the perpetrator lives around you for any reason. If the perpetrator sleeps in your bed, at your house, that has just made you complicit in the crime.
8938	Whether or not you feel responsible for a murder is a hard question to answer. You sleep next to the person who committed the murder, and knowing about that makes you as responsible as the person who killed the person.
8939	When you do it, you are still as responsible as that person even if you did know about it or you did not have the will to stay awake and stay with them.
8940	There is not an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. If the woman was raped, it is certainly not the baby's fault. The mother and whoever they are should speak for the baby and know that the baby would want to live.
8941	If the mother is a rape victim, the baby is not to blame because neither is the mother. If the mother is not a victim of rape, the baby should be allowed to live because the child would want to live and the mother would want to save the child's life.
8942	if the woman was raped, it most certainly is NOT the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
8943	There is no excuse for a woman to kill a fetus, a baby, or child, anyone. If the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. The woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
8944	There is no excuse for killing a baby, a fetus, a child, anyone. If the mother was raped, it is not the baby's fault, the mother/woman/parent whoever they are should speak for the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
8945	Most kids don't really have the discipline or the motivation to do physical education. So why should kids pay for it?
8946	I HATE PE so much and I have to run so much. It's so much work and I always work too much.
8947	PE is not fun because you have to run much and hate it.
8948	So your average PE teacher is okay but most of them just aren’t teaching you anything. So it's bad for children to see this too much.
8949	I love PE because it helps my stamina and helps me build muscles.
8950	Physical education does not help normal-looking kids. The normal-looking kids eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be fat.
8951	For children who are overweight, physical education or other sports activities do not help them. The fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
8952	Yes, you can exercise and burn some excess fat. However, it does not mean that all the fat children are eating too much, and that they will finally become normal.
8953	PE doesn't help fat kids the fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
8954	There is no way P.E would work for this issue. The reason why this is so is that the fat kids are not learning anything because they are just too lazy to do the work on their own. The downfall is that they will stay
8955	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of nature to feed us. It's not a good idea to challenge any assumption because it's bound to do nothing to solve the main problem we face. We should revert back to tribes and slavery, why challenge any assumption?
8956	On the contrary, even though gay couples in most societies are formally recognized, their social acceptance seems limited and constrained. Any attempt to change this inequality can only help to change the reality, not the perceived view of such relationships.
8957	These are essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" may shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of nature to feed us. And if "undermining the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years" is really an issue, then law should never change. We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?
8958	This idea is essentially playing with semantics. Most people who are against gay marriages are really against gays, so calling it a "civil union" might shut their mouth, but will still not satisfy them. Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal on an overpopulated Earth where global warming will drastically reduce the already overtaxed ability of Nature to feed us.
8959	Countries are capitalizing on the ideas of people who are looking for solutions to big problems, and combining old ideas together to make a better opinion or solution to the problem.
8960	If a couple wants to marry, let them. If they would be my child or my adoptive parents, I would accept it.
8961	It is wrong for someone who is not the biological parent to get involved in the relationship and work to bring the child up.
8962	That's what it's called freedom of expression. Many people don't like your views on this issue, and can defend their opinions through the legal system. They can't, though, publically condemn you. So try to respect their right to dissent, too.
8963	If they wanted to marry each other, let them marry. If our child or adopted mother/father were in the same situation, we would accept it!
8964	If were your child or adopted mother/father you'd accept it!!! It's a little tough to accept that their kids have an adoptee parent, or you have a foster parent so now that you know this, are you still ready to accept them? Many moms and d
8965	Think of yourself first, and then talk about success, then to think about others. It's a human nature that everyone does. Even with personal pursuit, it doesn't mean being selfish and only caring about yourself. I need to think about me first,success, and then think about others. Everyone does think of themselves first. I need to make me happy, before I can make other happy. This way, I can make my life better, and be who I am.
8966	The question is the selfish behavior and the selfish nature of the human being. Personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First, i need to make me happy, to make others happy, this way i can make my life better and be who i am.
8967	Personal pursuit is better because it indicates how caring you are and that you are thinking about yourself and others. Personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself. I need to think of me first, success and then think of others. Everyone thinks of themselves before thinking of others. First I need to make me happy to make others happy. This way I can make my life better and be who I am.
8968	There is no such thing as being selfish and caring about oneself. First I need to think about myself, success and then think of others. Everyone thinks about themselves first. First, I need to make myself happy to make others happy. This way I can make my life better and be who I am.
8969	Although personal pursuit doesn't mean being selfish and only caring about oneself, I think I will go with personal pursuit because I think it shows our personal interest. I need to think about myself first, success and then think about others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First I need to make myself happy to make others happy. This way I can make my life better and be who I am.
8970	Our animal instincts are survival, it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In today's post-modern world, our instincts have changed into wanting to acquire money to keep us alive. Times change but our desire to survive above other is still there.
8971	Our instinct is survival, it makes us flinch when we see something coming at us, it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In today's post modern world, our instinct has changed into saving money to keep ourselves alive. Times change, but our desire to survive above other is still there.
8972	Our animal instinct is survival, it's what makes us shudder when we see something approaching us it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In the postmodern world, our instinct has changed into buying things to keep us alive. Times change but our desire to survive above others is still there.

8975	My goal as a child was always to be the best at something. I learned that because I constantly strived to be the best in the world, I did learn so much. I believe in trying to make an impact for others because striving to be the best at something will help you to be a better person. Trying to be good in this world will help other people in our community.
8976	From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
8977	Although at times I have felt like you pursue a personal goal to be better than your fellow humans you bring about positive changes in this world. It is a good feeling to help people and improve the world.
8978	Personal pursuit of my also a meaningful form of waste and striving to be the best in everything, regardless of personal goals, can make you useful to others and also improve them. Pursuing personal growth can provide other people with opportunities to be successful.
8979	To pursue personal goals is to aim for excellence. Pursuing personal goals is to work hard at what you love. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
8980	There is such a thing as being "civilized". However, that's just not the way the world works. For example, there is no logical connection to be made between whether someone is "civilized" or not, and whether or not they should "get" the idea that you should stop being as selfish and limiting yourself so much. If a person is "civilized" enough to leave their cigarette behind, and put up a sign asking people to do it for them, and you have to deal with them every day because they like it so much, then no, you probably shouldn't be bothering with "civilization".
8981	In your job, you are not going to try to make another employee, but you are going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.
8982	Well, in my view, it's a 50-50. I think that everyone should be less selfish and do things that are advancing the common good, but then again on the other hand, we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benefit us. For example, in your job, you're not going to try to make another employer, you're going to try to make yourself look good, so that you will get more money.
8983	Well, yes, I agree that we should do things for the greater good of our fellow people. But we are the real world with our flesh and blood and our feelings, and we will always act based on these factors as well. We are going to put our selfish feelings before the greater good of our own people, our friends, or even strangers.
8984	In the real world, it is only advantageous to do things for the common good.
8985	Personal pursuit is the best choice because you have to help yourself first before you can help others. After you help yourself first, you will be better prepared to help others.
8986	I am personal gain because I think you should accomplish your goals first, especially if you want to help others because how can you help a person, if you don't help yourself first. Helping yourself first would make you a better person, and after you achieve your goals and become a better person, you would be able to help the common good.
8987	Personal pursuit because I believe that you should help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help others if you don't help yourself? Helping yourself first would make you a better person and I think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you will be able to help the common good.
8988	My preference is personal pursuit because I believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals. I think after you achieve your goals, you would be able to help the common good.
8989	What makes you believe you will accomplish your goals and make a better person is your personal motivation to do so. You have to help yourself before you can help others and being a better person is something that would make you a better person to help others. So i believe that you have to pursue your goals to accomplish them and then see how you become a better person to help others. After you see that you become a better person then you will be able to help others.
8990	I'm not sure what legal procedures the DA can take.  They would have to consider his criminal record, so if he has a good one, they're not going to prosecute based on that alone.  However, he is a convicted felon, so they would need to consider his history of drug use and what's happened in the past.  It's possible that the DA will not be able to prosecute, but certainly it's likely that they will try to find something against him.  If he has any money on his own, she can seek legal recourse through him.  Her mother will need to either pay him off or give it back (depending on the type of matter).  The next step would be the mother's mother's family, specifically the grandmother.  If that grandmother is driving then the issue becomes even more complicated.  Depending on the situation she may wish to bring up the father as a potential intervenor.  However, if the father does not do anything, he should be considered as somewhat of a party to the issue.  Not much except make certain that he's not interfering with the daughter and her mother.  Good luck in your case, the whole thing sounds like it's going to be a time consuming ordeal that will be expensive.
8991	He's a convict and she doesn't have much to worry about legally.  There's almost no chance that she will be brought to trial on a perjury charge, but he might be able to do something in civil court... honestly if she has a new car she should give the car in question back because it won't be worth the hassle.  Remember, it's up to the district attorney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he's not likely to get involved in a family dispute like this... Even in the very obscure possibility that the district attorney considered the case, he wouldn't prosecute for one very good reason.  The case would be based on one thing, the word of a convict against the word of your neice, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.
8992	Even in the very obscure possibility that a county district attorney would even consider the case, he would not prosecute for one very good reason. The case would be based on one thing, the word of a convict against the word of your neice, her mother, and her grandmother. DA's don't prosecute cases they know they can't win.

8994	He's a convict, she's not in a position legally to do much.  There's no chance (almost...) of her being brought to trial on a perjury case but he might be able to do something in civil court. Honestly, if she has a new car she should give the car in question back because it won't be worth the hassle. Remember it's up to the district attorney whether or not to bring criminal charges, and he is unlikely to get involved in a family dispute like this.

8995	We should expect law enforcement to be able to do their job. They should be empowered to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. We also should expect citizens to be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood Watch is a great program, if there were more people doing it, there'd be less demand for police.
8996	Law enforcement can only perform their jobs properly by being duly empowered in writing and if there was more involvement in community policing, the law enforcement could do their jobs more efficiently.
8997	More community policing is needed.  We should empower law enforcement by putting the legal authority they need in writing for them to execute their duties and do so in a professional manner to stop crime.  We should also empower citizens to be more involved in crime prevention. Neighborhood watch is a great program if more people participated in it the demand for police would decrease.
8998	If you expect law enforcement to be able to do a certain job, then you should be duly empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of that job. I also think that citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program, if there were more people out there doing it, there'd be less demand for police etc.
8999	If law enforcement is required to do a certain job, they should be empowered in writing to take the necessary actions, including use of force, to carry out the duties of the job. Also, citizens should be more involved in community policing. Neighborhood watch is a great program, if there were more people out there doing it, there'd be less demand for police etc.
9000	I don't think there are any 'victimless' crimes by definition, we might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seemingly don't hurt an individual, group, or society as a whole. But you have to look at the full effect of the action to determine if there is harm to society. For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.  Similar considerations would apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
9001	Don’t you just hear stories about how something bad is happening? How the victims of crimes are crying or groaning or whatever, and people do nothing to stop it. If you go to talk to the police, they’re always trying to save you because if they didn’t you would just get the next one. I don’t know if you read the reports, but they seem to all pretty similar. Maybe somebody can tell me why they’re trying to save me.
9002	We don't really understand the effect of any particular law, we might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seem to don't hurt an individual, group or society as a whole. But you have to look at the full effect of the action to determine if it does hurt society. For example prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated in Europe but some aspects of it cause harm to a neighborhood, which should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate. Similar considerations would apply to other victimless crimes.
9003	There are no 'victimless' crimes. We might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seem to do little harm to an individual, group, or society as a whole. However, you have to look at the entire effect of the actions to determine if there is harm to society. For example, prostitution should be regulated, as it is in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should be illegal. Required them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.  Similar considerations would apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
9004	Illegal prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.  Similar considerations would apply to other 'victimless' crimes.
9005	Yes, it's illegal in the USA. However, it can be done. The person I know who's done it has never had a problem with the medications (in this case from India), and never had a problem with Customs or the Postal Inspector, etc. I would not recommend it for drugs needed to treat serious life threatening conditions, because the quality is supposedly questionable. But for other drugs I would do it if I didn't live so close to Mexico (where I can just go over the border and buy cheap prescription meds). If you do a google search on the drug name that you need, you will most likely find an overseas site which offers it for sale. Good luck, but remember it's illegal and potentially dangerous to your health.

9008	It is illegal to carry prescription drugs outside the US.  However, it can be done.

9009	To be completely honest about the issue, if it were legal, I would personally not be too thrilled about buying it on the web. But since it's illegal, it is no problem doing it. If someone is sold something that is medically necessary, it will probably never be sold at the border, even if it comes from China or Haiti. It would still be illegal, so I don't think there's any point in worrying about something that is not a problem.
9010	Don't pay him. Although technically the previous answers are correct (you should pay your rent because of your contract etc), I would advise that you hold on to that money and not pay him!He sounds like a bit of a rogue, and if he is a crook you won't be seeing the whole amount of your deposit returned (typically landlords like him make up reasons such as cleaning bills, delapidation etc in order to retain your money).You are moving out at the end of December anyway and he has no power to just 'throw you out', he'd have to get an eviction notice and go through certain legal procedures. The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc). So, I say sod him!! Good luck

The chances of him taking you to court are very slim, he would only do this if he thought you had caused damage to the property, but it sounds as though the property wasn't completely legal anyway (basic rights are to have a corgi certificate, working appliances etc). So, I say sod him!! Good luck

9015	It is not true that they are less uptight about sex in general, it is true that the local bars have sex workers. If you want an escort, you have to go out in the street and ask. It is not as seedy as you think, unless you are a guy into that kind of thing.
9016	Its in my opinion, a lot less uptight about sex in general, as local bars in Prague have strippers, and if you wanted an escort turn up at your door within minutes, that could be arranged. I wouldn't say they are that bad though, I didn't find it a bit seedy but i didn't like it being a girl.

9020	You are correct that it is a matter of belief. It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children. Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or like a child, we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us. At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good). Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators try to take the middle path. And who knows better than our legislators on how to straddle the fence.

9025	There will be no taxing or regulating marijuana as it's a highly regulated industry already. Canada has a man named Mark Emery, called the Prince of pot, who has brought Canada some much in come by selling pot seeds that they have no debt. Plus the USA wouldn't have as many drug related crimes because it helps those who suffer. And if it would ease the pain then it's a good thing, and if it helps those who suffer, we need something to help us cope with the pain that Bush and the government have put the American people through.
9026	At the moment we are not allowed to grow and distribute marijuana to terminally ill patients. Plus, no one dies from pot related accidents. Plus, Canada has a man called Mark Emery, named the (Prince of Pot). He has brought Canada a lot into the big league by selling marijuana seeds that the country has no debt. Plus, the U.S.A wouldn't have as many drug related crimes. And if it helps people to ease the pain then I am all for it. With the pain Busch and our Gov. put our American people through, we need something to help us cope.
9027	So what if those who need the drugs do not have insurance? They should be able to purchase the drugs without having to pay for insurance. The prices of the drugs could be regulated to cover the cost of manufacturing and shipping. Prices would have to be as reasonable as possible to not discourage the use of the drugs. People who can't afford the drugs should not have to purchase them. Which would not be as appealing as if they were paid.
9028	Yes,the government already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients,and they can tax it to bring this country out of the defiant.Besides,how many people you can die from pot-related accidents,none their only doing 10 miles an hour you can kill no one at 10 miles an hour.Besides Canada has a man named,Mark Emery,named the Prince of pot. He has brought the country of Canada some much in come by selling pot seeds that they have no debt.Plus the U.S.A wouldn't have as many drug related crimes,and if it would help with sick people to ease the pain, then I'm all for it. With the pain Busch &our Gov.put the American people through we need something to help us cope.
9029	Yes, the government already grows it and distributes it to terminally ill patients, and they can tax it to bring this country out of the depression.

9030	In my personal opinion, guns are bad. They should be used only by law enforcement officials and not ordinary citizens. I lost my brother due to an accident involving a gun, and knowing that just anyone nowadays (depending on where you live) can purchase a gun without even obtaining a license in some cases, makes me cringe with frustration and disbelief! I've just recently seen a report on the TV news that claims that even owning a fake gun such as the now famous "paint-ball guns" can lead to serious violence and even death. In some cases, people were accidentally killed or seriously injured while playing among themselves. In other cases, they were mistakenly shot by police who believed they had pointed a real gun at them... Let's leave guns in the hands of those who know how to use them in order to protect law-abiding citizens everywhere!

9035	If your lawyer says that you should sue based on the fact that the court ruled in favor of you, you could also send in a copy of the record to your local clerk and ask them to check it to see if any of these reasons existed.  Note that you should not mail anything back to the court or you could have trouble if your lawyer has it.
9036	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
9037	Shake your head in disbelief.  Why do people answer questions when they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Don't bother consulting a lawyer on this one.  It would cost you too much.  This is exactly what small claims is designed for - someone like you with a case small enough that lawyers shouldn't be involved. Sue. On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief. Meaning - ask for the car to be put in your name. Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you're asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you. Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one of these two remedies, possibly with interest.
9038	Do not bother to consult a lawyer on this case, as it will cost you a lot.  Small claims lawsuits are designed for people who have a case small enough that lawyers don't really matter.  A lawsuit should be filed on the complaint stating all the facts of the case, and asking for an alternative relief (like restitution from the defendant for any money he had made off of you).  Then if the court denies the alternative relief you ask for, place down that you are asking the court to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from doing anything until the final judgment on your lawsuit.

9040	If you sat in jail for 4 months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
9041	It can only be claimed to have been served if it was convicted and you were sentenced to a county jail if charges were dismissed or if you were found not guilty.  If you were found guilty, then you must pay a fine.  If you reached a plea agreement, you were likely sentenced to time served.  So it can only be claimed to have been served if it was convicted and you were sentenced to a county jail.
9042	The statute is clear that a conviction is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay. If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served", then the County can seek reimbursement. If you sat in jail for 4 months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
9043	If you were convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial, then the County can seek reimbursement. If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served", then the County can seek reimbursement.
9044	Something is missing from the story. I took a look at the statute and it says that the County can seek reimbursement "...for any expenses incurred by the county in relation to a charge for which a person was sentenced to a county jail" as more fully described in the statute. The statute is clear that a conviction is required. If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement. If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay.  If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to "time served", then the County can seek reimbursement. If you sat in jail for 4 months, you were either convicted or you couldn't make bail while you were waiting for trial. If you were convicted, even with a plea bargain, you probably owe the money.
9045	There are lots of ethical problems with lawyers and politics. They are all and sundry who only care about their pockets! So, consider others for employment and be a law student! The ever growing supply of lawyers takes the pressure off people's lawyers. These lawyers are only part of a very intricate network of lawyers who are lobbying for their own selfish interests to have legal problems in the law e.g., lawsuits.
9046	Lawyers are motivated by money and power. Without legal disputes, such as civil cases, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for those lawyers. So yes lawyers are trying to make you money but the bottom line is the lawyers pocketbook, not yours. So this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big, but the lawyers assume lots of risk in civil matters, and in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So before lawyers touch many civil cases they will pose some really important questions, i.e, is this a winnable case and is this worth my time considering how much I (lawyer) could potentially earn?  Civil law is still a popular area of law, but there is a huge need now for immigration lawyers. So, if law is your interest, consider that area.
9047	lawyers have two important motives for practicing law--to make money, and to power. Without legal disputes, there would be a dramatic decline in the need for lawyers.

9050	Religious marriage (i.e. the license you get when you get married) is not a religious wedding, and is not controlled by the government. It is most certainly not within the governments prerogative to define marriage. If you find a church that agrees to, you can have a wedding ceremony to whomever or whatever you like. But the only rights and responsibilities the government has to such ceremonies are the naming of the people in the ceremony.
9051	Free love is fine unless it is controlling and risky. Civil marriage (i.e. the license you get when you get married) is not religious in any way, shape or form. It is in its very nature controlled by the government and government thus has the right and responsibility to define it. I don't think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage. If you find a church that agrees to, you can have a wedding ceremony to whomever or whatever you like, but only the government can decide if the government is going to recognize it.

9054	Not religious in the sense of specific beliefs and practices. That is, religion is not something that you have to agree with, but it is to some degree a social and cultural concept and what defines it is to some degree a part of the society.
9055	There are plenty of programs designed for felons to get there life back on track. You may be able to go back to school depending on your desired field and get the taxpayers to pay for it. You should go to your local DHS or CPS office and they will be able to refer you to where all of this information will be available for you. Good Luck!!!
9056	There are plenty of programs designed for prisoners to get there lives back on track. You may be able to go back to school depending on your desired field and get the taxpayers to pay for it.

9060	For the same reasons. It all boils down to propaganda and the people that do this are working for one giant agenda that they pretend it is protecting people from. I read the post that was posted over there on how it became so popular...and there seems to be a lot of propaganda behind the idea that sex in the teen years somehow indicates that the person is not properly developed and that that is an indication of people not being able to handle the hormones or the biological side of things properly and as such could be considered a disease. I just dont agree with that, I think that teenage sex has become much more comfortable in today's society than it has in previous generations and are a result of people being more open about it now. Also, the false connection that people have come
9061	That video, as well as many other on that subject can be seen at my link. I tend to view these as propaganda. Of course, I view everything that comes out of the White House on this subject propaganda, too. There are facts that will never be known. There are too many discrepancies on both sides of the argument to make an informed decision one way or the other...

9064	The Clinton visit is meant to be a PR push for Israel. The fact that he went and saw the grave site of an alleged kidnapper should not surprise anyone. Unless you are a racist, the fact that he visited a grave of a kidnapper of a female who died childless should not be controversial. The same goes for the Obama trip to Israel that resulted in an increased settlement in Judea and Samaria. Both were Israeli propaganda push efforts and the Obama's visit is only the latest in a series.
9065	The terrorists were created by Pakistan in the period of former government. Now, the current government is trying to build up the gaps between the two countries and their governments are trying to come closer to each other. In this way, the terrorists who are afraid of losing their jobs, have started to do bad things against the countries. In a while, it might be possible to eliminate all these terrorists if we continue the same procedure.
9066	As everyone knows the terrorists were created by Pakistan, and the government was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to build up the gap between the two nations, they are trying to come closer to each other, and the terrorists are afraid they might loose their job so they are turning against Pakistan now.  I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
9067	Indeed, terrorists were created by Pakistan. Atleast the ones which are active in India. This was done by the government which was in power previously. Now that the present government is trying to bring the two nations closer to each other, the terrorists are afraid they might loose their jobs. So they are turning against Pakistan now. I think it will take a while to eliminate all the terrorists if the same procedure continue.
9068	As every one know Pakistan played a vital role to bring out all of these terrorists. Hopefully the same government in power before is trying to close those gaps between the two nations. Terrorists are afraid that once they loose their jobs then they might start attacking us. The same procedures which are done now will take a while to exterminate terrorists from our land.
9069	Pakistan as a country is actively involved in the support of terrorism. This was started by the previous government who created this gap in the existing friendship between the nations. Now the current government is trying to bridge that gap and is trying to bring the two nations closer, but the terrorist groups fear they might loose their jobs, so they are now turning against Pakistan. I believe it will take time to eliminate the terrorists if this procedure continues.
9070	No. Cops need permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger. No, any reasonable person could not think that a 14 year-old could have authority to consent.
9071	Well yeah, if you have permission, you can. However, if you don't, this is something the police cannot do and most likely will not do. I am not sure if you have read up on how state and federal law is, and how people are so accustomed to not knowing how laws work. The boy could have been confused and just lied to the cops, but to think he's so innocent...
9072	It is troubling how many people are saying that your brother would let the police in without a warrant or a reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger. How could any reasonable person think that a 14 year-old, clearly not an adult, could have authority to consent?
9073	No. The police do not have to ask for the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or a reasonable suspicion that a person's life was in danger. ------- You have misunderstood this question.
9074	No. Cops need the permission of the owner of the house to search it without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that someone's life was in danger.  ADDENDUM: I would use my mother in law as a possible justification for my view, I would let an elderly lady in my house. She is not the owner of the house. She is a member of the family and a peaceful person. She would not likely raise any suspicion that my family was dangerous.
9075	The truth is that there is no one man one vote and there hasn't been since the beginning. It's just more obvious now that our government is really about one dollar one vote. Such is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves.. that's the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a front.

9077	It is interesting to note that the United States government has no actual power, which explains why it even exists. Therefore, we must be aware of who our government is. The United States government is a front that calls itself a Republic, but it really is not. Our government is ruled by the elite people of the world. Remember, the United States will never accept most foreigners as citizens, and that means you won't be able to vote. Such is the way of a republic. So save up your money and become one of the haves.. that's the only way to win. Our government has no power. It's a front.
9078	Fact is the government does not have any real power. It is just a front for oligarchs. So save up your money and become one of the haves, that's the only way to win. Our government has no power, it's a front for our oligarchs.

9080	Is it legal to accept court orders into his statement or not? He has no legal right to say you burned it when you knew he didn't have it. You can't give him a subpeona without it being both signed by him and his spouse. To make an analogical comparison, a lawsuit is a claim on which there is a lot of detail, and courts give detailed instructions on how to find witnesses to support the claim, and how they could not find witnesses and rely on statements of witnesses. A subpeonas for redemption of property is basically a face value proof that he was told about the defective piece of property. Nothing further specific can be said.   The fact is, that person can deny that he was served because you have no real authority to give subpeonas. He can say you burned it and he never got it (no signatures that he himself received anything), and you could be in deep water for that court offense, including possible jail. So, yes he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
9081	He accepted it in his stance? This isn't like a prize or a package that you can accept on someone's behalf. A subpena is a very important document sent by the courts, with the specific destination being to the person in question, not the person's dog or girlfriend or stupid coworkers. By accepting the stupid slip, you made it easy for the court to nonchalantly say he "served" the document to the destination person, when in fact it was not.  To make an analogical comparison, would you have accepted someone's document if it were a lawsuit. Do you always want to jump to conclusions? Are you that nosy for someone?

So, yes he has a decent right to be pissed at you. I would.
9082	To put an analogy for this document, it is like a lawsuit. In court, you never give subpeonas, and you can refuse to serve someone if you are not authorized to do so. In other words, you cannot be "ought to have servers to the intended person", but it is possible that the intended person denies he ever received the subpeono.  To give an analogy for this, it is like when someone threatens you, and you save yourself from physical harm. You may think: "At least he did warn me, so he doesn't really mean it", but in real life, you don't do it, because there can be consequences.
9083	This isn't like a prize or a package from UPS that you can accept on someone's behalf.

9084	That's why you should refuse anything sent from the courts. This isn't like a UPS package that you can accept on someone's behalf.

9085	Because Jr. doesn’t realize (despite having been told and having pledged twice) that his job is to protect and defend the constitution of the United States.  He thinks his job is to do a variety of other things.  If you watch him speak for long enough, he will tell you what he thinks his job is, usually something along the lines of "to lead" or "to tell people what I am thinking" or "to unite Americans behind my common cause" or some other rubbish - never to protect and defend the constitution.  So to answer your question, Jr. thinks it is his job to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he truly honestly has no idea what his job really is.

9090	All would be happy to ban something; they could use it to get votes, and it would feel good to get some control over things. A guy could probably get a law passed requiring a condom in mattresses... imagine that...
9091	Suppose that the proponents of this change intend to balance out liability and costs, in addition to meeting the intent of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law that has this intent. It meets the intent of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, and if the state decides they want towns to play nice — that can’t be a bad thing.  The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if lots of people start suing the towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town. But that’s a matter of writing the law intelligently and not allowing such legal loopholes.
9092	I think if state legislatures decided that it would be reasonable to claim the rights gained from population density, then they could pass a law like this. It meets the intent of the 5th Amendment Takings Clause, and it is the natural evolution of the zoning code. The only potential downside is that if lot and land owners start suing the towns and counties -- that can't be a bad thing.
9093	Assuming a valuation of something can be reasonable calculated, then I would have no problem with a legislature passing a law like this.

9095	I'm not supporting abortion. I think it is wrong. However, a woman should be free to make her own decision, not required to do so as is. I think abortion is the number one cause of sexually transmitted diseases in our society. I'm not sure of the rates of incest but I think a lot of women who commit incest in their own families either do so because they are in a biological alliance to them or they think they can protect their kids without some logic. A lot of the gay couples who are out there are in fact parents. It's a little easier for some of the gay couples to have children outside of that relationship because it legitimizes a lot of this crap.
9096	Not in my opinion. I consider myself pro-choice. I would never look down on or criticize someone who has had an abortion but I know that in my heart it's wrong and not an option for me. But I would much rather have these women who have their mind set on doing it go to a clean sterile facility and not some rusty shack and but their lives at risk as well. These women are mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts etc. I think every one knows it's not morally right they aren't motivated to have an abortion bc its morally right I think they choose to because of situational factors. N I think most women feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed and wrong about their option but they felt that was their only way out
9097	it doesn't matter. None of us can live up to the standards that some people demand of us. There will always be some entitled morons who will not understand why anyone would want to be forced to live up to their standards. But we are who we are and we can't turn away from a simple truth of our own inherent worth. We should love ourselves for who we are or who we have become regardless of how many people yeh like or don't like who we are. And I think it's unnatural for some people to expect others to always be perfect. We should all be happy with ourselves, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself, especially if you're loving yourself despite that you're not perfect. If others disapprove of your choices, don't listen, but don't take it personally. Everyone has their own opinion and they are entitled to their own. Some people hate u and it has nothing to do with you, it's about them. And they should respect your right to be unpopular, because what most people want isn't always the best for the world. I don't want to be forced to conform to a worldview that's not mine. I don't want to be forced into thinking about whether or not a random guy likes me because I don't want to think about all the intrusive stuff that's totally unnecessary, but hey, life's too short, can't it?

9100	In any event, you should be asking your lawyer.  It's his job to help you understand the consequences of accepting any settlement offer.  Write down all your questions, and then meet with your lawyer and ask him. I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering.  Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him.  So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the attorney to pay his fee.

9102	It is unclear how this settlement deals with your medical expenses.  It sounds like it will only cover the amount you suffered while pregnant; in other words, $20,000.  I imagine that a lot of people share your pain and suffering, including your baby's doctor, nurses, and the father.  As for what the remainder will go to, the lawyer will tell you that, after his fee is paid, the remainder will go to you and your family.  
9103	In any event, your post is a little unclear. In fact, these are really questions you should be asking your lawyer.

9105	Get real.  "Allow" connotes freedom, which is all a government should give you.  And that same "allow" allows anyone to make whatever they want out of themselves, purchase whatever they want.  You'd have a gripe if you could phrase the question "How can the US FORBID people from buying food or health insurance" but you can't.
9106	Because it would be thoroughly unfair to force people to pay for things they can't afford. Let them buy what they want.  We as Americans are supposed to be free to buy anything, even unhealthy things. If the government doesn't want to buy it, get rich and buy it yourself and burn your notes.
9107	What the heck does a "forbidden" entail?  Who decided the list of things a government must or must not do?

9110	Sounds like you need a different attorney, and a bail bond agent. First of all, this is enough to bring charges against the attorney, the notary, your mother, and YOU. Put all these together and the crime begins with conspiracy! This violates most state notary laws, attorney responsibility rules, not to mention fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes. If I were you, I would take cover.

Put all this together and the crime begins with CONSPIRACY!  This violates most state notary laws, attorney responsiblity rules, and fraud, forgery, and fraudulent schemes. If you want to correct this situation I would certainly be the first one to speak to the authorities about this. Deeds must be recorded by the state so finding out about this is easy. The "real" inheritor won't have to look too hard to find out what has happened. If I were you I would take cover.
9113	The text is quite confusing. You are basically saying that your mother is a fraud and by doing this deed, she is making you her son. So you need to call the police and inform them of your mother's fraud. As for bail, I would at the very least use a consulting or commercial lawyer who deals in this kind of law. They can give you an opinion of what you are doing is legal or not. I would also use a bail bondsman. Anything they can give you or give you suggestions for you to hire will definitely help you in your case.

9115	Your "question" is both illogical and incoherent. Let's start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary. Before you call somebody unethical you damn well better have a factual basis for doing so. You have nothing. I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed signed "for her own personal gain." I take it your regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then what the hell are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
9116	Your "question" is both incoherent and contains mainly opinions stated as facts. Let\'s start by pointing out that it is standard practice for an attorney to be a notary.

I notice you make much of your mother having the quitclaim deed singed "for her own personal gain." I take it your regard people who do things for personal gain as scum. Well then kid just what the hell are you doing this for? For YOUR personal gain? Guess what that makes you?
9117	That "your mother" deed signing your mother's signature for her personal gain is NOT her decision. She actually signed it by mistake. It's common business practice to use one own personal name to sign property owned by another for their personal benefit. She's human, not a grammarian and signed by mistake. So what? The document is signed so why argue? Have your mom as the legal owner and let her take her personal gain. End of story.

9119	Since your question is asking if they could not have just signed it and not asked for one in the first place, I will have to answer that they could have. If it was legal to have them do so, then it's also legal to ask them to do so.
9120	Of course they would if they get in a position that they don't want a child.  When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will try to say something like "Oh I'm not like to other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion".  It's usually okay for them, but their anti-abortion when it's someone else.
9121	There are some women that get raped and they shouldn't give up their children because it's their choices and they're the ones to make them. but there are also those that get pregnant but then lie and say that it's the pregnancy that caused them to lie but I don't see how they are more right than those people that have abortions. We are the ones to make our choices.
9122	Well obviously having an abortion when someone else is involved is an ethical decision.
9123	Of course they would give an abortion if they got in a position where they didn't want a child. When a lot of those pro-lifers do get in that situation they will say something like "Oh I'm not like the other females, because this or that happen, so this is why I'm having an abortion".

9124	Of course they would have abortion if they didn't want a child.

It's usually okay for them, but their anti abortion when it's someone else.
9125	There are current laws on our books that would allow the government to fine this illegal alien $250,000. This gives him a lesson and his children don't need to go through the pain of being illegal aliens. This also shows the illegal aliens that they don't need to try and get our jobs.
9126	If people disobey the laws on our books such as not hiring illegal aliens or not letting employers employ undocumented workers, they will be locked up for years. It's just not right.
9127	Those laws that are current on the books are wrong and should be changed because illegal immigrants and employers are putting their lives at risk because they know there are such laws but they still disregard them. I think our govt should fine those illegal aliens as well as employers that hire them and put their lives at risk. Also, our govt should change the laws so that illegals and employers would not be putting their lives at risk.
9128	If we were to disobey our laws like these people are, we would be locked up for years. It's just not right.
9129	There are several laws on our books that would allow our govt to fine them both $250,000, plus incarceration, and deportation. Also, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring illegal aliens. So they should follow these laws.
9130	This would depend upon whether the person was sent to a professional in the field under which the person was being evaluated. In some cases the judge can send a person for reevaluation if he or she determines the person who gave the evaluation was biased toward the person being evaluated. But, no, a person can not be reevaluated simply to satisfy the whims of a judge. Or anyone else.
9131	That's really vague language. How is a judge "biased" against someone? How is a judge more conservative? How is a judge more liberal? What? I think the key to this article, and the majority of it, is that the development of certain text is important and important enough that it should NOT change because a judge is more conservative or more liberal.

9135	Since this is a family member, you have to work things out.  Confront them privately and tell them to stop it.  Threaten to tell the whole family if they do not repay what they took-not just from you but your entire family.  Do not fall for sob stories.  The time for sob stories was before she took the money.  What did she need the money for?  Gambling, drugs, etc? Then demand that she gets counciling.  If it was for a valid reason, then you need to be firm but fair.  This is not how people behave; especially towards family.  Avoid getting the police involved if possible.  This will only lead to being on Dr. Phil. Change the locks and explain she is no longer welcome in your house.

9140	Walking and cycling to work are free and open to everyone and nobody has to have a special exemption from work to do it. There is a massive environmental benefit to using motor vehicles as people. Most workplaces are too far from home or school, and there's the possibility of an accident on the way or you could get into a traffic jam which delays you and the longer you take to get home means you will eat your lunch on the way and your commute adds an extra expense to your bills.
9141	Marijuana smoking should be legalised everywhere. It is a simple natural herb which provides pleasure and relaxation, and has many beneficial medicinal properties. It relieves stress, reduces pain, and certain studies show that it can disipate asthma, and be beneficial to Alzheimer's patients. The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.

9143	Why restrict the use of hemp when its mostly used in the production of clothing and construction material, which means we are only limiting the development of hemp seeds to make it more profitable to oil companies. As long as there are companies making profits from cannabinoid research, then there would be more money to fund this research than if we legalised marijuana. The legalisation of medical cannabis can only take place once it has been shown that there are medicinal benefits.

9145	We should not split the church and state because it doesn't say anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches bible that's one thing but I can't understand why a pastor can speak from his pulpit and there is no restriction? For example, Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political view's, and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit. He should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
9146	Separation of Church and State doesn't say anything about whether a minister can teach Bible. If a minister teaches Bible, that's one thing, but pastor's like Rod Parsley, who for many years has flaunted his political views and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
9147	It is illegal for any elected officials (State Senator, Representative or President) to endorse any candidate.
9148	While I support a separation of church and state and the tax exempt status for ministers, the man who preaches that this does not apply to big government and the preference for one party over another should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
9149	Doesn't say anything about being tax free. If a minister teaches bible, that's one thing, but if a pastor as Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political view's, and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
9150	You are correct, the federal government has no authority over clothing, but the state and local governments have them. However, these laws are primarily set up to hide the fact that they are actually about sexual mores and that they have nothing to do with  dressing and that we should be realistic in how different we dress.
9151	The federal government does not have the delegated power to make laws concerning clothing except in those geographical areas under direct federal control. States and localities have power to make such laws within their jurisdictions. By and large such laws reflect local perceptions of decency and civility. During the last 30 or so years the existence of such laws and the application of such laws have significantly loosened. For example, most people no longer formally dress to go to church or to dine out. Society has come to respect those who wish to dress differently. For those who do dress differently, they should be realistic in their degree of difference by not anticipating a warm acceptance of some style and this is particularly true when dress reflects sexual mores.

Society has come to respect those who wish to dress differently.

For example, if a person is wearing a costume it is reasonable for the person to expect that it will be acceptable.

9154	There's no such thing as politically correct laws.  There is where decent, even charitable people argue in good faith that some certain actions or styles are offensive to others and they try to get rid of those laws and those types of styles. For example, we argue in good faith that mistresses would be a fairer way of setting forth the legal definition of a wife. Many Americans argue in good faith that pornography in the movies should be banned. I don't agree with one person's good faith and the other person's, but their arguments have become somewhat acceptable and some political correct people actually choose to ban what we can choose to not ban even though we have to feel bad sometimes and thank God for the internet because people are talking about everything.  For example, see about Tom Lea's views of and comments on chemical fertilizers. Also, check out quotes on obvious ways that physics is considered offensive to some people.
9155	The people who fight for the crown have no right to pillage our country for the richest family on earth.
9156	I don't know but as an American, I find it hilarious that the UK keeps putting so much money into that royal family thing. Granted, I wouldn't be so amused it I were British, but since I wasn't-   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA-  I realize that over there they don't have such privileges so naturally I'm going to have to oppose it. I'm glad my tax dollars don't go to expensive sports cars, drinking binges, designer clothes, torrid love affairs, expensive castles and God knows what else...
9157	Hopefully Bush will leave some dirt behind him after he leaves office.
9158	Does a god only bind people who are good. I would assume so, and he is fair and I do not doubt it. I don't know about the other rules, but it seems the angels are doing an all to good job of supervising them. I am sure that the damned would love nothing more than to look back on this and find out that they could have been so much better, and won't get to do that. It is somewhat comforting to know that the devil can't touch us. Thus there will be no prayers to him, will there? I'll never understand how they dont think the angels are doing a good job now at the moment. I thought it was different, and they didn't treat us like slaves. In fact, it seems they did something bad, because there must be people in hell. Perhaps they are doing a wonderful job now, and torturing us even more!
9159	Despite all the so called "Lady Di scandals", no decision could shake my confidence and trust in the British Royal Family. I find it very funny how the British scorn the idea that I pay taxes for that criminal family. Maybe we should help the rest of the world with some anti-racism funds so that when they finally are forced to privatize the British Royal Family, I won't have to wait until the next Royal spending scandal. Oh yeah, I know what to name my daughter: Princess Dishonor. HAHAHAHA. glad my tax dollars don't go to ski trips, drinking binges, designer clothes, torrid love affairs, expensive cars and castles and God only knows what else...
9160	There are some people who have cash in their freezers, and they are suspicious but they are not necessarily unlawful.
9161	An obvious but guilty crime is sufficient to warrant removal.
9162	Out of place and not commensurate with the place unless you're aware that this is one of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States. The way money goes around is more questionable than my last name.
9163	Once we have some charges that have been made against these people it will be possible to remove them from office, absent a supermajority vote in the House.  Interpersonal relationships are sometimes fun and lots of emotions get involved.  But that doesn’t mean that they are wrong. It means that they are not necessarily in our best interest.
9164	It is suspicious that a judge with millions of dollars in the freezer has some funds he keeps to invest himself. The overwhelming majority of the public should expect that a judge of the Supreme Court will have some extra money in the freezer.
9165	When we take a life for any reason, including suicide, it is always to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal, in reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?--It really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our societies judicial system. Do you care about someone else's life or do you think only of yourself? So, are you a murderer or murderer of the law or the murderer of human rights? What does it take to make you care about another human being? And what more should we do to help alleviate the suffering of those in our society?----I'm glad you think so.---If you had free choice for the options that are available to you, how would you plan to live it out?----Later, I stopped to think, how do we figure out who is going to make us a martyr? It seems that our society has never been that kind of
9166	Death penalty is a cruel and terrible way to deal with anyone. This also solves the problem of a reluctant or reluctant jury; however, the death penalty simply doesn't work. We should keep better records, work harder to rehabilitate the guilty rather than askin' for mercy, and make arrangements with other countries to keep the prisoners from being innocent.
9167	There isn't a difference for the legal system between killing someone in the state of Texas and killing someone in New York or Ohio or Pennsylvania or Florida or California, Washington or Illinois or Oregon or Colorado or Maine or Vermont. In reality we are no better off than the killers themselves if we have to resort to dealing death in retribution. Think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?---It really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our societies judicial system.---It says: "You kill someone in the state of Texas, we will kill you back" is we have to resort to dealing death in retribution.
9168	In point of view, people who oppose the death penalty don't really make a difference if the murderer receives his last meal. In fact, they are no better off than the murderer himself if we have to resort to killing people in order to avenge ourselves. Think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising the usage more? It's really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our societies judicial system.---"You kill someone in the state of Texas, we'll kill you back" Ron White--
9169	It is only to assuage our own guilt that they are given a last meal in the legal system. What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more? It really makes you wonder about the cruelty and the overall lack of compassion in our societies judicial system. Are we better off, as a society, if we deal death in retribution? Think about this, how is killing different for the legal system? What are the alternatives to the death penalty? Why are we not using and advertising their usage more?--We should have a system for punishment where the individual is held accountable and not every murderer is thrown into a maximum security prison and pushed to suicide or to murder someone else. The people who have been in these prisons should be paid restitution for what they have caused.--The murder of a single person is terrible, but what about the number of people who are killed by the ones who create these laws.
9170	The fruits of theology are rotten and few.  The few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought.  Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas.  Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims.  It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition (according to the principle of parsimony).  Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.

9173	In point of view, the fruits of theology are rotten and few, even though they are inspired by theology. The reason for this is that theology is of the fourth rate philosophy, as it only relies on its initial assumption of a specific conception of God and scriptural claims. Therefore, it is less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy. One should do that by learning cultural studies, history, anthropology, and comparative religion.

9175	Though I don't believe that we will be able to decide when this simulatron will close, the good news is that we will be able to live in it for our entire lives. We'll be able to have an artificial simulation of life in the real world for the rest of our lives.
9176	In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiences, so be it.
9177	It would not be worth it in the long run to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end.  I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy lfe, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.

9180	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
9181	Being homosexual is not immoral if its done in self defence. 
9182	Homosexuality is immoral and inherently wrong, based on logic.
9183	Although I do believe in God, I do not believe that everything in the bible is true and thus biblical scripture does not convince me. Additionally, if something is wrong their should be observable reasons in reality.
9184	there should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
9185	On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in your bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep them by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.

9190	Companies shouldn't give discounts to retired military personnel because of their dedication to their careers but only to the extent that they are deserving of the award.
9191	Some businesses provide discounts to the elderly and the armed forces. For instance, at restaurants the discount can be to the full amount, while at the movies it can be a 50% discount.  Does this sound fair? Armed forces, who receive discounts from manufacturers for their military equipment, are also eligible for discounts on goods and services from non-military businesses. I don't know if this is fair to be receiving tax benefits not only from the government but also from businesses. The government should not be paying for medicare and social security benefits for veterans as well as the taxpayers.  I think that there should be a set age limit of when one is eligible for and getting social security, medicare, and a hefty retirement fund.
9192	 I don't agree with the fact that businesses should (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.  Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?  Is it just as a way to say thanks?  Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.  Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.  There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  What about farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?  They keep us healthy.  Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.
9193	Discounts for seniors are so unfair because seniors contribute financially for their social security taxes and medicaid.  I'd rather these individuals not be talking about these things because they won't get a discount. Instead, I believe seniors should be getting more benefits for taking care of seniors, these benefits don't take the form of special discounts. Because I do believe that more should be giving to senior citizens.  What's more important is getting the benefits for doing these professional work, they should be getting more benefits for these professionals than getting discounts, like discounts for students. Also, for those saying military should get tax free goods because they're of higher value.  I'd like to address that statement because they are better than seniors.  They're a generation that is serving, good soldiers who put their own lives on the line protecting their communities with their service, and their worth doesn't stop at free beer and a tax free beer cup. 
9194	Single part: businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.  Single part: There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  Single part: Farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?

9195	Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts in 2012, and ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars, and wealth Russians used other countries to skirt around Russian taxes. Now the US, the EU, and several other countries are taking legal action to sanction these countries and their people, and European countries are buying much needed gas, and in turn, Russia is buying things from other countries. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more in the long run, but it will help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas businesses and don't use tax havens. They will be frozen or black listed by the US and EU.
9196	It's strange to think that Putin ordered his government officials to close offshore accounts, buy Russian made cars and use other countries to skirt Russian taxes. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will be sanctioned or frozen. Something of Putin's cabinet is going to talk about this move. Because this is his move, he is the one ultimately responsible. It may be a hit to European business and other nations that buy the products Russian companies and industries sell, but it is also a strong blow to the corrupt hold that Putin holds on their hearts.    Russia may use this to reign in his corrupt officials, but it will hurt Russians and their businesses more than it will benefit Europeans.     This is just my opinion, or view. I'd like to hear others. Thanks.
9197	Putin ordered his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people. Europe buys from Russia much needed gas and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem. So I believe, not only will this hurt Europe more so in the long run, but help Russia. Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skating billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen.  
9198	Putin ordered his government officials to close offshore accounts and he ordered all government officials to buy Russian cars and wealthy Russians use other countries to hide their wealth.

Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen.
9199	 Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts and ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars and wealthy Russians use other countries to skirt around Russian taxes.

Because Putin may use this to reign in his corrupt officials and tax skimming billionaires. Don't rely on overseas business and don't use tax havens, because they will get sanctioned or frozen.
9200	Everybody can watch ESPN. Yet this country still seems to have more internal problems than any other in the world. I believe we should focus on more problems than just football. Why not try to keep up with our internal issues and get them figured out so we don't end up like places like Israel and the middle east? I believe there's more to life than FSU football and drunken infant deaths.
9201	It's okay to hide your personal thoughts and beliefs from everyone, but unfortunately, extremes are harder to hide. These extremists gain a lot of attention for their beliefs and act too. So, if we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over our nation, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things. So, change my view.

9203	It's good to learn more about Extremism, and to be aware of how it could impact us. However, I believe it's equally important to study our own ignorance and ignorance that leads to incidents of hate and hate that results in wars and violent acts against one another. We should take a step back from ourselves, and look at our ignorance and seek help, but also learn from others to help ourselves.

9205	My dad is 28 years older than my mom, and who he met when she was 17. I have a half brother older than my mom as well. A friend from my high school and I got into an argument when a 34 year old teacher from our high school was sexting a student (she was sexting back). I failed to see the big deal seeing as there were bigger problems in the world and I grew up with a belief that age did not matter when intimacy was involved. Not only was she pissed off when I expressed this belief but all the other girls in the group text. Why am I wrong?

9207	Parents, teachers, and other celebrities should be ashamed of themselves for discouraging older people from engaging in sexual behavior. The problem does not lie in age. Instead, the problem lies with immoral adults and the resulting immoral children.

9210	Recent reports in the business and science press that many well-known and influential business people and economists have attended conferences at George Mitchell's oil money-funded event that have discussed the "Limits to Growth" study, which is a critical analysis of the economic system, is shocking.
9211	I'm reading George Mitchell's "Limits to Growth" and I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.  Today, I don't hear our leaders in business, media, or heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism. At best, I hear people talking about solving inequality and climate change through innovations in technology and a sound understanding of economics. All of these solutions are well within the framework of globalized capitalism.
9212	We've learned that the "Limits to Growth" study written in 1972 is outdated and misguided, and subsequent popular books by E.F. Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others, were talking about the problems and limits to capitalism and consumer society. I recently learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, holds a series of conferences in Houston, Tex, focused on the "Limits to Growth" study. I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.  Today, I don't hear our leaders in business, media, or heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism. At best, I hear people talking about solving inequality and climate change through innovations in technology and a sound understanding of economics.

All of these solutions are well within the framework of globalized capitalism. Our leaders today are much less open-minded about possible solutions to global problems.
9214	The invention of fracking, the dramatic rise of drilling technology, and the unbridled abundance of cheap oil and natural gas are the direct result of the post-war growth in capitalism. It has allowed a "make it and sell it" economic system to flourish, leading to vast wealth for so many powerful people. Our leaders today are much less open-minded about possible solutions to global problems.
9215	This should be the standard type of container. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt. CMV.
9216	First off, I understand that sour cream is already available in a squeezable container. My view is that this should be the standard type of container. It is usually sold in a cup type of container with a lid, similar to yogurt. Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easier to scoop with a spoon. But a large majority of the time, it is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm. CMV.

It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt.  I understand that a squeeze can be conveniently applied with the push of a finger. However, many people in this country think it *is* worse to *use* a squeeze *than* to *apply* a spoonful with the palm of your hand. From this perspective, the type of container is more important than the technology.

Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more convenient to have a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. I think that some consumers should be able to choose the type of container as they wish.
9220	Teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely. I think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use. Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars. My view has changed.
9221	By raising the driving age teens will have more time to understand how to drive and be more responsible. By lowering the driving age, teens will have an easier time getting distracted by texting or using their cellphones while driving.

Car accidents happen all too often and keeping kids off the road will make things safer for them and for the adults that need to use cars. Change my view.
9223	My opinion is that age should not be a factor when it comes to driving.   Driving is a skill that requires much practice to perfect, and the transition to driving allows teens the opportunity to better understand and appreciate how vehicles work.   The age limit encourages teens to focus more on going to college and the development of a career, rather than developing driving skills and learning how to drive.   Teens without the protective belt are at greater risk for car accidents; raising the age to 21 will hopefully help reduce the number of fatalities by discouraging teenagers from being careless on the road.
9224	I believe that the current driving age, 16, is too low and that teenagers at that age are a danger on the road. Teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.

9225	Title is fairly self explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, People with God kill people" has led me to write this CMV. I am not a religious person, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV. I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God kill people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people *without* God kill people". I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own. I feel changing my view.

9230	If you make money from a job that you are not happy at, it may be better than an unprofitable job if you have the ability to enjoy your time off. For example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would rather that over a job where I make 60-70k a year and enjoy the 8 hour day. I feel this way because in my opinion, if you made good money with a job that (for you) has low job satisfaction, the time you have off will be even better because you have the money to be able to afford and do whatever you wanted, versus being happier with your job but not having the things you want in life. I feel I'm at a serious turning point in my life, and I want to make sure I look at all angles of opportunities presented to me. Please CMV!
9231	I'm not sure why but I have a serious turning point and I want to make sure I look at all angles. {My points of view are not absolute yes or no thoughts because I don't think an argument is right or wrong. I just feel like my points of view are right or wrong. I love food more than I love cats for example, and honestly I am more concerned with food than I am with cats. I also respect people better than I respect children for example, so my points of view are going to look different but I feel there is merit in them.
9232	I'm not sure why. But I completely feel that if you made plenty of money doing the shittiest job on earth, you should be content.  For example, if I made 100k a year from a job that I am not necessarily content with, I would prefer that over a job where I make 60-70k a year and enjoyed the 8 hour day.

9233	 I disagree with the notion of people having it much better if they make more money than you at a lesser paying job, unless it is paid well (ex: if you had a 20 hour working week but earn the equivalent of 40 - but it's paid well).

9235	Recently I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag MP3's. But I am willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he'll fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at say 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He has mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks. That being said, I still don't like MP3s, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold CD's (Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab etc.) or LP's. But my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of MP3's into my fancy vehicle audio system.
9236	What is the most accurate way to test the quality of a music file? Provide a very good signal source. If you can reproduce all the songs you like on that source at high resolution in a properly insulated environment that's fine with me. If you can't (i.e. cd player, magneto player, speakers without proper shock mounts etc.) then the best way is the familiar QC test (unless the track you are interested in specifically is compiled from stereo inputs that are at a fixed mixing level). This leaves you with the music room itself. Certainly a lot of hardware here can affect the listening experience. Just ask Kirkman if you don't believe me. Make sure that there is no moisture or humidity in the room. You can rarely overdo it with vacuum this time of year anyway.

9240	I'm not sure if I'd say that for the first time but we see all the time multiple cases of corruption, bankruptcy all over the world, and a country failing to maintain a positive economy.

9245	Though the social media campaigns and recent feminist acts are taking away from the real cause of the death of these women: feminist ideology.
9246	I'd like to commend everyone on their ability to talk about differing view points and opinions instead of just arguing.
9247	Yes, feminism is important and there are some challenges women face daily but taking a shooting that happened due to someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. Also, I see the misogyny as part of mental health issues, so if you can understand that, you won't need to do this.
9248	This gun would not have been out there had there been laws for mental health care.
9249	Concerning the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen), which may have come about because of the shootings and the media coverage, taking a shooting that occurred because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem of a sexist environment. This could be argued to either be a feminist problem (in which case there is a feminist solution) or a sexist problem (in which case there is a sexist solution). I'm all for feminism, do recognize that women face daily challenges men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem of a sexist environment.

9250	After watching the news recently, it really seems that the cracks in the EU are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some members states are watching the elections really has me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

9255	Here's why I don't trust their god: He never had a jealous temper. For all I know, He never even bothered looking up from sewing mere mortals. There's no track record of the Balima Elu's chasing down anyone who did something without His permission...
9256	Why did the true gods of today's religions not make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping false gods. Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting up there seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed that we strayed and worshiped false idols?
9257	The true God doesn't exist. If he really existed, he would make himself known to early people who lived in the Mesopotamian region before the Jesus freaking Christ even had a chance to be born. That's logical. And the other religions claim that each of the early gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off about us straying and worshiping false idols? I mean. If he really exists, that would support my argument. Why didn't the true gods of today's religions see fit to make themselves known to early people from the Mesopotamian region? Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped aren't sitting "up there" seriously ticked off about us straying and worshiping false idols? Why would the true, jealous God of Jesus Christ let us wander away for so long and worship false idols?
9258	We're confusing truth to all of this....the term truth being something that cannot be shown to be true but that must be accepted as such. We say that there is one true God but mean well or truly when we say that, well God there is. Yes, there can be many more true gods. We do not know the true nature of one of these other false gods. Perhaps he is jealous, we don't know that. But I don't know what good we have finding a true one or even a false one. It may be that even the false ones are just good at what they do, which is their point in being made. Which of course implies that just as there can be one true god but many false gods, so the false gods can be good at their kinds of things too. Which has the implication of saying that there are some things that are good that were made by one God and by others but that there are some bad things that were made by one God and by others. Does not mean that it was so that the one God could only do good and that the others were evil, but that it could be so that when one did the right thing and the others did the wrong, the good could keep doing the right thing while the others kept doing the wrong thing. Is this what we're saying? Don't say this another name for, are we just different ways of seeing and understanding same thing?
9259	How can we be sure that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't seriously ticked off because we strayed and worshiped false idols?

9270	There is strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age. However, not all countries where such behavior is not regarded as a violation of morality allows young adults to be drunk on the street. Therefore, the drinking age should be capped to 18, 19 or 21. If there are cases of adult male hit and run accidents, it should be up to 18 or 21 to drink alcohol.
9271	The drinking age should be 16. There is very strong anecdotal evidence from societies where casual drinking is socially acceptable from an early age. In these countries, such as France, there is a significantly lower rate of drinking-related diseases and deaths. If casual drinking is integrated into a society, it can seriously curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19, and 21. Furthermore, these extra years of alcohol sales can increase tax revenue and fund programs that help those afflicted with alcoholism to recover.
9272	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection.

9275	Excite is another colour. I never really liked this colour, since when I was little it reminded me of the colour of blood/murder - but as I got older, I started to appreciate this colour more. Yellow just reminds me of the sun or something.. which makes me happy. But red comes to me as much more striking to look at and possibly, exciting. It is also the colour for fire trucks and letter boxes and.. and.. red lipstick and.. rosy cheeks.. and.. and.. -- COOOOOOOOOOKE! :D

He sees no wrong in what he is doing even though he is... a. Breaking the law. b. Aware he is breaking the law c. Proud of it.  Personally, I think that it is not all that hard to wait until you are 16, after all, if teens are sexually active at such a young age, it could cause such problems as teenage pregnancy, STDs and even permanent damage to their bodies. I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong. I'm not one that support no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is, is a different story.

I'm not one that support no sex before marriage, but sex before you even really know what it is, is a different story.
9284	Having sex before getting married is a mistake because it causes a lot of physical and mental problems.
9285	Adam had the freedom to do either good or evil. He chose evil. This caused him to damage his relationship with God, which in turn led to an evil world. Man still has the freedom to do what he wants to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof. But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ. Repent and trust in Him.

9289	Man has a freedom to do what he wants to do, but not what he should do. Adam had the choice to do either good or evil. He chose evil, and the result of his evil choice was to damage his relationship with God. Now man still has the choice to do whatever he wants to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel against God and do evil. Look around for proof. But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ. Repent and trust in Him.
9290	Humans are known as homo sapiens and are part of the animal kingdom. Therefore humans are animals. And how can a human be "above" an animal? What qualifies as above? Should there be some sort of intelligence limit that divides humans from being classified as animals? How does greater intelligence lift humans out of the animal category? Would an extremely bright dolphin no longer count as an animal? I must admit that humans are very different from the rest of the animal world, but I don't see how this elevates us in any way.

9295	This piece is a call to action in the UK to put a stop to the governments big brother program.

9300	In status quo, children are now experiencing the wrong meaning of Christmas because a recent survey shows that majority of children see Christmas as gift day or the day where you get anything you want from your parents, which should clearly not be the case in status quo the meaning for Christmas is supposed to be the birth of Jesus Christ and when Santa Clause is moved into the picture children and even adults see Santa Clause as the Christmas symbol and it is no longer seen as Jesus. This is like the birthday party, everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy/girl so it is clearly not right, that is the same thing that is happening in Status Quo
9301	Some children see christmas as a gift day and they are expecting presents like on their birthday. This should not be the case. The idea of christmas is supposed to be the birth of Jesus Christ, when Santa Claus is moved into the picture, children and even adults see Santa Claus as the Christmas symbol, and it is no longer seen as Jesus. This is like a birthday party, everyone gives attention to a different person instead of the birthday boy/girl. Therefore, this is not right. This should be re-interpreted as something else.

9304	Children now experience the wrong meaning of christmas because of a recent survey that shows that majority of children see christmas as a gift day. Their parents actually give them stuff that is a total waste because they do not deserve it and a total waste because they will not use any of it. Thus they have seen christmas as a gift day. The correct way is to see christmas as the day that Jesus Christ was born and to have only one symbol from that as part of the Christmas. Santa Clause is not part of the the Christmas symbol.
9305	Policies on drug abuse like these should not happen. They should be for others who are as or even more asthmatic than you and you have ignored them when they were less breathing difficult. If you do not know something, you should learn. Drugs are a double edged sword. At their worst, they can make you die instantly. But they can also make you feel better or help you become the best person you can be. As a parent, you should model positive things in your child. I would put extreme pressure on anyone who uses drugs for reasons other than competition. The whole idea behind drugs is that they work to make the user feel better. According to this thought, every drug should be illegal. However, it should still be legalized for reasons other than competition and then strictly for that reason.
9306	Probably not legalizing ailments over counter should be something that the government does not think about. When it comes to illegal drugs such as alcohol and marijuana which are normally freely bought and sold, people can sit there and be rude about it. But other things such as steroids and people wanting to be bigger, faster, stronger, and tougher than what they normally are, and more sturdy for sport, I think this should go.
9307	The government should prohibit performance enhancing drugs from nonprofesional athletes since they can cause health problems that could hamper their performance if allowed. Also, doing so will prevent the use of these drugs by other young kids to gain an edge on the competition. Doing so will also put pressure on the players to use safe supplements instead of performance enhancing drugs and other harmful supplements that may cause any number of health problems.
9308	Agreed that legalizing performance enhancing drugs is an obsurd thought. One of the reasons performance enhancing drugs are illegal is that they do harm the body. It is in the best interest of the government to protect the players health because they are too young to see the consequences. Besides, these athletes pose as role models too many young kids. Do you want kids walking around pretending to have high pitched voices and pretending they haveboobs? This will encourage the use of steroids for younger kids becuase their favorite athlete is on them. Not only will you see a rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs in proffesional players, but in nonproffesional players as well. If performance enhancing drugs were legalized, it would cause all athletes to start using regardless if they want to or not because they will feel that they need to take them just to be able to compete with the other athletes.

9311	An economic super power in Europe, advanced scientific and military projects, new shock wave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan. Japan was fighting in the jungles in smaller bands and their navy was stopped pretty quickly. Loyalty to emperor stopped the entire country surrendering a couple of years earlier. Germany on the other hand were one of the world big boys, new military tactics and equipment, new scientific advancements, a economic power world wide (before the war). No contest. Nazi Germany wins.
9312	In the last few years, Germany had become an economic super power in Europe. Advanced scientific and military projects, new shockwave military tactics, and far more powerful than Japan. Japan was fighting in jungles in smaller bands and their navy was stopped pretty quickly. Only their loyalty to emperor stopped the entire country surrendering a couple of years earlier. Germany on the other hand were one of the world big boys, new military tactics and equipment, new scientific advancements, and a economic power world wide (before the war). No contest. Nazi Germany wins.
9313	Japan was fighting in jungle-filled lands where it was surrounded by smaller bands by their enemies. Their navy was so inferior that it didn't return any of the boats that its men, spares, weapons and ammunition ran out of fuel. Thus, the Japanese and the rest of Asia continued to fight. However, the loyalty of Japan to the emperor stopped it from being totally defeated only two years earlier. Thus, the Japanese did the fighting while the rest of Asia did the crying.
9314	Germany was the world's economic superpower in Europe, a leader in advanced science and military technology, and a power the world over. Japan was fighting in jungle and was stopped pretty quickly by their emperor. Hitler's German Navy was a superior force, but it was Hitler's loyalty to his emperor that stopped his entire country from surrendering.
9315	Well, he is a very controversial issue. Much more touchy than most non-Quebecans would think... but the French nationalists aren't objecting to his performance based on artistic merit - where they would have a very good point - but on the basis of his nationality... when all he is really trying to do is just celebrate the history of an important place... Fran~kly, I think the best way to celebrate Quebec City's 'birthday' would be to build a humongous statue to the father of Canada, General Wolfe, on the plains of Abraham!

9320	I don't believe that Queen takes it, because their anthems will live on long after the band is forgotten. Also, their range of themes and ideas is a lot wider. Pearl Jam is good, musically, but Queen is better.
9321	Ohhh.... this is tough, very tough. These are two of my if not my two favorite bands. I think Queen takes it, though, because their anthems (We will Rock You, We are the Champions...) will live on long after the band is forgotten. Also, the range of themes and ideas their music explores is a lot wider. Pearl Jam is good, musically, but Queen is better.
9322	Yes, both bands have great compositions. Queen took it for good and life. However, Pearl Jam is more based on a mixture of excellent female and male songs as well as well known songs by Queen so I choose Pearl Jam
9323	OHHH this is a tough situation, very tough I think in the same league these two bands are, Queen takes it though because the ones (We Will Rock You, We are the Champions...) are anthem lyrically they will live on long after the band is forgotten. As well their range of themes and ideas they explore is much wider Pearl Jam is good as well musically but their song work is much better imo.

9325	It is important to choose where our taxes go, because it would let us prioritize what the government would be funding. For example, a family of four would choose the education section because education directly affects their family. If that family never got sick, they would select the health care section to finance things regarding their health. This would be more efficient in that the money would be prioritized for that specific area.
9326	The government can prioritize where taxes are spent more efficiently. For example, a family that never got sick can uncheck the health care category and check "education."
9327	By choosing where taxes are paid, the government can allocate the money in a way that is more efficient. It directs money where it is most needed by prioritizing where the fund is spent.
9328	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck health care. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.

9330	Ocarina of Time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and Majora's was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out above Majora's Mask. We're talking about the best game in the series, and we are mainly referring to what most people regard as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore and a captivating storyline. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. Brilliantly designed and executed, and still regarded as the best game in the series. All honors go to Ocarina of Time.

9335	I won't kill myself but in the event I suffer from early onset Alzheimer's or similar mental decline I would consider ending my life. At the point where I lose my grip on reality, forget who I am, forget what I am, forget what I believe, then I cease being me. I would consider ending my life in such case.
9336	At this point, I would consider putting an end to my life as if I was suffering from early onset Alzheimer's or a similar mental decline.

9340	average salary of an american is 32,000$ The average salary of a teacher (not including the monetary value of benefits) is 53,000$ In Wisconsin, the salary including benefits is 75,000$ 4.5 billion is spent on teacher salaries, and 1.6 billion is spent on their insane amount of benefits. I believe that this is a huge amount of money for someone to receive, especially since all mediocre teachers are practically impossible to fire. Teachers should be paid and given raises based on performance, not the amount of years they stayed at the school. I recommend watching the documentary 'waiting for superman', because it sheds light on the many imperfections of our failing public school system. The US should have close to the highest test scores, but because of our abundance of average teachers that cant be fired, we are not. Instead, the US has some of the lowest scores.

9343	In my opinion, the average teacher’s salary should be changed to $53,000 because the monetary value of their benefits is nearly $ 1 billion.

9345	Why do we still act as though Einstein's view of the universe is correct? It just sounds like someone is saying that they want you to believe it. Think about it... get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks. Literally! This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the "ultimate sagging mattress" that is often alluded to. Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it. 1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions. 2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes. 3. It can never work with quantum physics. 4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum? 5. Other theories are far more logical, but have been gunned down by conservative physicists.

9348	Why do we still act as though Einstein's theory of gravity is true? By "acting as though" I assume that we have not learned that our scientists believe in another theory of gravity that has not received mainstream acceptance yet. I do not assume that we do not know that they have a theory in progress in hopes that it will be accepted. But we all act as though. Indeed, it is so much easier to believe that black holes don't exist because those who do have only found two confirmed objects. Let's get one good black hole. Then everyone will realize that black holes don't exist!
9349	Most scientific theories are merely a way of controlling how we interpret the world around us. We need to stop focusing on logic rather than facts. We have to admit that there is a huge part of the universe that we still cannot explain. We can only act as though these phenomena do exist.
9350	The U.S. has one of the strongest navies in the World. We have a total of 366 military ships in commision as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous waters cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. There are hundreds of ships peacefully pass through these dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.

9352	The US has one of the strongest navies in the world. We have a total of 366 military ships in commission as we speak. We have a total of 4 military ships in the area that are in danger of pirate attacks. These dangerous water cover THOUSANDS of nautical miles. So can a mere 4 ships protect this huge expanse of sea? Not effectively. So why can't the most powerful navy in the world spare a few more ships to protect the trade routes and countries around this area? Or would we rather keep the 4 ships there and hope that no more ships get hijacked? I prefer the first option. I mean, hundreds of ships peacefully pass through the dangerous waters each day, some with the intentions to provide aid to third world countries. Is it truly politically correct to allow trade routes to be dangerous and hostile? Nope.
9353	Do you even need a reason to get rid of nukes? All they do is harm innocent people around the world. It's too late for action.
9354	It is wrong to keep the military ships there and hope no more ships get hijacked because hundreds of ships peacefully pass through this dangerous area each day some of them with the intentions to provide aid to the Third World. We should improve the security measures over there.
9355	There is no way to argue that Israel's interest is Americas interest because they are one in the same. Israel is an ally of America and its an America ally. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may use forces to use against Iran. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
9356	There is no right or wrong in this situation but I disagree. They say the neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for years now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope this does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seems inevitable.
9357	There are too many differences of opinion with this topic to try to modify the wrong one. I disagree that we will have war with Iran next year. It could happen, but it may take longer. We should let the Iranians do their best and wait. If the Arabs then decide they can't live under the same conditions as we can...we may have a war. People should realize that Israel's interests are the same as America's. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly, there is a good chance Israel could end up in a situation where it can get very dangerous. The neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now. Hopefully people can see how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
9358	When you get into the middle east, you will find that all three countries are under the thumb of the neoconservatives. There will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
9359	There is no disagree side; I disagree. I am not saying there is a good chance Iran and the USA will have an actual war. However, the neoconservatives have been planting the seeds for some time now and people have to realize how dangerous a group of people they are and how inaccurate they have been about their predictions. I hope it does not happen but there will be no fundamental change in our Middle Eastern foreign policy so war and conflict seem inevitable.
9360	We agreed that this was the best sushi of our lives. And I would follow up with saying: "And I've had a shit load of sushi" But seriously, don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. Worth the price of a rental car.
9361	I'm not sure that my husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi of our lives. It might be the best sushi he had ever had or it might be something he didn't like but this was definitely not the best sushi of his lives. And he would follow that up with also saying, "and I have had a shit load of sushi" Seriously, don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. Worth the price of a rental car

9364	Because the food was great, and so were the prices. And the best part was the fact that my husband and I agreed on this. And he would follow up with, "Yes, I've had a shit load of sushi." Seriously - don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. Worth the price of a rental car
9365	Owning a business on Craig Street, in the very middle of Times Square, and sometimes being forced to eat the food on this strip, yesterday was the day. The people were very rude and hardly made eye contact with me, and the actual food I received wasn't fit to feed my dog. Really, skip this place. Forget what I said. Don't skip, run for your life.
9366	Although the people of Suburbia seem to be rude, the food is fit to feed dogs. However, if I were forced to eat food on this strip, I would give up in disgust.
9367	Yesterday was the day. The people are so rude, they hardly made eye contact. The food I received wasn't fit to feed my dog. Seriously, skip this place. Forget what l said, don't skip, run for your life.
9368	I own a business off of Craig Street and I'm sometimes forced to eat the food on this strip. Yesterday was the day. The people are so rude, they hardly made eye contact.

9369	If you're on Craig Street it's rude to eat in that area. You should run for your life if that's a problem.
9370	So weird... I love to complain! So last week, I walked into a dim sum place and asked the waitress about an egg roll soup that was awesome. She said 'no sir that was just past and it will never be served here again...'... I asked if she meant the restaurant had closed. She said no sir that was just all the chef had left because when they closed it they served food until everything was gone, and this was just one of the good ones. I showed her that last night I said 'don't leave eggs in soups' and she said 'forget it this is not the closest Chinese place to me so it's very hard for me to keep these kinds of things up.' I said 'Ok, in that case. I'm not going to complain because it's my right.' We should be complaining about 'everything is tasteless' instead of 'only my favorite stuff is left when I say vegan.' It's stupid, but I have been where this place is: 'oh I'd like to try this stuff but I never have. This is what all the vegan food is like, and I've never had it.' Some foods are vegan and this is just not a good representation of it, or if it's not vegan it's supposed to taste like meat, which is fake. Not food that was vegan last year but is not anymore so it's not ever on the menu now that it's so much cheaper
9371	Food was good! And the vibe of this restaurant is awesome. The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa. She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu (!!!!!) and always making sure our drinks were filled up. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious.   This was an A+ experience. Very happy.
9372	Best dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off so it was vegan. SO. GOOD. The fresh basil was the highlight, pasta was perfect, and that alone makes it 5 stars.   The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa.

9373	More importantly, it's a great dining experience because the food is delicious, and the staff is helpful. Also, it's an amazing dining experience because we got to talk with our server Alyssa, who was helpful and attentive to us.
9374	While the food was super delicious here, our server Alyssa was absolutely fabulous.   She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu and always making sure our drinks were filled up.   I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious.   I do wish we had a better review of the meal though, but overall I had a really good experience here
9375	Slow service, too expensive, weird chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of sashimi which tasted OK but not worth the price tag. Also had a beef noodle dish which was very mediocre, small amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there, nothing extravagant. 2 wines and 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.

9377	Don't go there, the service is slow, the tables are awkward and the chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worth the price.

9379	If you want to try sushi, go here instead. The service is fast and there's a good selection of sushi options. The prices are not outrageous but expensive compared to other sushi restaurants.
9380	Jack in the Box has poor service and management. I've never had a bad experience with one.   The manager and the employees were rude.   They took much longer to deliver my food and didn't really bother helping me with my order when I was there.   I've brought food in before and said it should be right there by now and I'm just glad I got it even if I didn't have the best experience.   It shouldn't take as long to get food that is just sitting there.
9381	In most cases, local and small businesses offer better customer service. Jack in the Box is among the larger franchises, so it's not an unusual situation. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. Five guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk in burger place.
9382	The service here sucks, I've come here twice with this, being the last time I bothered, I've walked in both times. It took about 15 minutes to get a single jumbo jack last time. It wasn't busy. Today it took 3 minutes with me being the only person in line and two people looking right at me and not taking my order before I left. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. 5 guys will continue to get my business over you. They seem to take less time than you do and they're a walk in burger place.
9383	I'm not a fan of the Jack in the Box franchise. I've only eaten here twice and both were badly mistreated. I walked in to get a jumbo jack and it was one of the longest lines in the business. They didn't want to take my order. I had to start asking questions before they left my order. Management should consider an overhaul of their employees. 5 guys seem to stop by and get my business over 2 of your employees.  They're 5 times as slow at taking my order and their employees seem to smile more than the other employees that serve me. There should be a penalty for the slowest person, and it should not just be one meal.
9384	Jack in the box services are not bad, but they rarely have the nicest staff.   Today, it was slow because there was only me there, and the line got worse.   Management could consider remodeling its stores.  They should have no problem giving 5 former customers my business over you guys.  You seem to take less time and come out two or three minutes quicker.   Management should consider hiring more employees.  The lineup was terrible, and I left to get food elsewhere.
9385	Overall I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions
9386	We were very impressed by the atmosphere there as it was very nice and a good date spot the waiter was happy to help. The food took quite a while to arrive, but we did get free bread with olive oil. We got the seafood linguine as recommended as it was the waiter a popular dish.

The food took quite a while to arrive, but we did get free bread with olive oil. We got the seafood linguine as recommended by the waiter as it was a popular dish. I got the lobster meat ravioli and it was really great, very fresh and tasty. The bread was delicious as well and I couldn't get enough of it. The only issue that we had was the portions were small. The food was really good, however, I do think that there should be a higher portion for the price they are charging. we easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavorful and they add cheese at the top but definitely not worth the price so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach the bread was delicious as well and I couldn't get enough of it. There is no doubt that the food is tasty and the portions are smaller. Overall, I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions
9387	Here was the atmosphere was nice and a good date spot. The menu was a little confusing because it was in Italian, I think but the waiter was happy to help. I got the seafood linguine as recommended as the waiter as a popular dish. The food took quite a while to arrive but we did get free bread with olive oil but it was quite hard and dry so I didn't really like it and didn't eat it. When we got the food we were quite disappointed by the portion, as it was expensive for the small portion we got. We easily demolished the noodles in 5 minutes and felt hungry even after spending around $25. The noodles themselves were very tasty and flavourful and they add cheese at the top but definitely not worth the price so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach.

9389	Delicious food, even though it is a bit expensive, or at least for me, and I like seafood linguine more then pâtes, as opposed to linguine 'casera' with just a marinated artichoke. I like the waiter who served us very nice. What we got was the linguine seafood I don't know what else was in it, with the sauce and bread pieces. Thought the portion was small and definitely not to be splurging on... I think we spent around $25 or $30 on the meal. My husband on the other hand thought the portion was fine, I didn't think it was too big. The wines were also affordable but I doubt the meal would have been that expensive if we had used the discount coupons they provide. So again, a value for money, but I would not come again if I can get more or cheaper food, a good comfort food, but definitely not to be splurging on, as it definitely does not appeal to me and I don't go for fishy food.
9390	Getting more people to pay more money for service and dining is a good idea.  However, the customer service was terrible, and I found out my liver spots were worse on my lunch than mine were on my dinner.  Glad to have gotten a full refund.
9391	The Chinese buffet I tried was the best buffet I've ever eaten, better than the $5.99 Chinese buffet. Food was very fresh and salads were very well mixed. There's no sign of vegetables anywhere. The "roast beef" was large and the gravy was hot and congealed. I paid $19 for a Tuesday night.  It was better than any 5.99 Chinese buffet I've been to. I am a true fan of the Mandarin dining room.
9392	Best buffets I've ever been to are the $5.99 China buffet I tried once.  Food was very bland, selection was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the roast beef was the size of my fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you.  Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night.  Better off going to Mandarin.

9395	Even if they wore to plain clothes every day, they could worry about clothes by brands and number of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive, it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also, they could feel the feeling of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
9396	If we talked about what is to be done and the body does not, we wouldn't survive long. So make school uniform is very convenient, besides, I feel like family during my student days, because each of my friends wear the same school uniform.
9397	In my opinion, it is convenient that school uniform is used every day because it provides us with clothes as well as taking care of the clothes that each student used to be fashionable. Therefore, it is perfect that they wear uniforms every day to school. Although school uniform is expensive, the cost is much cheaper than buying new clothes for youngsters, so it is cheap and convenient, so wearing school uniform is the best.
9398	It is efficient for the rich to be wearing business suits and fancy dress in school uniform. The poor have to settle for plain clothes. Students are more sensible than teachers. It is very cheap. Students feel inferior. However, school uniform is very expensive, and the material is hard to wash and clean. Students are more concerned about clothes that they wear than teachers are.
9399	If school uniform is efficient in many ways then you should wear it. If you're concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes then get your own clothes and do what you want to do instead of wearing school uniform and complicating your life.
9400	Teaching students with creative thinking ability how to wear clothes that will not be wrapped up in the negative means they must be taught that designers and fashion lines will not look well in casual clothes so that is one more reason why uniforms must be no longer required.
9401	Strict guidelines about uniforms are out of step with today's society where casual apparel is acceptable, especially in the workplace. Kids wear whatever clothes they want, but kids at school can hardly ever wear pants to class. The strict guidelines are ridiculous. The kids will immediately be ostracized if they don't have a uniform, and social pressure will ultimately force them to have one.
9402	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
9403	Overall, wearing uniforms has become more of an extreme point and threatens the child's ability to express who they are. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to where their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.
9404	Uniforms are a classic example of destroying creativity. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to worn their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This effectively turning casual clothes into an unspoken excuse to wear different clothing.
9405	When young people are trying to find themselves there is no need to get rid of independence. I would not vote for children being punished for independent behavior.

9410	School uniform is an ugly and unnecessary practice. It is hard to clean. It's a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the morning.
9411	This is a terrible idea, uniforms are very expensive to clean, and it's pain. You would better get ready in advance.
9412	School uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and it is a pain if you have to put on a lot of things in the morning.
9413	In my opinion, it is bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and it is a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the morning.
9414	I think school uniform is a bad idea because cleaning uniforms is a lot of work and getting to wear lots of clothes in the morning is a pain.

The breadth and variety of Firefox add-ons is a critical advantage.

9430	The man is in a lot of trouble for sharing his spouse with someone he didn't even know. I would not be generous like that. But if the man genuinely admits his mistake, then I would not think about it. He could serve as a family example for the rest of his family.
9431	There is no arguing with you in this... you told me I had to be part of it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
9432	If you tell the truth and tell me it is my fault you know I would just be like, you told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
9433	I would say to my wife, 'you're the one who told me you had knowing part in it, and we are just going to go our separate ways. Truthfully I wouldn't want to know the first place.' And we would not go to court because the two of us would never see each other again. And if there were a child it would just be a case of ignoring it. But I would not go to court to protect the marriage, because that would just mean facing
9434	Instead of turning her in, I would just be like. You told me I had a role in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully, I wouldn't want to know.
9435	Give him my trust because he has my money. I know he won't give up his secret even if he gets into trouble because he would never go to jail.
9436	It would be a dangerous move to bring up ANYTHING that could lead to him killing anyone else. His secret is safe with me. He have my trust. I don't know anything...
9437	He has my trust and I would never let him down for no reason, plus his secret is safe with me...
9438	NO I wouldn't tell my boyfriend, since I wouldn't know the reasons he might have killed that person or it could have been for self-defense and if people ask me about anything I don't know NOTHING...He has my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason, plus his secret is safe with me...
9439	If he had something to hide I'd definitely not tell. I'd never, ever let him down for no reason. Plus, his secret is safe with me.
9440	If I had the chance to find out more about his cruelty or to take him down then I wouldn't turn him in. I think that the person who committed the crime deserves to be punished but I also think it's the victim's right to not turn him in. He has his rights and she has her rights. That's why I would wait to find out more about his crimes then I would act.
9441	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings are stronger that the fear of having a bad husband. I am not sure of my exact answer, but I am sure that I wouldn't want to look at him everyday and act like nothing happened. I believe that feelings are stronger than anything else and I wouldn't like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.

9445	If it was the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it is definitely no. People make mistakes and although it is a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life, I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of the murder in not saying anything, well then so be it.

9582	School uniform is a great idea, it eliminates all conflicts. In fact, the pupils can show their individuality.
9583	In my opinion, school uniform is a great idea. They, the rich, can show off in front of the others, and those who are poorer can avoid conflicts. As a rule, a lot of conflicts often occur between the girls, although it is not that uncommon between the boys. So what does uniform do? It eliminates all conflicts, one for all.
9584	It's a good idea, just because it makes impossible for students to hold a race for fashion or because one pupil is richer than another. That is why school uniform liquidates all conflicts between pupils. As a rule, it's a conflict between girls and boys. That is why school uniform liquidates all conflicts.
9585	In my opinion, school uniform is a good idea. Because there is a gap between rich and poor students, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they cared about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive, it's cheap and better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
9586	In my opinion, a school uniform is a good idea. Because there is a gap between the rich and poor, a uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore plain clothes every day, they might think about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Teenagers are practical so the poor students can feel inferior. Although a uniform is very expensive, it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, a uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
9587	Uniforms make it easier for schoolchildren to feel superior or inferior.Although uniform is expensive, it's cheap better than plain clothes. Because of the discrepancy between the rich and the poor, schoolchildren worry about clothes by brands and quantity. Teenager is rational, the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive, it's cheaper than plain clothes. Also they can feel the sense of kinship and a sense of belonging. In my opinion, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
9588	For the rich students, it is cheap and it is convenient because they don't need to worry about their clothes every day. But for poor students, it is expensive and inconvenient because it is time-consuming to decide what clothes to buy. But, the students who have an advantage in school can have better clothes. In short, school uniform is efficient in many ways.
9589	It is a good idea for school uniform because the gap between rich and poor is very big. Although wearing plain clothes every day is not convenient but to uniform such classy clothes can make the poor students feel inferior. They also feel a sense of belonging. This is a practical way to reduce inequality between the rich and poor, so the poor students can also feel happy and comfortable. Although school uniform is expensive but it is cheap than clothes; if they can't afford a uniform, they can't be a good student. It is a sensible idea because a student is a sensible person and they should not have clothes of high-quality brands during this college and school period. Another advantage is that they can feel with the sense of kinship. In my opinion, school uniform is good.
9590	Yes, I believe that it is nice to have a school uniform. Each school's uniform represents its goal for instant. I wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships. Furthermore, identical uniform also removes the wall of status. It also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof.

9592	I agree that there are benefits in having uniforms at schools. Each school's uniform signifies its goals for instant a white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue skirt of fidelity in relationships. Also, a uniform with a similar color removes the wall of status. It also depicts that each child comes from high or low class they are all treated equally under one roof.

9595	You should have a father. Maybe it is not the richest, most successful, or the nicest man, but at least a man. A loving man! You should have a man, no a lousy father. That is better than nothing. A rich man may not be happy with your mother, but at least you have a father. The rich man may not give a damn about you, the man will be very much a father. A father may not be very rich and may not be very kind, but he loves you. He is a man, a man not a piece of shit!
9596	Your father could teach you something but maybe not as much as a good teacher because your father is no such thing as a such thing as a good teacher. Probably you wouldn't even be able to remember the things your father would have taught you because of your father's lousiness.
9597	A lousy father can teach you more than anyone, maybe he will be able to teach you what not to be like, how not to act, how to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He can toughen you up. You will at least know who he was, and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy. You already know.
9598	My father could teach me what not to be like and how to act in life. I think he's more than enough to make me never wonder about him. I do not think any other man could do the same for me. I also know he is a good person. No other man in my life could be a better one.
9599	In terms of the example I'm thinking of, a bad father could teach more than none at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. The fact that you already know his true condition and his true disposition is not what I am talking about here. What I'm talking about is the fact that you can know the answers to some questions about your parents, from their own words or from the way they looked at you when you were small or from the letters that they wrote you when you were teenagers. That is a form of education, something that even you have not learned yet. So if your father is a lousy father, then you might know more than no one at all.

9605	TV is cool and TV is great. TV is like the baby in my womb. It is like the sun in the morning. It is like the cool brisk air on your first day of school. It is like the day you get diagnosed with cancer. It is like the day you find out that you are lesbian. It is like the day that you realize you just wasted your time reading this.
9606	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it is educational.

9615	Naas it's wrong and reality marriage is intended for man and woman. One way of saying to reproduce is marriage.
9616	Biblically, it's wrong and realistically, marriage is intended for man and a woman, as a way of saying to reproduce.
9617	basing the Bible is definitely wrong and realistically marriage is intended for man and a woman one way of saying to reproduce.
9618	The Bible is so narrow. Marriage is only for man and woman. Its simply a way to reproduce.
9619	By the bible, marriage is intended only for a man and a woman. Realistically, however, it's one way of saying to reproduce.

9625	From a biological standpoint, men and women were naturally designed to be in this relationship. This idea was corrupted by society.

9630	An action is ethically right if doing so would benefit society as a whole. It is not ethical if doing so would benefit society as a whole.
9631	Fair enough? If everyone has a gay marriage, then society as a whole would benefit from it because there would be no more human extinction. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, gay marriage cannot be ethical. You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
9632	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? If everyone were human, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one life on the planet there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. Therefore, human beings can't be ethical. You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
9633	An action is ethical if the society as a whole would benefit. Fair enough? If everyone had a gay marriage, then the society as a whole would benefit. I see an issue that there are straight people and they are safe and protected. Also, if a straight person who wants to get married and has a legitimate fear of AIDS was going through with his or her wedding, the society as a whole would benefit. Why not give them marriage?
9634	An action is ethical if all the members of the society would benefit if we all did that. What I mean is that if gay marriage is ethical then it will make society as a whole better off. If a kid is being bullied at school it will only be bullying if there is also one person who doesn't teach it.

9640	India moving a step ahead in becoming a world power everyday.. Concerns shown by other countries is an indication that it is a big country and that it can grow as one of the leading powers. Yes we have some internal problems which countries don't have, but time is river water and it brings changes. We grow as one of the leading powers. I won't compare my country with others as Napoleon said 'Comparing yourself with others is same as insulting yourself'. We have the third largest army in the world.

9645	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.

9649	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity are poor, but at least they are less corrupted than Muslim religion. The alternative is Islam. Theology and philosophy are shown to be unsound, as are the conclusions concerning the nature of the universe that are derived from them. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
9650	No one EVER said scientific truth is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science, science admits it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is so dogmatic it even doesn't accept facts. Even just what truth really stands for.
9651	No one ever said science is PERFECT. That's the difference between Religion and Science. Religion is dogmatic enough to not even recognise FACTS. And even just what truth really stands for.
9652	No one ever said science is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science, science admits it doesn't have all the answers while religion is so dogmatic that it even doesn't recognise facts. And even just what truth really stands for.
9653	Science does not admit that it does not have all the answers. Religion is so dogmatic that it does not even recognise facts. And even if it did, the Truth really stands for something.
9654	Science has its limits, and even if it were perfect, it's religious metaphysics would be so unnecessarily rigid and prohibitive that it would be unenforceable.
9655	The Bible has hundreds of examples of prophecies that came true. The highest profile example being the time and space of Jesus. The New Testament was not written until 200 years after Christ's death. It starts with the gospel accounts and ends in the life of James the son of Alphaeus. That's quite a time span! So who am I to doubt the Bible's accuracy? These are prophecies that came true for a reason and for a purpose. I would not wish such things on anyone. If I could wish a wish, I would wish nothing in particular but I would wish it to come true. Yes, I was born with a gift and the ability to read the Bible. It's kind of like a charism. It is not a given gift that comes with birth.
9656	There is no true reason that any given deity is unreasonable because you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser. What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations. There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
9657	The greatest reason to find a particular deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything they have ever said, and we wouldn't be the wiser. The lowest common denominator to replace any given deity with lies and contradictions is that they have lied about at least a few very important things to mankind. No one has ever produced a single true prophecy about what humans would ever do. All prophecies are just lies.
9658	Which person would you think is more reasonable, Jesus of Nazareth, God, or you? It's pretty clear that Jesus is unreasonable, but so is God. I wouldn't know. It's up to you what you choose to believe.
9659	We all believe that the Bible is a true record of God's true words. But you can also find prophecies in other religions that haven't come true. Yes, the Bible is the most reliable record of God's words, but you can find more truth in other parts of the world than in the Bible.
9660	My kids won't spank me because I'm not their ruler. So to spank my children out of love, I'm gonna spank them on the butt.
9661	After I was spanked I never did the same thing twice... So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
9662	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice. So I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
9663	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice, so I would spank my children out of love, and on the butt.
9664	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice. So, I would spank my children, out of love and on the butt.
9665	Yes, because that way the child will learn not to do it again, because it really hurt, and I know this from experience.
9666	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and I know this from experience.
9667	Yes because it could be a child that made a mistake.
9668	Yes, it does hurt. Most of the time, kids stop doing it because they know it really hurts.
9669	Yes, because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and I know this from experience.
9670	Yes, I believe it should be spanked only if he knows he is wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9671	Yes I believe in spanking a child to deter them from doing the wrong thing. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9672	In short I think you shouldn't spank a child but only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9673	You should spank your child when they know they are doing wrong things, instead of making a big fuss. It's better if the child is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9674	Yes, I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
9675	One of the key components to Christianity is FAITH. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.
9676	You can't just say you have faith in God. Faith is knowing God, or even knowing that you believe that God exists, and trusting God, but trusting Him in what way? Faith to Christians is the same way.

9678	In point of view, we can't see faith, but we know it's there, because of what happened when Christ walked the earth. I think that our belief in Christ is what really helps shape our way of life.
9679	Jesus is the founder of Christianity. It consists of many different beliefs, such as the belief in God's existence and a belief in many other supernatural things.
9680	Jesus loved me, so I am on this side.
9681	I love Jesus so I am on this side. So is my neighbor who lives down the block. Who's
9682	I am on this side because I love Jesus.
9683	JESUS loves everyone. So he/she supports those that fight against evil.
9684	 I love jesus so I am on this side, how can I be on both side? What is the
9685	I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home, grew a pair and asked themselves why you worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist.
9686	Everyone on the other side of this argument was raised in a Christian home, grow a pair and ask yourself, why do I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist?
9687	No one I think was raised in a Christian home. Think more along the lines of reason why do I disagree with this cultist.
9688	Excuse me, did you just say, I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist?
9689	Yeah, I assume everyone on this side of this argument was raised in a Christian home and growing a pair and ask yourself, why do I worship a scruffy sandal wearing cultist.
9690	We should come together to fight scientologists, right now.
9691	Because right now, those scientologists are running rampant. We should be fighting them together.
9692	It is our turn now to come together and fight scientologists.
9693	Now, why are we fighting? Right now, scientologists are running rampant. We need to come together to fight them.
9694	People are fighting right now between scientologists and independents for different reasons and therefore the government will have to fight them to end the war.
9695	Spanking should be necessary, but it shouldn't last more than a minute. Punishment can last for up to two or three weeks or maybe longer, depending on the offense committed.
9696	My opinion is no spanking should be necessary, spanking would last only one minute, but punishing could last up to two or three weeks or maybe even more.
9697	I don't think spanking is necessary and punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more
9698	spanking is unnecessary as a punishment because you can punish children in a minute. But, punishing can last up to two or three weeks or perhaps longer.
9699	Spanking is unnecessary, a minute spanking lasts, but corporal punishment can last up to two or three weeks or possibly longer.
9700	No, because if we hit our children they will think that we do not love them.
9701	It would probably make the situation worse instead of better because it could make the child feel more lonely.
9702	If you hit your children, they will think that you don't love them.
9703	No, hitting a child doesn't make them think that you don't love them, it makes them feel bad.
9704	No, because if we hit our children, they won't know that we love them.
9705	There's no need to spank kids because in my opinion it doesn't work. Maybe it works for once, but as kids grow up it doesn't make sense to spank them because then you won't have a good relationship with them and the relationship won't grow. There are other techniques they can learn from.
9706	spanking is a bad technique, because they become dependent upon it and cannot see their mistakes, and would continue to break boundaries and mess around. There are other techniques they can learn from.
9707	"No, I don't think they should be spanked. In my opinion I don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then you won't have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from."
9708	I don't think parents should be spanked because in my opinion I don't think it works. Maybe it will once, but as they grow up it isn't a good technique to do, because then you won't have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There are other techniques they can learn from.
9709	It doesn't work, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then they won't have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.
9710	Not every thing begins with violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if its necessary. In case of loud noises or truicking they should call on to the police,
9711	Not everything begins with violence, parents should not hit children for discipline. Only if it is necessary.
9712	Parents shouldn't hit their kids if it is unnecessary.
9713	Parents shouldn't hit children for discipline, only if it's necessary.
9714	Parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if necessary.
9715	I don't agree with spaking as an option to discipline because the children are not going to be scared of what their parents are going to say to them, and because if you do that to your children are learning what their parents show them, and because that is not going to help much the children
9716	Parents use spaking as an option to discipline because if parents use spaking as an option to discipline the kids will be not scared of what their parents are going to them. Also because it will help more with the learning for the children. And because they wont be scared of what their parents are going to them. So spaking is an option to parents to dicipline the children.
9717	I disagree with parents using talking as a option to discipline because kids are not going to be afraid of what their parents are saying and if you do it to your childrens you're teaching them what they see you do it and it is not helping much to your children
9718	As far as I as concerned, some parents use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but I don't agree with them because children are not going to be afraid of what their parents are going to them, since spanking is not going to hurt them. On the other hand, as far as I as concerned, sometimes spanking doesn't help much to the child to learn a good habit.
9719	I agree that parents should not spank, slap, or tase their children. However, I disagree that spanking, slapping, or tasing is an option to discipline. Children do not need to be scared of their parents because if we can correct our actions with reasoning, they should not be scared. For example, suppose we agree that you need to apologize for your actions and make a sincere promise to not do it again. According to this system, you should not be scared of your parents because you have already been punished.
9720	If my spouse killed a person out of self-defense or out of defense for another person then I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold-heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
9721	If you don't kill another human being because of self-defense, then definitely not. If he rapes you, and you die...yes.
9722	If it were the case that my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person or it was a case where the person was killed for killing someone, then no I wouldn't turn them in. An other case would be where it was a case where the person was killed cold heartedly like rape, money, objects and or just pure disliking or a person. Then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
9723	Yes in some instances, but not in others. I would not turn them in. My spouse should not kill a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person. They should not kill for killing another person. Their killing should only be for the reason of hot blooded killing or rape or for money or for objects and or purely for a dislike of another person. In those instances, yes, I would turn them in. If they killed cold, heartedly, for something other than a pure dislike, I would also turn them in.
9724	Yes, some circumstances but no if the person did not do it for money, for a career, for something they disliked or just because they were broke. Also, No if they killed coldheartedly like rape, for money or for objects and or just a pure disliking or a person. If they did it for their betterment, like they helped people or society then yes.
9725	We are all probably aware of these types of people, it is unfortunate that a lot of these cases are never reported, but I do think it would be smart to have some sort of system in place where if people are seen to have these types of problems, they are suspected and had been investigated, they have been given warnings, etc then maybe these kind of people would come forward for the welfare of society and not for their own..
9726	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. There are too many innocent people getting killed around us by these people that are affiliated with the wars. The point is, they only keep killing because they get away with it. If they could be caught, and they can't because they are in places where the government can't reach, I'd turn them in for their own safety.
9727	Just because your spouse went to the store with you doesn't mean he isn't going to kill you. That is why you have to turn him in and get him in jail. This is not a lie. We have witnessed how many crimes have been committed in this country. Although this isn't the only case in this country where people get murdered but still, this is our experience. If your spouse are a paranoid person you have to know this and even if he is innocent it's not ok to let him kill you. There is no limit to his vengeance, especially if he gets caught.
9728	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they kill once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.
9729	You would have to turn your spouse in because it is hard to turn people in that you have a deep connection with but it's something that you have to do for your own safety.
9730	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same as ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So yeah, I'd turn them in.
9731	Murder is absolutely wrong. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So yes, i would turn them in.
9732	Some people commit the act of murder because they know the consequences. They know that they are guilty. But I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder, so I would turn them in.
9733	Under any circumstance, murder is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So, yeah, i would turn them in.
9734	Murder under any circumstance is not correct. A person who commits this act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I would not be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. So yes, I would turn them in.
9735	we are not the ones who gave the baby life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
9736	We did not create the child, we are not the ones who gave it life. Why should we be the ones who put it to death. We have no authority to do such a thing.
9737	we didn't create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death? We have no authority to do such a thing.

9739	We did not create the child, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
9740	I choose life because Reagan once said something like this. Notice that everyone who is pro choice has been born or is currently alive.
9741	That many who speak out against abortion don't even know they are born
9742	We should choose life, Reagan said something like this, so one should be careful what you say, if you say something positive about abortion there will be negative opinions.
9743	When Reagan said that in his campaign he is pro choice, but his real meaning is live birth.
9744	At the time Reagan said something like this, there were only those people who wanted abortion because they wanted to live. Nowadays there are those people that want abortion and the ones that want to live.

9750	There is no such thing as a pure life. There is only life which makes you happy.
9751	In the Declaration of Independence it does not state that Americans have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
9752	In point of view, it's not illegal to kill someone, but it's an unjust practice. In the declaration of independence, it says that we have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
9753	It doesn't say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life liberty and happiness but it says "the pursuit of happiness"]. Here is some text: {Don't you think people could be treated better in hospitals if they had access
9754	It does not say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life, liberty, or happiness.
9755	Advancing the common good can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
9756	There is a great divide in thought between people today, especially when it comes to personal goals and going against the common good. Some people want to work in concert with the common good, while other people simply want to maximize their own ability in whatever way, no matter what the consequences might be for society. I am responsible for myself and the consequences of my actions because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. I am not playing or pretending to be some sort of common good when I really only care about what I personally get out of it. There is a great divide in thought between people today, especially when it comes to personal goals and going against the common good. Some people want to work in concert with the common good, while other people simply want to maximize their own ability in whatever way, no matter what the consequences might be for society. So I choose a personal pursuit because I believe that the pursuit of a personal goal is an individual's decision, and advancing the common good is
9757	Personal pursuits will always be different for different people. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
9758	Personal pursuits are important because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. In advancing the common good, your choices could be different from the choices of others, but you could never be on an equal footing because you never have to work as hard as you do in the pursuit of a common good, and standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
9759	On the personal direction, a personal pursuit is more important than advancing the common good. On the personal direction, every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. On the personal direction, advancing the common good would mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done.

9760	Before you can help others, you have to help yourself. For example, if you don't have your life together, how are you going to help others with theirs? If you're still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one wants to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. So, basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.
9761	In certain cases you have to help yourself first before you can help others. For instance, if you don't have your life together, how are you going to help someone else with theirs. If you still live at home with your mother, and you don't have a job, and one wants to help out, by giving to an organization, you couldn't do that. So basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.
9762	It is better to help yourself before you can help others, for instance, if you don't have your life together, how are you going to help someone else with theirs. If your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it.

9765	Every American endeavors advancing the common good which is why they are screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors advancing the common good, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good than it is to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good.

It is easier to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good than it is to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit; this is why communism failed.
9769	Human nature is to pursue personal advantage. If you assume that human nature is to pursue advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who pursues personal advantage.

9770	Yes it's illegal. The consequence of it is going to be... you and your friend going around to each house and cleaning them up. Just like when people toilet paper. A few years ago when i was a minor my brother and i went around drawing on people garage doors in chalk...long story short we got caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. Have fun... :)"
9771	Yes it is illegal. The consequences are going to be.... you and your friend going to each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people toilet paper.

Have fun... :)  ps... I keep reading some of these answers (HAHA)...your not going to go juvenile jail and you aren't going to be charged as long as it's not bad words  Go be a teenager
9772	Yes, it's illegal. The consequences are going to be much worse than if you just had a few cans thrown at your house. Just like when people throw toilet paper, a few years ago, my brother and I went around drawing on people's garage doors with chalk, then we were caught and we had to clean every single garage door.  I'm not sure what teenage jail is, but it doesn't sound like anything fun. Go be a teenager.
9773	It is indeed illegal. The consequences for this type of activity would be serious you and your friend going each house and cleaning it up. Just like when people take selfies with their phone. A few years ago when i was a minor, my brother and i, went around drawing on people garage doors in chalk...long story short, we got caught and had to go around and clean every single garage. You can go be a teenager.
9774	It's illegal, the consequences will be.... You and your friend going around cleaning up all the graffiti from all the houses. Same goes for toilet paper. A few years ago when I was a minor my brother and I went around drawing on cars with chalk, long story short we were caught and had to go around and clean all the garages.  I assume that you don't want to go juvenile or anything. You don't want to cause an offense so I assume the best is to not do anything 
9775	Even if guns are banned and not allowed in your area, some people will still be outlaws and someone is bound to still have a gun.]. Here is some text: {This is an argument...this same thing with preventing murders in movies like "scream" and "stranger things"  just because you don't like that movie doesn't mean it's appropriate because people have different reasons for their choices or for buying certain things that they think are appropriate and immoral
9776	In fact, there are countless instances in history where what the Nazi's did is the beginning of a dictatorship. Yes, it should have been banned in the beginning.
9777	Well I actually think that outlaws and cops become indistinguishable once the rights are taken from a citizen. Do you honestly believe that every cop in your town is honorable and trustworthy?
9778	One of the first things the Nazis did in coming to power was to ban the private possession of firearms. There's a reason; when they wanted to knock the door down and carry people away without due process of law, they didn't want anyone to be able to fight back. It is also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now, some would say no, outlaws and cops. I argue that at that point, those two groups become indistinguishable. Do you honestly believe that every cop in your town is honorable and trustworthy?
9779	In point of view when Hitler came to power, he started to restrict the private ownership of firearms.  There is a reason; when they wanted to knock the door down and carry people away without due process of law, they didn't want anyone to be able to fight back. There is also true that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Now some people say it's true that only outlaws and cops.

9780	Only in an ideal world do ideals work in an ideal way. In our real world, it is much more likely for a poor person to be convicted of a felony than a rich person.

9784	In theory, an ideal world does indeed work the way that an ideal world is supposed to. In our real world, however, it is much more likely that a poor person will be convicted of a felony than a rich person. So if we effectively remove from the voting population ex-felons, poor communities will be denied equal representation in state and local government.   You can read some articles about the difference between de facto and de jure representation. I'm sure that you will find the subject interesting and enlightening.
9785	No. You still have to pay rent. Here are some things you can do: if the landlord does not repair the landlord can do one of the following: take the rent due to the local clerk of courts, the tenant must be current with the clerk of courts (called rent deposit). The tenant does not need an attorney for rent depositing, the tenant can request the court to order the landlord to repair the condition, the court can also lower the rent until the condition is rectified or give the tenant a few dollars of the rent so that the tenant can pay the repairs. end lease, cancel the rental agreement and move, in such cases, the tenant must give the appropriate notice, and the landlord has failed to do the repairs.

9787	To evict a tenant, you are required to get a court order. You do not need an attorney for this.  You may cancel the lease or end the contract and move, if the tenant does not make any repairs to the property within 30 days after receiving the court order.

9790	Adultery is against the law where you live, and although you may have a cause of action for alienation of affection, what you really have is mislaced anger.

You may be physically assaulting the woman, but that does not make you justified to evict or to be physically abusive with your spouse.  Your spouse committed adultery, not you.  Get out.  This is the one time in life when you would actually really just really like to just stomp on people and crush people and break their fingers.  Just so you could understand more about life.  So you'd have to deal with not being able to do that for the rest of your life.

9795	Depends on what the contract says, I suppose.  It may call for mutual satisfaction, or give you a right to ask for them to be redone.  Most likely you have to pay anyway. The issue may not be best approached by means of "legal recourse" if you've not done so, tell the designer how unhappy you are and why, and ask that the designs be redone.  It may be that the designed will work with you to redo the work -- it would be in the designers' long-run best interests to see that their customers are happy with the design.

9800	What kind of a question is that? A simple yes or no answer would have done this question.
9801	It is a deliberate insult, because it was first given currency specifically to offend.
9802	Your question would have much more validity if it were "why did white people decide to use that word as a deliberate term of offense in the first place?" No one knows or can answer the question: "Why white people decided to be racist?" But it IS important to understand that if white people were to 'back off' racism, they would be saying "we no longer want to see a code for racism in this country".
9803	Yeah we know that black people use the word within their own community, just as gay people use the word "queer". But that doesn't change the fact that the word was first given currency as a deliberate insult.
9804	While the use of the word 'white' as a term of offense has been known for long times, it's usage should be condemned since its origin within the racial terms. Because this word can be used as a derogatory term, not just as a condemnation term.
9805	Because the number of people living in a small area of Manhattan tends to be higher than the number of people living in other cities that are spread out, most other cities clean the streets less frequently.  In Phoenix, Arizona, they pick up garbage once a week and sweep only once a week.  We are more spread out than Manhattan.  If NYC did not clean as often as it does, there would be a lot of garbage all over the street.
9806	If NYC did not clean as often as it does, there would be a lot of garbage all over the street.

If New York City did not clean as often as it does, there would be a lot of garbage all over the street.
9809	In the large cities, they pick up garbage once a week and only once a week sweep the street. In small cities, they pick up garbage twice a week and twice a week sweep the street. Because the cities are spread out, it takes longer for the garbage to get swept.
9810	Any sexual assault, even if a father does it to his daughter or a step-father to his step-daughter, involves an adult male and a minor female and not a minor female and an adult male, so the man should be alone responsible for everything.
9811	He should have never put you in a criminal situation to begin with.  Obviously he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of possibly going to jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done....if he is a man at all, he should be the one apoligizing to you
9812	The way he put you in a criminal situation is the whole reason why he should apologize. First thing he should have never put you in that situation to begin with.  Obviously he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of going to jail. So I would let him sit in there and think about what he has done....if he is a man at all, he should be the one apoligizing to you.
9813	Being a man means that he should apologize to you for raping you, even if he told you that he loved you and that he was only doing it to be free from jail.
9814	Ok, hun, he is an adult and I take it that you are a minor?  First thing, he should have never put you in a criminal situation to begin with.  Obviously he didn't care enough about you to keep you out of possibly going to jail, so I would just let him sit in there and think about what he has done....if he is a man at all, he should be the one apoligizing to you.
9815	No I don't think so,not in a civilised society. If a great power decided it necessary to commit evil acts there would be war,uproar,hatred and bloodshed, for real crimes. If a terrible egregious egomaniac like Saddam Hussein should be sentenced to death the world would probably have ended by now. For serious crimes, I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment. I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
9816	On a serious crime, I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment...I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
9817	No, I do not think so, not in a civilized society. I guess you're asking this in relation to the impending trial verdict on Saddam Hussein. If he is sentenced to death, there will be further violence, hatred and bloodshed. For serious crimes, I think a life sentence in prison is the appropriate punishment... I can't see how killing someone solves anything.
9818	Impending verdict on Saddam Hussein can be applied to any murder in Iraq. A life sentence in prison is the only punishment that can be applied to any murder committed in an un-regulated and unpunished society like Iraq.
9819	In our society, serious crimes are punished by a life sentence in prison. I cannot see how killing someone solves anything.
9820	If you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to have a drink.
9821	I believe that there has to be a legal age limit to drink because for some people, the development of the human brain is not completed at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol at an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit. I personally believe that if you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to have a drink.
9822	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18. This means that it might lead to more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, I think it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit. I personally believe that if you are old enough to die for your country you should be old enough to have a drink.
9823	It seems to me that a person who is old enough to die for his country should be old enough to drink alcoholic beverages.
9824	Believe me, there is nothing actually wrong with the normal development of the human brain in an 18 year old. For some people, the development of the human brain isn't complete at the age of 18. This poses a risk of more serious damage being done from alcohol in an 18 year old. Whether or not true, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit. I personally believe that if you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to have a drink.
9825	Yes, and they need to be pared down now. The child protective services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason. They do the children more damage than good by ripping them from families with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time. Even saying "DHS" in relation to this situation lost one set of grandparents visitation rights with the kids. This is way, way beyond the scope of their original job.
9826	Babies should be protected by the Children's Protective Services only if there is a real or substantial risk. The chances of traumatic abuse never merit it in my experience. Children are just so much more precious to God. It may be more difficult to hear than you think, but don't worry, we'll get them eventually.
9827	Yes. And they need to be pared down now. The child protective services in my state make an awful mess of families with no real proof of any reason.

9830	To be exact, all of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to courts about. Regardless of court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the'so called' victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
9831	The main trick in sex cases is whether the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. Regardless of whether a case is going to court or not, the trick is whether the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. Of course one fine line may be what the judges are doing about statutory rape in which the so called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. I do not know of specific court cases, unfortunately.
9832	All of them is true because in the laws which people use the rules are pretty simple. If one knows rape is really an act that is pretty simple. Every legal expert says even though it is a whole close decision. I don't know in the laws it does not have to go to court. All that one person doing this to another person, it will be involved, or the person knows it is wrong, because if you are not in violation it is not considered rape in the law.
9833	Unfortunately a lot of the rape problems are because of a lack of knowledge in society. Women in some countries aren’t taught how to dress and stand up for themselves. In other countries, the entire crime is punished extremely harshly. A good number of rapes occur because the attacker thinks that they’re getting away with something because the victim doesn’t fight back or because they’re afraid to say they wanted to stop. Still others have set up false rapes as weddings to get the victims to move away. For all these reasons, rape is still an issue in a lot of communities. It seems like the courts haven’t learned how to help the victims. In some cases, it is still believed that the best thing a woman can do to deal with her situation is just to get pregnant.
9834	There are two ways you can classify rapes. The first of which is based on criminal acts and what can be penalised or criminalised. The second of which is simply to consider that rape is always an offence and to categorise it so as to include all types of rape. I will focus on the latter option, namely the categorisation of rape as a single act. I will therefore say that the courts have portrayed rape as a single offending. So I am not altogether sure why they have all that trouble with the individual cases?
9835	No baby would decide on anything. I don't think I would want my brain sucked out and stabbed in the skull. It is better to let a woman do that. I am sure that many people support this because they believe women have a certain right to do what they want, right? People that support this should be forced to watch the cutting of a child, live.
9836	How selfish are the women who think it's all about them and what they want? People who support this should be forced to watch one being performed..!! LIVE!
9837	What about the babies choice. No baby would decide to live or not. I think that they have to let the women make the choice regarding the abortion. People who support these should be forced to watch one being performed live. LIVE!
9838	Many of these answers talk about the woman's choice of whether she should have the baby be fully or partially born, and the baby's choice of whether it wants to be born with the pain and hurts of being cut out of its mother's body, and be left in a hospital while others watch as it dies. However, I think the woman should decide whether or not she wants to go through the pain of being torn from her body and should therefore be able to have a botched procedure. We should also raise awareness about early abortions or abortions on demand.
9839	No baby would choose this, they don't have the right to choose. Women are just more focused on protecting and upholding their rights then those of their fetuses. People who support this should be forced to watch one being performed......LIVE!
9840	To answer your question it's possible, sure. Your question is difficult to answer because it really depends on the practice of a particular courthouse or judge.  Many federal courts require individuals with cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, etc. to leave them with the Marshal Service.   If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt. My guess is that most judges wouldn't go as far as to hold someone in contempt if it was off. But I've personally seen a person's phone get confiscated b/c there was a concern that the individual was attempting to take pictures of witnesses with it in a drug case (i.e.--witness intimidation).

9845	Do not write the estate agent a letter to make him aware of the problem.
9846	To protect the sellers interests one must contact the landlord so that the property is re-landed in a way that safeguards the interests of the sellers. The letter could use words such as {that the house cannot be sold, it is the same owner, the house must not be re-landed, the property needs re-landings
9847	On a situation of an extension to the property that does not have the proper foundations (as provided by planning law) this could be considered illegal. A letter to a Realtor about the lack of foundation trussing could lead to misconception and in some cases there could be a breach of regulations in relation to the ownership of this property.
9848	The whole thing sounds dodgy to me. An extension without the proper footings is not legal and if it has been built without planning permission that to is not legal. The estate agent should also be made aware of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
9849	Real estate is a mine field and a lot of times the best advice is to stay out of it altogether or at least work with someone that knows how to navigate it. The estate agent should also be made aware of the problem as he could be in real trouble.
9850	It seems what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws.  We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm.  What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives."  I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of a person's health care if they've chosen self harming behavior. (Examples:  seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.)  If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.

9853	The fact is that we do pass laws to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- however I don't understand why we have not been legislating all forms of self-harm. What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives."  I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to protect other taxpayers from being obligated to shoulder a large portion of a person's health care costs should they have chosen self harming behavior (e.g. seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.)  If we were just honest, and say that these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to bear the costs associated with the injuries we cause in less "safe" behavior, I think many of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
9854	Inconsistencies of laws? And what laws are these that need to be debated so much? We have laws such as the seatbelt laws, we have regulations governing recreational drug use, etc. Why is it okay for politicians to make a law without noticing the harsh regulations placed on some? If they were just honest, they would realize that as a society we don't like to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured. If we were just honest, we would realize that there are laws out there (like the seatbelt law) that are meant to protect other people. If we were just honest, we would realize that there are laws out there that are meant to allow us to legally obtain and use some drugs.
9855	You can't export democracy to Muslim countries by force because it takes the will of the people to form such a government.  The countries in the Middle East do not have the Enlightenment background that we had in the nascent United States to form a secular Constitutional Republic.  Islam demands that church and state be as one with the rule of law coming from the Koran.  Despite the efforts by some right wing conservative religious types, in America we have a wall of separation between religion and the government where a citizen can follow the dictate of his/her conscience.  Islam needs to go through their own Enlightenment before any type of western democracy will have a chance to succeed.  Until then we can only keep (weak) control by military force which sets up blowback as we now see in the Middle East.
9856	Democracy is not something that Muslims have by force. In Islamic nations democracy still requires the will of the people.

9858	We cannot export Democracy because it takes the will of the people to form such a government, as it takes time and the full support of a majority.

9865	Not knowing why you and your daughter s father are not together my advice can only be very generalized. If he refuses to pass a drug screening, then most likely his custody will not go through. Drug tests are administered at sentencing and drug courts are huge. I wish you all the luck.

9871	You do have to judge your own people with some common sense, please. There are quite a number of illegal immigrants in our prisons and jails for rape, murder, drugs smuggling and theft.

9880	The Supreme Court has ruled on this already, and as long as the first amendment is not altered, abortion should be legal.  The S. Court ruled abortion should be legal based on a person's 1st Amd right to privacy over what happens to their body. It has nothing to do with when life begins,etc... as some would like it to. It is all about this great country's freedoms and constitution giving us protections over our personal self.

9883	Abortion is a judgment that should be made by the woman and her doctor. While abortion in the first trimester is not illegal, it is less free. There are laws in place where people should be prevented from aborting until a certain age. On the other hand, there is much support for abortion regardless of it's legality.

9885	It doesn't make sense to us since cigarettes are not an illegal drug and they can still be used legally without law enforcement know so it isn't a loss of money since smoking costs taxpayers money to support all the workers who support it but as an answer I would say it could save lives due to so many people dying from illnesses caused by smoking which is just the kind of harm being illegalization of cigarettes would cause to the population from the harms of them smoking it would save their lives making them still save lives for other people to do damage instead of being recreational and risky that is how it would function to me not as legal smoking or legalizing is what you would get from me and i didn't say it would cost the government money but in my opinion that has nothing to do with it but it is still an idea to support and i would love to see the day where illegal cigarettes would be gone and that day has come for less then one percent of smokers still illegal cigarettes still smoked it is just the hassle of passing it across your body and the legal

You do not have to worry about having a seizure or an aneurysm or needing a heart transplant due to smokes’ toxic effects.  You can see your life flash before your eyes as the lung is destroyed within days or weeks. You can shorten your life expectancy by having to live with lung cancer and other deadly diseases and the financial suicide of paying off the mortgage and funeral expenses.  You can be dead before you think it is likely you will become a living vegetable.  That is why I think you are a lier. You don't have to lie and hide because we all smoke tobacco. We all eat whatever they want us to eat
9887	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' lives, money, and health. It would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. I don't think that is a loss of money. It would only save lives and money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to crash. I would love to see that day. All those sleaseballs selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers and medics and firefighters. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.

9890	Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but separate". However, when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking. Mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not "separate" but still "unequal" due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools.
9891	Appropriate? Try saying that with reasonable arguments. The state school is not very good, but most students receive college education. What should the racist board decision be changed to? Civil rights laws have been a great advancement and help to eliminate racial injustice throughout the country. The Brown v. Board ruling is only the beginning of Americans getting the equal opportunity that the founding fathers envisioned for all Americans. There should be equal opportunity of which education is a huge part of that.

I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time).

9900	In North Carolina there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated firearm safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check, and fill out an application for a hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with....New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns. Why isn't there a national standard on the gun law? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something straight out of the Constitution?
9901	In point of view, I'm all for stricter gun laws for their safety.
9902	There's already a three day waiting period in most states. Some states make it longer. If gun law is a state issue, it would be more appropriate for individual states to be able to do so.
9903	Yes, there is a three day waiting period in North Carolina to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it.

9905	We live in an unprecedented age where people can no longer trust their government. The problem is that it's due to the flawed criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and guarantees, people sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better addressed people will not be able to trust our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone. Unfortunately, our justice system is unique in the world, it would let 10 guilty people go than send one innocent person to jail, which I can't argue with, but hopefully, in the future, people will realize that it's a mess and someone will fix it.

9907	This is a very political issue, one where people sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and we can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I think that until these issues are better dealt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone.

9908	That issue about the justice system is a very important one. I don't know if in other countries they have similar issues with justice, but in this country people don't believe in their system until it actually benefits them personally. So until the system is fixed, people don't believe it is just. It's all about promises, and I feel like they're being talked into something that they aren't willing to do when it doesn't benefit them personally. When people get wronged by another person in the first place, it's possible for them to believe that the justice system is working, and that good things are going to happen to them when the case is over. But when the same person gets actual justice when his/her case is resolved, it doesn't change the belief that the justice system isn't going to do anything good. 
9909	I think the main problem with the trust issue is mainly due to the iffy criminal justice system. In order for law to work it must be swift, severe, and gauranteed. People sit on death row for 15 years, child rapists have been released with simple probations for treatment and no punishment, and you can commit the same crime in 2 places, one gets you probation and the other gets you 20 years. I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to "correct" anyone.

9910	To get rid of your attorney, inform the business of the incident and request the name of their ins. provider. Often they make reasonable offers. Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your states max. small claims award by $1000 should you even consider discussing the matter with an attorney. Unless you were injured and treated professionally (have a bill) your case is weak. Damages for pain and suffering with this type of occurance will be aprox. $1000 unless you can prove the incident was the result of negligence or malice. If you hire an attorney it is likely there won't be enough money left to pay the bill for your care.
9911	Don't hire an attorney if your injuries/damages do not exceed the maximum your state allows for small claims. Hiring an attorney won't help if you did not get care for your injuries. For pain and suffering there is a cap in most states. An attorney may be worth hiring in some cases where there is a medical injury and it is a result of bad workmanship or defect in the equipment you were in.
9912	While retaining an attorney is a good option if it would cost more then $1000 to meet the small claims officer recommendation, it probably isn't. If it did cost you more then $1000, you might want to consider contacting your insurance company and find out what they would be willing to pay.
9913	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
9914	Before retaining a lawyer $$$, consider contacting the business and informing them of the incident and request the name of their insurance provider. Often they make reasonable offers. (in this case Doctors bill plus $1000) Only if they refuse and your injuries/damages exceed your state’s maximum small claims award by $1000 should you even consider discussing the matter with an attorney.

9915	Mexicans are not being persecuted in America. Even those that are here illegaly. Although there seems to be more public sentiment against illegals here of late. I would blame that on the media or the politicians that make an issue of it more than anything else. I've lived in Texas for my entire life, and I've never heard one complaint about illegals until the last few weeks when the media started blasting it out the airways. Unfortunately, I have noticed that the media has a large affect on the public opinion here. Why they have chosen this time to make it a major issue is beyond anything I can understand.
9916	This sentence is not true. The media has not promoted this issue as big a deal as it is here.

9920	Yes, legally it has and done.   The infamous urban legend of biker chicks knocking a guy down and having it's way with him in a park is an example.   The reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by definition. Guys like sex. If they are not in a relationship they have little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex.   A guy weak enough to be "raped" would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage. Especially a married or engaged man. However it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.
9921	Why can't a guy have unwanted sex? Why couldn't a guy have unwanted sex? Why wouldn't a guy have unwanted sex? A guy might be embarrassed to admit that he wanted to have unwilling sex, and has two options.   He can be a wolf if he wants to hide his weakness. He can get a condom that lets him stuff it on himself if he's not feeling adventurous.   However he can make use of his sexual stamina. If he has a lot of unwilling sex partners, he can get out a few hundreds dollars a time for his service. He has a reputated blue book online where such men can advertise to women who don't mind a few bucks for more pleasure than normal.
9922	Legally, yes it has happened. The infamous urban legend of Biker chicks knocking a guy down and having their way with him in a park is an example.

9923	There is a broad and accepted definition of rape, any sexual activity with an involuntary consent in an sexually intimate context, however many women insist that not every sexual activity that happens without a prior agreement from an individual is rape.
9924	legally, yes it has. The infamous urban legend of biker chick knocking a guy down and having sex with him in a park is an example, actually more like the movie chick fighting for her bike vs. street fighter, it really is your best friend or something...like i said the reality is that it's hard to have unwilling sex with a guy by definition, guys like sex, if they are not in a relationship they have very little incentive to avoid sex, even bad sex. A guy weak enough to be raped would be a laughing stock. The most likely scenario would be a date rape drug and the guy contracts an STD from it's usage, especially a married or engaged man, though it would be extremely hard for the guy to prove his unwillingness and it would take a mountain of evidence to prove such.
9925	There is some truth to the situation of being intentionally pregnant. However, the father may have a strong case against the mother because it is possible the child was conceived before the father knew her. The child does not have to be punished and the father's case may be hard to prove.
9926	I heard about this on the news this morning. IMO, he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby. Even if she says she is on birth control, or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is. On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father. On the other hand, if he went ahead with the act and she got pregnant, then that bothers me a little.
9927	Both men and women have a choice whether or not to have sex with someone and whether or not to use protection. Even if she says she is on birth control or he uses a condom, it does not matter. The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she got pregnant, he is just as responsible as her. On the other hand, if she was intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this. Aside from that, I don't think it matters if a man came into a place he shouldn't go because the place didn't tell him to. If the place did not warn him he could get in trouble. However, if you took a bath at a public pool you should know that the water is potentially contaminated and so if you dipped into the water you could get sick. Aside from that, I don't think it's the father's fault that the baby got born.
9928	On the other hand, if he intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. If she accidentally got pregnant, and he went ahead with the act, then he is just as responsible as she is.
9929	I heard about this on the news this morning, and I'm of the opinion that he had a choice whether or not to perform the act that resulted in the baby.

So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.

9930	There is nothing on the planet that is more binding than that of the Triple Dog Dare. Example:  Thong Wearing Men Arrested at Wal-Mart  Thursday, July 29, 10:59 AM EST AP  SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a "triple-dog dare," authorities said.  The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said.  Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car.  Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct.  When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend "triple-dog dared" them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.

9937	If you need more proof that terrorism is the most important issue to my mind, read this thing I've read today. Here is a meme that gathers up a lot of the claims made by those who would put terrorism in their lives.{What is an “insider?”  These are often people who are told they are important but then can’t show up when they’re supposed to.  If they can’t go to work and be productive, what are they supposed to do? If they can’t look out for their loved ones, what are they supposed to do?
9938	It is important, it can help. But is it necessary? Most semi truck drivers carry insurance and yes some of them carry multi million dollar insurance.

9940	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues of Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay is an excellent example of why the press exaggerates issues. While the prisoners were humiliated, they weren't tortured. The UN used the accusation to bash the USA, which resulted in deaths in detention. Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture. So, if you feed them, it's torture, but if you don't and they starve, it's torture. Lastly, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power that they can use while incarcerated.

9942	As for the Guantanamo Bay scandal, the prisoners were humiliated and there was no evidence of torture. It was a political issue because now the UN was using the charges against the US.  Additionally, force feeding prisoners while on hunger strike was torture and I would say that the current legal system and definition of torture has not changed in the last sixty years. If prisoners continue to lie to UN officials about the treatment they received, it would be because they don't like the current system and want something to change it.
9943	If you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The UN exaggerates the issues.  Be skeptical of accusations. Guantanamo was an excellent example. The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US. The UN makes loopholes that allow the US to stay in charge. Guantanamo is operating in violation of international law. Force feeding prisoners is torture.  If you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's torture. The UN gives a fake solution to a violation of international law.

9945	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.

9950	The problem with the main controversy is that it comes down to whether the fetus has a brain or not.  To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.  So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.  This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.
9951	The main question centers around whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.  To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.  So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.  This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.
9952	Here is how i see the main controversy around abortion. To solve this we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by the presence of a person as shown by brain activity.  So if a fetus doesn't show signs of brain activity, then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.  This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially making the abortion issue a lot easier to solve.
9953	Fetal test is the best way to handle abortion cases in my opinion. Using the other method in countries with religious ban on abortion we can't handle those cases by using gestational age and the estimated date of delivery since we can go long periods before a fetus has brain activity. And even in the case where you can use gestational age and estimated date of delivery we can't do mass abortions since its unethical. And even if there is no ethical objection, mass abortions are subject to legal penalties of aborting unwanted children.

9955	I would say that suicide is a stupid thing to do when you know how capable you are to live. Suicide isnt an option i find necessary and that a person who commit suicide are not stupid so i change my view over this topic as i am open to all responses from you all.
9956	If a person is willful enough to consider or even act on suicide, they have the strength to live on. This doesnt make any sense, why would anyone want to commit suicide. I'm not sayin suicides ok, but like its stupid to do such a thing when you have the strength to live on. So, for this topic, i changed it to "If you have the strength to kill yourself, you have the strength to live on". Change my view over this topic as I am open to all responses from you all.
9957	If a person is willful enough, they have the strength to consider or even act on the idea of suicide, then they should have the strength to continue living, because if they commit suicide, it only means that they are stupid, and that they are the real killers, not the ones who commit it. I'm open to all responses from you all.
9958	If people could commit suicide, they could continue living. It is not in their best interest to put themselves at risk, however. It truly doesnt make any sense why a person would rather take their own life over living. Suicide is a very serious matter, so put off your immature opinions. Instead, share any and all differing views you may have regarding the importance of living.
9959	Because if someone has the strength to kill themselves, then they must be capable of living on, right?
9960	Some people may be bored of school because their classes aren't challenging them. Not every school has advanced classes, and I know that my HS only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having students fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better chance of comprehending what's going on. The students who excel in their class may go to a higher class so they don't get bored with the curriculum. I don't mean that students should be placed in different grades. I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to take an easier class.

I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.
9962	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either. I know my HS only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on.

I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.
9963	Some students may feel bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged by the material or the curriculum. Not every school has advanced classes and I know my high school has only been able to place me in 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they should take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may need to be put in a higher level class to ensure they do not get bored with the curriculum.

So those students that aren't as bright or good at school could get more out of the classes they are put in.
9965	While most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society, and good acts are often beneficial to self and society, they're still amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are a purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which doesn't prove a greater objective moral truth.
9966	not right or wrong. Our notions of right and wrong are purely a result of chemistry in our brain, which in no way proves a greater moral truth. The facts and consequences of the actions that lead up to the thoughts in our minds are what I consider more important. The morals are what should matter, but there isn't a moral that can apply to every possible situation, and so morals are irrelevant.
9967	Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.       So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.     This makes sense. I was not trying to imply that right and wrong have no value in themselves.      But that they have no value for the dictates of social morals. After all, how do the amoralists feel about beating each other up in urban areas if they are certain the acts will not harm anyone? How do they feel about bringing to America businessmen that will certainly violate American law when they agree to do business with them because they feel they won't hurt anyone? How do they feel about selling pirated copies of the same albums which they had money for? How do they feel about selling guns to 17-year-olds, to adults over 21, even to those who don't want to own them if they can guarantee they won't hurt anyone?     There are countless ways to commit murder or rape and not hurt anyone, though not enough to change my mind. That is just the way of the world, and those are the means by which people interact with one another. It doesn't exist a great moral objective truth except for avoid feeling pain, and that's what every human being is after anyway. I think it's stupid to claim 'you should have sex without protection if you're in love, and if you are not in love, you shouldn't have sex at all.'". If one is or is not in love is not what one should care about. It's never your obligation to be in love with someone unless it's mutually desired. Everything just works as it should do, as natural phenomena seem to do. Therefore, the issue of morality does not exist; there is no objective moral truth. We only care about our
9968	Concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years. Since we don't have absolute moral truths, it's illogical to promote morality and vice through logical reasoning. You should promote morality and vice based on your religious values and standards, not based on logic and reason. The ability to rationalize, always be logical, and never judge the existence of everything based on the exact facts, is inherent to all humans and makes us all unreliable. It also makes us less moral because we can be manipulated to the point of denying the core things we consider moral and true. I've decided to only respond to a few of the comments and provide the text that I felt was the most appropriate to your point of view and clarified where I thought I needed to. Thanks.
9969	Right and wrong are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true good and evil don't exist.       Not that I advocate rampant immorality or anything, that'd be stupid. Most acts we generally consider immoral are detrimental to society -murder, theft, rape, etc- all of these things may not be intrinsically evil, but they're not beneficial to one doing them or society in general.       So while most evil acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and good acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral. Our senses of right and wrong are purely a result of chemicals in our brain provoking feeling, which in no way proves a greater objective moral truth.         Right and wrong are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true good and evil don't exist.       I see that concepts of right and evil are man made and subjective, changing with society throughout the years, and because of this there are no objective morals and true good and evil don't exist.       However, morality is an inherently subjective one, which suggests that there isn't a set of parameters, standards, or parameters that a judge (or person) applies consistently based on external factors.          My intention here isn't to imply that morals cannot be an objective fact, to prove that they can't.  It takes enormous consistency to apply a system that has so many degrees of grey and so many external factors in play to apply such a system universally consistently.         The point of this entire argument is that all morals are inherently subjective and its completely meaningless to apply a general opinion on a particular subject. Therefore, whilst we must ensure our morals are beneficial to ourselves and our society in general, we must not advise others on how to behave or vote (or any other areas of life), as it is not clear if morals can apply universally.
9970	If something is important enough to cover in a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section.   I think people only ever turn to FAQ pages if they can't find what they want within the main site.   When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant.   If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content.   Websites should Never include an FAQ section and I cannot find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO.   Change my view.
9971	tv is better than books because tv can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. also it's educational.
9972	Don't include an FAQ section because it doesn't enhance site user experience. Also, it doesn't add any value to the overall content, and it only complicates the organization of the content. I would only include an FAQ section when no matter where you look to solve the issue it is only found in the FAQ. Change my view.

9974	If something is important enough to cover in a website, then it should be easily found within the core content of the site and not shoved into an FAQ section. I see the point where its about information that should be available in the core copy, and that it should not go in an FAQ section. And I fully support my argument to have webmasters and SEO's write text that is relevant to the content and that is able to move visitors from the site. People only turn to FAQ pages if they are searching and cannot find what they want within the main site.

9975	There should be no argument in this, since "hyphenation" is a word that is generally used to refer to any kind of compound adjective or noun that contains a hyphen between two words. However, "hyphenation" is an uncommon word that is rarely used outside of certain contexts, and is sometimes subject to being misinterpreted in certain contexts. Additionally, some people and organizations may not want to give the term "hyphenation" the literal meaning that it has. Therefore, "hyphenation" can be used in many different ways. Using "hyphenation" in certain contexts is probably not all that different from using "hyphen", "rhyphen", "hyphenette", and "hyphener". So I think there is no reason to attribute the meaning of "hyphenation" to a specific way that people have used the word "hyphenation" in the past.
9976	Even if it is shunned by everyone to use the word. It becomes something that only one race can use and that is racist. If I am being to vague on why I have my opinion, feel free to ask me questions. I am interested in a debate about why my opinion that using the word is wrong, and not about how implementing a censorship would work.
9977	It means that a word or phrase that one race can use but another race can't. That is a given concept. But it is also true that no one can *censor* a word without the support of the majority of that society.
9978	Finding merit to the criticism that the word "demon" is mostly or entirely exclusive to people of one color is difficult. The persecution of the word, and thus its association with one people, was the primary motivation for my premise. I am aware that censorship is related to my question, but I want to know the why of my opinion that using the word is wrong and not about how implementing a censorship would work.
9979	No one shuns the word because no one uses it unless it is for racism.
9980	As far as I know, acting cinema can only be heard during the shooting, and even then it won't be strong enough to be heard in the theater. I could understand it is a special screening or premiere or there is an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience, but in normal movie-going, I don't think that it is necessary for people to clap.
9981	It would be unusual to understand that a movie that you see on your computer screen is better than a movie that you see on the big screen, because the big screen will provide the sound of the soundtrack as well.
9982	When the movie is over people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as there isn't a reason why the film people who have a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it doesn't make any sense to me. Please modify my opinion so I can stop getting upset when people clap.
9983	In my opinion, clapping during a film does not make much sense. Someone has created the film and left the audience alone. We should be applauding on screen actors.
9984	When the film finishes, people in the audience clap to show appreciation for the performance. However, it doesn't make any sense to clap for a normal movie-going experience because no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand it if it was a special screening, premiere, or an actor from the film was in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Please modify my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.
9985	Not only this but anything "genetic" to that person is more to do with an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics.  "Give me a child until theyre 7 and i will give you the man"  The world is one big chaotic system. Literally EVERY SINGLE choice you make, even subconscious ones come together to create your destiny so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.

"Give me a child until they are 7 and I will give you the man." The world is one big chaotic system. Literally everything we do, even subconscious ones, come together to create our destiny. The choices we do as adults are a product of how the world treats us as children and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make, which may seem meaningless and repetitive. We take those patterns and continue them with our choices as an adult with the belief that they are real choices but they aren't because it is the same cycle. We make choices based on our distorted perception of the world around us. The fact that their is no way to escape is also another part of this cycle and one we aren't ever able to escape.  "Be wary of peoples zealots  if your brain failed to prevent you from slaughtering 6 million people in ww2 then it probably wont be able to prevent you from listening to stuff like this"  Yes, the decision is yours. But when a child is acting in the way a mental health professional advised in their professional opinion they are basically killing themselves. Sure there are

All the choices you make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
9990	Point 1 - testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly. Testing is a good thing because it can show the effectiveness of school programs. It is required by parents, district leaders, parents of students, students, teachers, superintendents and chancellors because it’s the only available measure of how well a school is doing in comparison to their peers. Education changes over time and requires ever changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Curriculum is developed by teachers to fit their course, the students in their class and how they think they can best teach them. Learning involves students. Education involves teachers and parents. The state and teachers are partners in providing the kind of education that each student will need in order to lead a productive life. High performing teachers should be paid more so that they can be effective in leading the classroom. Testing improves student’s understanding of subject matter because it tests knowledge they learned. High test scores have important practical benefits, including giving students access to college and helping the state better identify students who are best served by learning a particular subject. There is nothing wrong with standardized testing prior to each school year. It’s just that standardized tests have been overused and politicized to a level that it can no longer be considered a reliable measure
9991	Point 1 - monitoring or evaluating a system is necessary. Point 2 - education changes over time. Point 3 - teachers must continue to be learning new methods and changing curriculum in order to be effective. Point 4 - standardized testing prior to each school year would allow teachers to be moved where most effective or removed all together if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process. Point 5 - high performing teachers could be paid more.
9992	Testing is the only effective means of objective measurement and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly.
9993	Point 1 - standardized testing is the only effective means of objective measurement, and is necessary to evaluate if a system is working properly.  Point 2 - the education changes over time, and requires a constantly changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life.  Point 3 - teachers must continue to learn these new methods and changing curriculum in order to effectively lead the learning process.  Point 4 - standardized testing, prior to each school year, would allow teachers to be moved where most effective, or removed from the classroom if they are no longer effective at leading the learning process.  Point 5 - high-performing teachers could be paid more if the underperforming teachers were removed from the labor pool.
9994	The only objective way of measuring is testing, and education requires constantly changing curriculum and methods in order to prepare students for modern life. Teachers must keep learning new methods and changing curriculum, and schools must have the ability to evaluate which methods are best and train teachers to lead learning, teaching them these methods. To be effective teachers must be able to change course and adapt to changing education methods in order to optimize learning for their students. In modern society, teachers are trained and evaluated on how effectively they are able to teach each individual student and how well each child responds to the different learning methods. Teachers, if they do not respond well to change, are not kept in the system, and the process stops there, and that would need to be fixed.
9995	My point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
9996	Unfortunately, we don't know life on any other planet, so there is no way to estimate how common life in the entire universe is.
9997	If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy.   Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life.  But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe?  It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars.  It would look the same.  E: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
9998	my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
9999	There is no statistical evidence that life exists elsewhere.  There is no statistical evidence that life exists on Earth.  It only makes sense to speculate that life exists elsewhere when there is evidence from biology that life does. There is no statistical evidence for the existence of life elsewhere so how do we make this a great argument to consider this amazing fact as real?  Which in short means, we have no empirical evidence that life exists elsewhere.  Where do we fit in on that point then?  I don't know.
10000	* Hamas has fired some 2000 missiles into Israel over the past 2 weeks despite numerous attempts by Israel to cease-fire without retaliation.  * Hamas declining/ignoring these opportunities of peace have left Israel with no options besides retaliation. With the main goal of Hamas being to destroy Israel; Israel has the right to neutralize Hamas to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens.  * Israel should not be held accountable for civilian casualties in Gaza when Hamas is actively trying to increase civilian casualties by firing missiles out of civilian buildings.  * I believe the disregard for civilian casualties by Hamas and continual bombing of Israel is enough justification to invade Gaza and prevent further bombings.
10001	Even with Hamas firing only 2000 missiles over the last two weeks, they still could have killed thousands. However, in order for Israeli civilians to be safe and less tonnage of shrapnel to be expended, Israel retaliated. This allowed Israel to not put civilians in danger and effectively cut the flow of munitions to Hamas. I believe that is enough justification for Israel to invade Gaza.

10005	Since your building does not have an elevator (your apartment is at the 3rd floor), you keep your bike secured outside. About 3 weeks ago your bike got stolen. You bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. You are very pissed now. There's no way you are throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. You also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously theft, no way you are financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting stealing bikes on your own. Why should you not do that? Please throw in a better alternative.
10006	If you feel that your bike needs an elevator to get to your apartment, buying a new one will not help. Also be aware that a stolen bike looks cheap because it was stolen, no matter how cheap it is. The only way that you can distinguish a stolen bike is if it's made in China. Also, I hate paying for stolen goods no matter what. I can't distinguish if a bike has been stolen or not. If I see a bike that looks good, I'll pay money to steal it. It's no different from prostitution or drugs. All stolen goods are stolen. Being an thieves or drugs trafficker is not only a criminal offense, it is evil. No matter how cheap it is, the bike must be recycled or destroyed. Why should the thief have to be paid for it?
10007	Since my building does not have an elevator (my apartment is at the 3rd floor), I keep my bike locked outdoors. About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen, I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. I'm very pissed, there's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euro to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously theft, no way I'm financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting stealing bikes on my own. Why should I not do that? Also please throw in a better alternative.
10008	Since my building lacks an elevator my bike can't be secured in the basement. So I keep it outside my apartment in order to make it more secure. About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen. I bought a new one last night and it's also gone. I'm very pissed off. I don't want to spend a lot of money on buying another one at the shop. But I don't want to steal a bike either. So what should I do?
10009	Since my building is lacking an elevator (my apartment is at the 3rd floor) I keep my bike secured outdoor. About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well. I'm very pissed now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously theft, no way I'm financing those fucking cunts. I also won't steal a bike on my own because I would have to get a commercial permit. There is a gun on my property for insurance reasons but it also needs insurance because it carries at least a 25k euros law. Anyway, the past 3 weeks I had to break into other people's houses to find a real key to the apartment building. They let me because I kept bad behaviours during my shift. So I would like to make a point that since there is a gun on my property there is a 100% chance I'll make it into the city. I also wanted to see if anyone has any more solutions on this topic, I hate all those armed guards everywhere.
10010	Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are what help us save our world.
10011	Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
10012	Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation. Therefore, without them, we may as well just be annihilating ourselves.
10013	If we had our nuclear warheads we wouldn't be fighting war either. The Cold war for example. If the US and the Soviet Union didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khrushchev, etc have for NOT invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them.  Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.
10014	With how close the world has come to annihilating itself because of leaders who've been a bit trigger happy (Cuban Missile Crisis) I truly believe nukes are pretty much the only reason the world isn't in major conflict right now.  The Cold War for example. If the US and the Soviets hadn't had their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khrushchev, etc have for not invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them.   Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other. 
10015	Observe women in the street and you will see that some of them cover themselves with burqas (or kurtas or niqabs). This kind of clothing is meant for religious purposes: it is to allow the Muslim women to pray in privacy and to keep out the view of men who might become sexually aroused.
10016	TV shows and pornography are better because only TV shows and pornography can bring you live news, you cannot find this kind of information in books, and it also has an educational effect. I often see discussions about the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing to cover the Muslim women, but nobody seems to realize that the west does the same thing with breasts.  In most places, women must cover up their breast in public and face, if they cover up their face, they can't express themselves freely, and websites will hide images/videos that are deemed nude. Breasts are sexually exploited and are banned from public display, how is this different from covering up women's faces or legs? We have also sexualized breast, how is this different from religious dressing?  I invite you all to connect and mingle.
10017	Criticizing the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women is more invalid, while criticizing exposing breasts publicly in the west is all too common. We don't have the same sexualization of breasts as our neighbors to the north, but we do have the sexualization of women.
10018	Criticise wearing burqas or other clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. Read countless online discussions and watch a lot of television debates/news programs that critique the use of burqas within Islam. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.  In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?  I invite you all to censure everyone and everything that crosses your face.
10019	Criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women are completely irrelevant. It is totally normal to criticize the use of burqas in a western environment where face revealing clothes are illegal and even proscribed as similar to sex. The principles the west applies to breasts is mirrored throughout the Muslim culture with regards to breast cover, and why we criticize this? That is irrelevant.
10020	Is CMV associated with the Republican party? How is it similar to "White House" or "Lady Gaga"?
10021	Throughout the debate with the Washington Redskins I keep hearing the argument that a team named the Washington Redskins is the equivalent of having a team named the Detroit N*****s.  This to me is illogical: First off when has anyone ever heard the word Redskin outside of talking about the professional football team? Has anyone used the word Redskin out of hate? I am not sure as to whether or not it is a racist term but I am going to assume it is. However, Redskin is not similar at all to using the N word just simply on how the word is used in context.   CMV

10025	To people that dont know a great deal about it, it is seen as being like a hooliganism and associated with being immature and has generally bad connotations if you ask the average joe. Some would not even consider it a sport. But I consider it a form of street art, on the basis that it is fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style; an artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in; it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative. If you're more in favor of a corporations right to take up public space with art than you are in favor to peoples desire to rebel against that with street art then I'm not expecting to change your mind with this and you wont change mine by saying it's against the law but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.
10026	There is definitely some art that is made by people who know nothing about it. I would be surprised if that wasn't true. There is some street art. People who don't know anything about skateboarding would be surprised if that weren't true, too. I think that for people who know little about street art and skateboarding, they would be somewhat surprised by it because they might assume that it is a form of hooliganism or something, associated with being immature and generally very bad connotations. From what I've read about skateboarding, I don't think it has a bad connotation because in many ways skateboarding is a form of art that has a strong theme of rebellion and breaking the rules, in a lot of ways I consider street art to be similar to skateboarding if you look at it in terms of the art. So it might make people, particularly people who think a lot about things like the practical applications of things, and skeptical if they don't really know a lot about skateboarding or street art. So if you do or don't support it and whatnot you can really say whatever you want about it and I'll understand and agree with you, but I'd be surprised if street art or skateboarding didn't have some sort of bad connotation attached to it in the minds of people who don't know a lot about it and don't really appreciate it because it's a form of street art. There is an art form called graffiti and what people do is they write elaborate, elaborate texts that are elaborate in terms of the language that they use, and the artwork that they do, but I think street art is more freedom in that the artwork doesn't have to be necessarily based off of any sort of specific, specifically delineated style and that definitely gets a lot of people a little concerned, which is understandable and it's fine as long as you understand that. I do understand it in this way because a lot of people do want to have some sort
10027	People who do not know anything about it seem to be slightly disdainful towards it, and it is seen as being like a form of hooliganism and associated with being immature.  Some would even consider it a sport.  But I consider it a form of street art, because it is  * fundamentally creative, everyone has their own style  * a sort of artistic rebellion against the mundane, boring cityscape a lot of people are born in, it takes what to someone else is just a ledge and turns it into something fun and creative  if you're more in favor of a corporation's right to take up public space with art than you are in favor to peoples desire to rebel against that with street art, then fair enough I do not expect to change your mind with this and you won't change mine by saying it's against the law but if you enjoy street art you should appreciate skateboarding on some level.

10030	Professional soccer players playing up a slight bump by a member of the opposing team is unsportsmanlike and gives a poor image to the sport overall. It seems as though the player who was one moment ago crying out in agony is nearly always up running around after the other guy receives a yellow card (presumably because the first guy just received an almost death blow). If you look at football, basketball, etc., the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game. Of course I'm not saying that legitimate injuries don't occur, or that fouls shouldn't be punished. I'm simply saying that soccer is full of faking, and it pisses me off. Change my view.
10031	Legit injuries do occur and fouls need to be punished. But I see it as soccer is full of fakers.
10032	To say that professional soccer players behave as little adults when going up to people playing a trivial game is untrue and unsportsmanlike. They show play by rule and are respectful and polite to everyone involved.   Of course, I'm not saying that you shouldn't get hit by something unsportsmanlike. I'm simply saying that soccer has a lot of fakers and that it pisses me off. Change my view.
10033	Professional soccer players should behave more like true sports men and women when there is a slight bump and not agitate the crowd with false crying or glare back at the offender in the bitter eye of their injured teammate. If you look at other sports like football, basketball, etc. the players always brush off the bump and go right back into the game.
10034	Professional soccer players jumping up when they are poked by the opposition is unprofessional behavior and it gives a poor image to the sport. It’s like the victim who’s been thumped by the opponent, is getting emotional a minute later when the victim gets the yellow card and he or she drops back into the game. Football, basketball, etc, players always brush off the bump and continue with the game. Oh, and if anyone was to suggest that fouls should not be punished, I would challenge that idea to show that they existed in lower social echelons, like in the schoolyard.
10035	I think women are only good for sex. Maybe I should have changed the title 'CMV: I think women are only good for sex'. Thanks again.
10036	Women are like flowers, they only should be treated as a valuable object, not of use, so that you should not bother telling them. A woman can still have a good life, even if she is not beautiful, but since we have always been told women are only there to love and not for sexual purposes, there have always been certain few to lead such lives. Believe me I know this, I'm a woman. I don't agree with the way women have treated since we were born, but I choose to not make many changes to the world, rather than to change myself. By wearing these clothes I have chosen to do the same thing you all are doing but try harder to convince some educated women that we have the same rights.
10037	Thanks all. The problem lies with me. I think women are only good for sex. Maybe I should have changed the title of the thread. Thanks again.
10038	Women are not good for sex. Instead of that it's dangerous. A woman can be so cold and would never remember someone's birthday, so one never knows what she is thinking. What about personal feelings? Not always she'll be in a good mood and reply at the first opportunity. A man can smile and hug her and a woman will react very differently and is afraid of being hurt so she holds back. So one can feel that for no reason she has to be always in a strong position. It can be very dangerous. There are much better things to do. Work, study, have hobbies, etc. Women are often good in their jobs, think they have never met a dull woman, but what about in real life? So I think it's not a good thing to be close to a woman who wants to be free, not take things seriously or avoid gossip and social events. One doesn't wanna put the top in her shirts, which I consider okay, but maybe be careful with her tote bags, too. Perhaps, she should not be constantly wearing low cut, but too revealing clothes. In my opinion, it's much better to be cool than hot. Hot means you don't have any standards and are afraid to be hated. Be confident, enjoy life and be really generous. That's a better way to live and not just a woman. Why tell yourself all the time that you are a nice guy or a good girl? One wouldn't have to fake it. A person always knows himself. What are good, what are bad. Women as a whole don't deserve respect, and we should not spend time talking about them. Women are animals first and do not deserve respect. Memos should be printed out and saved when one gets raped or almost raped. That will help you find a place to hide. Women should not dress sexy, but conservative. They should not be scared of rape, but they do. One does not have to work at home, but one can do it, also one can earn money, also one can have
10039	When you look at the world like that, I don't think you can have a good viewpoint on this topic. I hope you will change your mind, because it's obvious that you do.
10040	Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say, "Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil." I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. Yea sure the media and the Education system are plagued with wrongheadedness but that is a seperate issue. I do think that the current perception of evil that we have is driven by the mass media, ignorance, and products such as water bottles that value people over the environment. The people that we define as evil may not think that they are evil. The media and teachers paint them as evil in order for us to grasp how important and relative it is to be good people and the power that they have. People don't do good unless it is beneficial to themselves or that they feel it right or that it is due. People don't seek out to be evil, they seek out to do right and be good which may not always

10042	Generally speaking, people that the USA considers bad, my mind trends toward Vladimir Putin, Osama bin Laden and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas.

When I think of people that are against capitalism and western ideas, my mind trends toward Vladimir Putin, Osama bin Laden and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. My parents never told me I was bad when I was younger, because I did good things, however my parents went to an Illinois Catholic school, and in particular, some of the other boys there did bad things. Maybe they were evil, but the point is that I didn't know I was evil.   Thanks again  A:  First, you need to figure out what the original intent was. To my ear, the typical theme of this article was something like: "This country is so damn racist and why haven't we responded in the form of deporting illegal aliens." But if you read the full article, the second half at least

10055	American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their child's public education and ER visits. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say it all - illegal. We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship 'those who are born here = automatic citizens.'

10060	Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried Peaches is never on TV except in a movie called "Peaches!" Luke Wilson's Dead Poets Society suicide scene in Riverworld is funnier than Owen Wilson's "Bananacool!" in Bottle Rocket. The funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson film (minus In the Future You Look Like a Banana) is the tennis scene.
10061	Even after decades of learning to let go of the oncoming emotions, Luke Wilson still has a ton of pain left in his body and speech, and this scene took over 10 years to build up to.
10062	no no no no even Wes's worst acting is better than Ryan Reynold's worst, okay maybe Ryan Reynolds has Michael Bay's worst moment in I am tradesman or even than Gregg Hanna's/winslow's in dead pool but our Wes would fare better than these actors.
10063	The speech, dead drops, and Kentucky Fried Chicken accent in "Owen Wilson" is just... hilarious. And the worst 15 seconds of any of his movies (excluding Future Man) is the tennis scene.
10064	No Needler in the Hay is not necessarily the funniest movie of all time, but it ranks among the funniest scenes in any movie. That final line just strikes me funny.
10065	While I understand completely there is more respect for a married couple who truely learn life's true beauties (trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another human being), I believe there is more respect for a single person who truely learns life's true beauties (solitary adventure, freedom to live life on your own terms without consequences, freedom to allow your personality to express itself
10066	When marrying someone is the right decision you will be happier and earn the respect from your family and friends. And will live a happier and better life. In case you haven't figured it out, everything else is but a side effect of the right decision.
10067	By the first person, married life= everything in place, stability for the rest of your life, a partner whom loves and adores you so much as to make a lifetime commitment to you, respect from family and friends, and the happiest. Single Life= lonely, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance!
10068	As for the characters "the married life" and "the single life", I've added emphasis and highlighted the words I believe have been misinterpreted. As for the rest, I've changed the words up to convey the same message without the extensive commentary.
10069	There is more respect for a married couple who completely learns true beauties such as trust, mutual respect, lifelong commitment to another person. While I understand how the single life can be lonely and a lack of maturity.
10070	In a shotgun there is the requirement to be loaded and ready to fire. A chainsaw is continuously running, so I would go down the block while spinning in circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. However if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun would have the advantage of distance.
10071	Zombies would need to be shot and running a chainsaw is continuous. I would start by cleaning up my gun by loading it up with some rocks, nails and batteries. Then I would cover the affected area with wet floors and liquids until the zombies stop running after their eyes starts dimming. That's when I hit them.
10072	As long as you have a loaded chainsaw and can spin as a circular motion of undead carnage (although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
10073	Chainsaws are better than shotguns. a chainsaw is a continuous moving thing you can do continuous work. a shotgun needs to be loaded and fired.
10074	If you wanted to kill zombies with a chainsaw then you would have to keep it on constantly because even if the zombies were packed it would have to work to keep hitting them in the head continuously. On the other hand, a shotgun would only need to be loaded and fired.
10075	If humans had a moral responsibility to moderate our impact on the natural world, then perhaps we'd have to limit what we eat, what materials we use, how much we consume, how we degrade our environment and what we do with our waste. If so, does that mean we are so morally corrupt that we can't keep ourselves alive? So the worse the environment gets, the worse we have to "act"? If so, we must be "pro-life" on issues that don't justify our dire economic plight
10076	It is reasonable to hold certain things to be true, even if it entails the absurd. For example, it's reasonable to believe in evolution, even if it entails the absurd.
10077	In fairness, belief in evolution implies a necessary belief in extinction-it's not the pretty part, but it's a part of the package. And while humans have a moral responsibility to moderate their impact on the natural world, we're doing more right now than any species ever has before. Would it be enough if it offset our impact -which is hardly natural- or are we supposed to save every last species, however unfit?

10080	When it comes to Pink Floyd, it's pretty difficult to say who is better at symphonic metal. I personally think they're both great.
10081	There is no hard and fast rule for this one and it depends on the type of song and the band. Some songs sound good for headphones and some not so much. But I would say that if you can hear the music more clearly and understand the lyrics better, then you are listening better with headphones
10082	It depends what you listen to. But for the sake of argument (which is why we are here right?), I will use the example of Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon. TBH, and I know I am going to get cruxified for this, I have to say that when I listen to it just with speakers on it really sounds pretty thin and uneasy. Whereas, when I put the headphones I am really seeing the whole vision and scope of walters phycadelic epic. But hey, like I said, it sort of depends on the album I guess!
10083	Although what I think is just as much of a testament to Pink Floyd as it is to the album is how intense the sounds become as soon as I turn up the headphones. Whereas, when I listen to it just with speakers on it really sounds pretty thin and uneasy. Whereas, when I put the headphones I am really seeing the whole vision and scope of walters phycadelic epic. But hey like I said, it sort of depends on the album I guess!

10085	Yes we captured bin Laden, but removing him from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even islamic ones in Indonesia would not be impressed by the death of a single man.
10086	Removing bin Laden from the planet is not going to do much or anything to stop terrorism. Terrorists, even if they are islamic and are located in Indonesia, wouldn't be impressed by the death of a single man.
10087	As time goes by and when you finally do not fear a nuclear war that could kill millions, maybe you will be willing to surrender someone who did not help you eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but who helped you terrorize and kill scores of innocent people. Even non muslim terrorists wouldn't be impressed by the death of one man.
10088	Capturing or killing Osama bin Laden would be a great accomplishment. However, removing bin Laden from the planet would do little or nothing to stop terrorism. Terrorists would likely not be impressed by the death of a single man.
10089	There are better ways to stop terrorism other than killing Bin Laden.
10090	Depends on the genre... For FPS, RTS, MMORPGs, and racing games I prefer PC Gaming because I'm way more accurate with a mouse and keyboard than a controller and my PC's steering wheel plus gadgets make the racing games much more fun than a controller does. Pretty much every other genre however seems to benefit from the console controllers, side-scrollers, action RPGs, RPGs, sports, etc etc etc.

10095	On a legal basis, the death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment. Rebellion is a term with many definitions but revenge is revenge. The U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders, but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced and once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends. Not enough research has been made to conclude the deterrence effect.
10096	In point of view, the death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment, which states "No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." It also conflicts with the idea of equality, since the sentence of death is disproportionate to the crime. The punishment serves as retribution for crimes that haven’t been punished in a court of law. The U.S. has executed a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made. Yet none of them have been allowed to come back and seek justice.
10097	The death penalty contradicts Eighth Amendment rights because it does not provide a consistent due process of law. In the United States, there has been a slight but positive increase in the number of people being executed, but this has also been helped along by the legal system of the United States. If a mistake has been made, the error has been ignored. Those on death row are not the worst offenders but simply the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves. It is a system that is unbalanced. Once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Asking the United States if they think they should reinstate the death penalty after 131 innocent prisoners have been released is a wasted question. The United States has conducted so little research on the deterrence effect.
10098	As for the death penalty, it is part of the constitutional right to life and should not be taken away without a careful consideration, especially in the event of an unnecessary and brutal execution. But the extent to which it is applied is too often based on one aspect of the law, instead of the complete legal system. Also, revenge is something to be avoided to keep a peaceful society. Furthermore, to execute criminals is inefficient and contrary to the rights of any innocent victim. Besides, an unsuccessful attempt to overturn a death sentence is an admission of failure in the criminal legal system. As for the cases of the innocent individuals being sent to the electric chair, it is too often the result of a failed execution attempt. There is evidence showing that in some cases innocent people are wrongfully convicted.
10099	Dialogue: Why don't you give the man a shot in the head?
10100	Within the UK, there is currently a problem with integration. Both the Christian's and the Muslims are using the debate to promote their side of the story. This is why the Archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within the UK there would be nothing keeping Christianity from running a parallel law system. It's the classic situation that many parents face, you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in the UK, which is both illegal and totally unneccesary. If a Muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country where Sharia law is the primary law system.
10101	The Christian and Muslim integration within Britain is currently a problem. Both sides of the arguement are using this debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country.

10102	One of the major problems with Islam in Britain is that both the Christians and the Muslims are using the debate as a way to unite more religious power within the country. This is why the Archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once Islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within Britain there would be nothing keeping Christianity from running a parallel law system. It's the classic situation that many parents face, you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britain, which is both illegal and totally unnecessary. If a Muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country that has it as their primary law system.
10103	The integration of muslims is currently a problem. Both sides of the argument are using the integration to strengthen their religious power and they don't want the other side getting the upper hand. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within Britain, there would be nothing keeping Christianity from running a parallel law system. Its the classic situation that many parents face; you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britain, which is both illegal and not necessary. If a Muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law he can move to a country with it as their primary law system.

10105	cats because they are independent, they don't have to take them everywhere you go, and you don't have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't do it on their own.  cats are amazing animals and pets.  they aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference.  cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell out like dogs do. with cats there is no cleaning up the yard, no loud ass barks in the middle of the night, no puppies pissing all over the floor, no dog poo all over your car, no dogs licking your feet, no slobbering on your clothes, no puppies poking their nose into every possible odd situation imaginable.  they don't play fetch so you can't have those priceless memories, and you never have to clean up their shit.  cats are amazing animals and pets.  they aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference.  with cats there is no cleaning up the yard, no loud ass barks in the middle of the night, no puppies pissing all over the floor, no dog poo all over your car, no dogs licking your feet, no slobbering on your clothes, no puppies poking their nose into every possible odd situation imaginable.  they don't play fetch so you can't have those priceless memories, and you never have to clean up their shit.  cats are amazing animals and pets.  they aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference.  cats make you work
10106	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
10107	On television shows, we can learn how to read, how to write, and how to do anything else that an old fashioned TV show gives you, without the hassles. In books, you can't learn how to do that, which means that, if you want to learn how to do something, you have to read up on it. There are a lot of things I wouldn't learn from TV because television shows are the way to go nowadays, unlike books.
10108	Although cats can be Independent, I don't think it is true for all cats, but definitely some as well. It could happen to one of the dogs that are on my list but rarely happens, and not everyday, sometimes! For example, one of my cats goes out by herself sometimes but not often! Cats make you work for their affection, like the dogs do, but for cats it is a natural instinct, not a man-made product like dogs! Cats are lovely and unconditional. Dogs are loyal and loyal to their owners. But because of the way dogs are bred, people love dogs more because they are not like cats. Cats don't have the same sh$t, you know, all sh$t! They are as timid as possible. Cats are more in tune with their owners than dogs. Cats are handsome creatures! Dogs are things.
10109	Given all of the problems with cats, I think we can safely conclude dogs are the best pets for children. We have more control and can afford a professional vet to look after our dog. A cat cannot always be checked regularly by a professional vet to make sure they are good to go. This would almost certainly rule out cats as pets. I just feel that in terms of their overall contribution to our lives, cats are much better pets.
10110	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert causing damage to most of the helicopters attempting rescue of the US hostages held at the US Embassy in Iran, not due to poor planning or inadequacies by the military or the administration. Naturally Carter would've easily won re-election and Ray Gun would not have been elected. Since 1980, 20 of the 32 years have been republican presidencies and since 1968, 28 of the 44 years have been with a republican president.

10112	Operation Eagle Claw failed due to adverse weather conditions in the desert. There were Hurricane katrina on the day of the raid, and the president, Bill Clinton, had nuclear weapons on his home territory. Had he only left the site 30 minutes later, you would not have seen the television announcements of the hostages being shot down. Today there is 10 times as much nuclear material on our home territory, but we have not seen a single television reporting about it. The entire world knows that President Clinton and others knew that there were families inside the embassy being held hostage. Not a single word of the ploy has been heard on television. This speaks volumes about the leader of a nation's mentality. Very few people truly believe they were shooting civilians at an institution like a school.
10113	Despite the failure of Operation Eagle Claw to rescue the US hostages at the US Embassy in Iran, there is no evidence that Carter would've lost the election. During the time Carter had his two term, there were 7 republican president. However, since 1980, there have been 20 republican presidents, and since 1968, there have been 28 republican presidents.

10115	In the end, the author did not specify a reason to declare ASSANI anyone as a dictator. Most countries have their own set of criteria to make out whether a dictator is legit or not. So, the author should give a reasonable reason in the next version of the essay.
10116	This is not a blanket assertion. We have legitimate reasons to dictate over others. These reasons could be, to have law and order and keep us all safe, to deter aggressive acts or to police ourselves. However, we do not have the right to permanently eliminate someone merely because we think he/she is a dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees that a nation's leader is a dictator, why destroy him/her? There have been “benign” dictators just as there have been “evil” dictators.
10117	There have been "benign" dictators, just as their have been evil non-dictators.
10118	"This is way too much of a blanket assertion. Just being a 'dictator' is no reason to dispose of, much less permanently eliminate a so called dictator. Who determines who is a dictator? Assuming the world agrees a nation's leader is a dictator, why accuse the one merely because the world views a nation's leader as a dictator? There have been "benign" dictators just as their has been evil non-dictators.
10119	the statement that only dictators get to exercise power for life, I think is just a very big blanket assertic I wrote a list here (some people commented on it and tagged me on it, and I've noticed that there's been a very significant uptick in people who visited this). The idea, this is meant to be a collection of moderately classy, but alluring, listicles, by purely inspiring shitposts from my everyday to my everyday lately... If you have time and an idea to come up with, create one, and be sure to tag me on it! All you have to do is click "Comment" and follow the direction ;) The great tip is that in 2015, many people visited this site to see how much pranks I'd failed and ended up it being quite a bit... 
10120	1984 is probably the best in the sense that it is most prophetic. I feel that 1984 is much like all the best products in the world - its form follows its purpose. I have to admit I haven't read the others on the list but can only offer this single opinion.
10121	I think 1984 could be the best in the sense that it is the most prophetic. That it's written in the past is a great benefit which was, to some degree, Orwells intention. I feel that 1984 like all the best products in the world fulfils its function beautifully, i.e. form follows function. However, I have to admit that I have not read the other three books on the list and I can consequently only offer this solitary opinion.

10125	To all those doubters, you're right no building in the history of man kind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground, it must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself because of the???? I forgot what I was saying, what did the Bush administration say again?? Thats it---they would never lie to the American public right?
10126	There is no 100% proof that those buildings were a problem. The buildings next to the towers that were known to have big gaps between the buildings and rubble in buildings are safe because they were attached to the towers. I remember the wall that fell on Christmas Day cause it was a grey, barren looking wall not like the wall of the blasted rubble. I don't think the it was caused by the blast. The floor in the stairs as well as the wall was destroyed.
10127	When a building in the history of mankind has a steel frame burn to the ground, the fire must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself. When the fire will cause large bodies of people to hit the ground, therefore the tower would collapse in both directions. The other question is--how could they have used it that way?
10128	We must also consider the gravity of the situation. The fact that there has not been a previous building in the history of man kind that has been burned down should alert the officials that something is very, very wrong.
10129	To all those doubters, you're right no building in the history of man kind has ever had a steel frame burn to the ground, it must have been that REALLY hot jet fuel. And the building next to the tower that fell, completely unattached to the tower must have imploded onto itself because of the jet fuel somehow and it exploded on top of the tower.
10130	I'm not saying a language be banned, but the Internet has made it possible for us to communicate with each other and have access to knowledge, and with a common language it would be easier to do business and understand other languages and ideas properly. The Internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other. Only we need the same language now.
10131	I'm not saying it should be English, but we should have an official language. We could do better in business, understand each other better, and communicate ideas better. The internet has given us all the ability to communicate with each other, all we need now is the same language. I'm not saying destroy other languages, but it would be nice to have an official one.
10132	I'm not saying it should be english, but there should be one official language. We would be able to do business much better, understand everyone, and communicate ideas properly.

10135	We have something against Christians here? People are voting against me, a Christian, opening my store to appeal to any clients that decide there is something they need on Christmas day. Besides, anyone here ever forget some small item while entertaining? Need some batteries for the new electronic gadgets? Want to pick up pizza for the guests? Catering for Christmas day? Of course stores should be open.

10138	Here is something we have not talked about yet and I think there should be. The yearly tradition I recall many of us have kept is the list of blessings and things we would like to receive as a Christmas present. A rainbow kid, a better job, a good husband/wife or a happy home. For some of us, children can play an important part in our list of blessings.
10139	It's best for your business to open for Christmas. Any customer, no matter their religion, is welcome and you will get more customers that way.
10140	Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:30 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent.  The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good. Will definitely go back.
10141	We went to Butterblume, because Eater Montreal recommended it, because it has a great menu and unique dishes. The place is nice and the host is an interesting one. The place is filled with white and plants, which are lovely. The menu has a lot of interesting ingredients and unique textures with every meal. We decided to share the Israeli couscous with salmon salad and also had the fish and egg tomato frittata for dessert. All were delicious! The food is unique and different and the textures and flavors are so rich. We have been eating wonderfully and even the waiters were on tip, because they tried to answer every question we had. The breakfast was more traditional and we definitely should have brought our own cups and plates but we didn\'t miss it as they have them there. The place is certainly worth a visit even if you have to wait as the waiters are very welcoming. We decided to invite the hostess (who worked there for a few weeks) and she was happy to talk to us, although the location is quite distant and walking is not really an option because it\'s near the LRT. I didn\'t really think it was an interesting place.

10145	For some reason people bring their kids to this bar even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful and the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings are crispy, battered and greasy, just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's regular booth and the kids were playing fantasy football with their dads (???) so we felt the need to split so they could sit together. So it's a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best.

10150	Seeing what I have seen in my life in San Antonio I love the place. There are a few "bad fast foods" but most are great. Hey Gordy still offers Top Ramen and I like Ted's off Chula Vista. I'm a San Antonio native. Have to say that I like how Texans love swearing and are ignorant to a great extent. Nothing like seeing that Gosh, look at that, Joe said that in a article saying that Bush and some stupid mobster killed people and yet the Tea Party supporters who support Obamcare etc are all D-words. I was in San Antonio and it sounds like only things in San Antonio suck. Things in Texas suck. I can't wait to move back in October. {[Total: 0 Average: 0/5] How about an article about the man who started Ryders in Philly and his self made million on the internet?
10151	Yeah that's true. There's no getting around it, Rudy's BBQ and that sauce are awesome. I don't think I can go out there and have brisket and serve it on a potato salad. No, baby! No, no no.
10152	Well now Im moving back to CT so Im sure Rudy's is in my pat but I'm glad I got one last taste. I'll miss you.
10153	Even though I live in Houston, Rudy's is more accessible to me because I work in Austin. I loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to San Antonio 4 years ago, and yes, we have Rudy's, but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in Austin. So I think I've been there once in a while. Went to Austin for a week at the end of July, and Low and behold, what did we drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been, so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately, my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce, too peppery for her liking. I loved every second - not so much the brisket/egg taco, but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. Oh my goodness! Delish! I've moved back to Connecticut, and sure, Rudy's is in my path, but I'm glad I got one last taste of it. I will miss you, Rudy's.
10154	Texas Southern Fried Chicken. Yes that is exactly what I am talking about. Sounds ugly, bad for you and the smell is maddening, but let me tell ya...my list has been growing and growing over the years and I won't be complaining! I always say it goes like this...salt at first then lite oil. Pop in your chicken breast for 10-30 seconds per side depending on the size of your breast and then you are ready to serve! It really is that simple and the smell! EVERYONE!!! But MONEY MAKES IT SO BAD! My list has grown much longer and my mouth gets itchy long before any of these restaurants have been open... cant wait to taste these delicacies!
10155	Visited this restaurant and was very disappointed. I ordered (6) wings and fries. The small wings / fries came in a cardboard box. The meal was over priced for the value. There is also very little room to sit and eat inside. If you are not interested in watching Fox News network, or listening to talk radio host Larry Elder, this may not be the place for you. The owner appears to be a proud black conservative and has no problem letting you know it. I would suggest black folks not support this restaurant. All skin folks are not kin folks.

10158	On second thought I thought that that would probably be a nice change of pace. The classics can help save the world and degrade a great meal.

10160	We visited this delightful restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio. The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to visit and carry on a conversation. The service was attentive and professional. We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter. The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I split everything and it was just enough. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant.

10165	My only complaint about this cafe is the obnoxiously loud rave music they often have blaring in the middle of the day. The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the staff are friendly and competent. I get that it's a bar in the evening, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?

10170	Although the food that I have here is generally excellent and delicious, I can't give it a 5 because of the hotness in the restaurant. My biggest problem is that it's so hot in the restaurant that I was sweating buckets and I'm usually the one who is always cold. I've come here at least 4 times now and it continues to be hotter. Also, the service is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes we get our food super fast and sometimes we get it super slow. Sometimes the app comes after our noodles have arrived. I don't necessarily mind that it comes after but it's weird that gyoza takes that much longer than my noodles. Everything is fresh so the overall effect is still good, but I really hope they fix the temperature soon!

10195	Don't call those people snitches or rat, because if your wife was to kill someone, I wouldnt hesitate to flex the fifth amendment. Murder is a heavy offense, but remember, when you say "I do", you're basically inviting the person you're marrying into the family. So ask yourself... would you turn in your family? If so, join the police force. If not, kudos!
10196	This is right to some extent. However, I don't agree with using the 5th amendment to evict anyone. If that woman was committing serious offenses and was actively working against her husband and her children, why would you want to turn her over to law enforcement for no reason?
10197	To marry is a sacred duty that if not met with the full force of the 5th amendment; then is deceiving or cheating on one's spouse. Marriage is supposed to be a bond/partnership. Not that I'm calling anyone who turns his or her spouse in to police a snitch or a rat, but if my wife turn out to be a murderer and kill someone I would not hesitate to act! Murder is a heavy offense but remember, when you say "I do" you're basically inviting the person you're marrying into the family. So ask yourself, would you turn in your family or children. If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! I would still divorce her crazy chick though!
10198	Relationships should be considered a partnership, not a bond. In my eyes, relationships are supposed to be a bond/partnership. Not to be confused with the official business where one person runs the business to the detriment of the other party. If a wife kills someone, I would not hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder is a heavy offense and, remember when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person you're marrying into the family.

10220	India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? Yes, they have it. But there are major countries like China and the United States that also have a very significant part of the world's wealth and have higher education levels. Moreover, there is a large number of countries that are at a very young stage of development. India should leave this to the leaders.
10221	India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? But it's controlled by the superpowers who control the world's economy. I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the potential to.
10222	India... where they have a whole class of people who are stigmatized and have a huge wealth differences. And with a language that the majority of the world can't understand and doesn't want to understand. India's education quality has nothing compared to Western education. It should leave that to the superpowers.

10225	If you have a bad father, you'll have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father, you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.
10226	In my opinion it's better to be fatherless than to have a bad father. I say this because if you have a bad father you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him.

10239	Sir Raffles is not the rightful founder because he didn't increase the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He didn't establish free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.
10240	Regardless if you assume that Raffles led the expedition or Farquhar followed along with Raffles and thus came to Singapore, Raffles would have still founded Singapore regardless of who came along. Raffles had a vision for Singapore before making his decision to visit the location of the Singapore area. It did not matter who came along because his plans for Singapore were very well thought out.
10241	It was Raffles that led the expedition. Farquhar only tagged along with Raffles. So even if Farquhar did not come, Raffles would still have found Singapore.
10242	It was Raffles that led the expedition because Farquhar only tagged along with Raffles. So even if Farquhar did not come Raffles would have still founded Singapore.

He established free trade and many people came to Singapore to trade with each other. This increased Singapore's economic growth and thus the economy of Singapore.

10255	God is abstract and has to be interpreted to be concrete. He cannot generally be seen, because he would then be in contradiction to the naturalistic perspective about the universe. And He's not the creator of mankind, although he has traditionally been viewed that way. Apes are concrete, because they can be seen, and in general it's easy to get to grips with the whole ape concept. It's funny that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an abstract concept, instead of a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say 'God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden' instead of 'I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there'?
10256	God is abstract. God does not often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them.

If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?
10257	God is abstract, so that leaves the options: ape or god. Historically though, apes are less generalised than gods and that's why they are much easier to explain to mankind.

If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?
10258	God is abstract but in a way, people get to experience him because they believe in God. And like apes, they can be seen. That fact alone shouldn't really get you excited or bothered.

10260	Created in great detail. So, even though you might disagree with the Bible on an argument, I think you are correct that the arguments are very complex.
10261	The Bible is an argument that has been in existence for centuries before you reach the Old Testament. In fact, it was developed in the first century bc.
10262	The biblical account is an argument which has been in existence much longer than your note.
10263	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history. It exists long after the time of the Old Testament.
10264	For me, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history. With the writing of the Old Testament, I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity, so the Biblical account is an argument which has been in existance much longer than your note.
10265	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed in one way or another does not make your argument stronger or more valid. In point of fact, your opponent is likely to have your very best intention of eliminating or oppress
10266	just because you think your opponent is brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger

10280	Yes, most sports do indeed bring out the finest sides of human nature. The camaraderie, teamwork, and reflexive situational calculation are worthy examples. But dropping and giving me twenty for your insolence? Really? No wonder people are saying that kids are becoming flooded with unrealistic expectations. In all seriousness, though, it's a huge part of the culture right now. Even when you order a cup of coffee, a treat, or a snack, you get the snack
10281	Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits there is greater respect for the outdoors, camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation, you get the point. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!
10282	There are many benefits to cycling aside from the health benefits. It can bring you together, improve your reflexive situational calculation, and it is educational.
10283	Yes. Besides the health benefits, there are also the greater respect for the outdoors, camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation. Now drop the 20 and give me a refund.

10285	All life is not life because Raffles was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running. Here is a rewrite of the text that is more appropriate and makes only minimal changes: {Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to B
10286	General Farquhar was the one who was charged with managing the new settlement and keeping it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Governor Raffles had to return to the island of Bencoolen.
10287	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after the British presence was introduced as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10288	The colonial rule has two founders: Raffles and Farquhar. Raffles didn't do a very good job of managing the settlement, but Farquhar was the one who managed the settlement well against all odds.
10289	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.
10290	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help him solve the problems faced by the people.
10291	If you are a close friend of the Prime Minister then understanding the issues that are faced by the people is very important to help the Prime Minister.
10292	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. Thus, knowing the people well is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.

10294	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because he had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
10295	 Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other countries for about four years. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up badly. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
10296	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other'more useful' countries for about four years. He left the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, Raffles' all those countries that were run by Raffles all ended up badly. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
10297	Raffles didn't work for Singapore when he went around conquering other'more useful' countries. He left all the work to Farquhar to settle, plus, he also left Singapore badly run by the country, show Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
10298	Singapore was neglected by Raffles, who went around conquering other "useful" countries for about 4 years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
10299	After 1,000 years, Raffles neglected Singapore. He never spent time developing it, and left it in the hands of Farquhar, a bad developer of the country. The countries he ruled all failed.

10304	Raffles only opened a single section of the Singapore Straits and did not actually invest a penny in the business while William Farquhar had contributed handsomely in building up Singapore to become a modern nation.
10305	Pro life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack addicted / poverty ridden babies are born. Pro Choice ftw.
10306	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied. Pro-Choice ftw
10307	Pro-Life means that the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, but also many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice is a perfect argument.
10308	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice is what it really means.
10309	Pro-Life and Pro-Choice. It's important for me that people understand the issues. I believe that there will be poverty ridden babies born whether or not we want them. There will always be, but the ability to choose life or choose death is very important.
10310	I'm against it. I think the 14 year old should get the baby. She's a teenager, she's not old enough to have a baby.
10311	Those that say a teenager should die if she survives a rape do not truly understand the ins and outs of rape. As a doctor, I know rape is NOT a chump act. The rape victim does not have any say in whether her attacker will kill her. Thus, those that say, "I want to force the teenager to abort," are showing true sociopathy when they coopt the teenager into this horrendous decision.
10312	If a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, and because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? It's pro-life to keep the baby alive.
10313	Is abortion immoral? Probably not, but this is a position that only God will know.
10314	It's not the time or it's not the place to get into the whole pro/anti-abortion argument.
10315	Could be. However, that may only be true in some cases.
10316	Really? What if my opponent has been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would that make your arguments any weaker? Well I think it may just be that my opponent can't think for himself.
10317	You can debate theories that you disagree with, but once you get out of the academic debate, arguing based on agreed upon facts is the only thing left.
10318	ACTUALLY, what if I my opponent had been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth and all of this is the root of the problem? Then it makes the argument weaker than it might sound on its surface. It just shows what sort of insanity lies behind anti-choice arguments.
10319	What if I my opponent has ACTUALLY been brainwashed and indoctrinated since birth? Would that make your arguments any weaker?
10320	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen? Why doesn't God do it himself? Who says that God did it himself? Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur? FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION
10321	Who says that God did it himself? Who says that God didn't cause the big bang or evolution to occur? FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION

10325	But porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Nope. If you don't like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
10326	In movies and TV shows, sex scenes are used to entertain and generate profits. The porn industry is made up of thousands of employees, who are making a living through work. Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Nope. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
10327	Although pornography is in entertainment, sex scenes in movies and TV shows are not evil. It is the viewers responsibility to choose the right film and programs.
10328	In point of view, in porn, you see sex. If you do not like it, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
10329	There are some people that don't like porn, and for this reason they do not watch it. There is nothing wrong with watching porn and this is their right to do so.
10330	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. They would spend all of their time and money on others than themselves.
10331	Well, I see the perspective of my parents. They would spend all of their money and time on others than themselves.
10332	From a perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make us, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of their money and time on others than themselves.

10335	In the right circumstances, everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
10336	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our lives would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two. The common good of the whole community and society in general. They do really help a lot and are a lot of people's pastimes.

10338	There are plenty of jobs that do just that. Their is nothing wrong with using your gifts to better yourself as well as the world.

10340	It is about the common good because the type of forces that you can make as a whole group is better than having a few people with different ideas. When you look at the whole the population or percentage of the whole is bigger than of those who did not vote. So if you want a good to be down and win, you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
10341	Yes, people have the right to vote, and when that happens, you make up the rest of the population. This percentage is greater than those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
10342	The common good is about how you can work together with others to bring about a good. This person who does not want to vote just needs to find another person who does have the same views, and both vote. If he would only bring others with the same views he would defeat those he did not like. So a good is a win when the whole group stands together.
10343	It is a good because it involves the type of forces you can make as a whole group. like if someone says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be done you need more than yourself to do it by looking for others with the same views.
10344	Everyone is well-meaning and makes a good impression, but people need to show them what the real consequences are and communicate the true face of governments and corporations for a better, more just society. If more people won the lottery for example, would people pull out their cashmere sweaters again? Not really, not if there were people waiting for the money to pay their taxes.
10345	Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that a uniform should be worn in school in order to improve student attendance and to make students spend less time on buying clothes for school. In general, one may think that a uniform would leave more time for doing homework and learning.
10346	The school uniform is a good idea, because school uniform improves student attendance and students don't spend much time to choosing and buying clothes for school. Especially girls can spend more time to study.
10347	Counselors and teachers should emphasize that children should not wear uniforms for school because it makes the students dislike school and it may interfere with learning.
10348	My idea of the school uniform is that it improves student attendance and student doesn't spend a lot of time to choosing and buying clothes for school. That is why they can use more time to study.
10349	I believe that the school uniform is a good idea because it improve student attendance and it saves time for students so that they can study more time, especially girls. They are not wasting time that can be used to study.
10350	There is nothing wrong in wearing whatever clothes you like. You are a human being, not a statue. You can choose whatever look you like.
10351	It makes all students look and feel equal which increases their attention on school work since they don't have to think if they are wearing the most expensive cloth is school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest and so on.
10352	Girls shouldn't tease each other about fashion issues since it makes school life difficult for them and it also increases their attention on school work since they have to think if they are wearing the most expensive cloth and they shouldn't think about their looks or having to find out who's wearing the most expensive cloth or if they are looking coolest and prettiest and so the, etc....:D
10353	It makes all students look and feel equal by not having to think if they are wearing the most expensive clothes at school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest. Also, a girl should not tease another girl about her fashion choices.
10354	It could even help students focus more on their school work since they don't have to think if they are wearing the most expensive clothes or if they look the coolest and prettiest.
10355	Fathers can be lousy sometimes but they are through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates us to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.

You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most. No matter how tall you've grown.
10357	No, parents can't learn anything from their mistakes. You can't teach their mistakes to your children because even if you did it's not the same. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them and you can't have a healthy family if you have a father that doesn't guide you at all. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.
10358	However, your fathers are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them and you can't have a healthy family without two parents to guide you in life. In other words, you can't have a healthy family if you do not have two fathers to guide you.
10359	Whether they are lousy or not they are the people who teach you how to live. You cannot have a healthy family without having a father who can tell you how to live your life and a mother who can guide you in such regards.
10360	This is a load of bullshit. Those arguments are not factual, and make your team appear like a bunch of foolish fools.

10365	Profits make people live longer well without water have fun with that
10366	Profits and health are better than water and fun. Have fun with that.
10367	Profits. Have you ever wondered if you could live longer and more healthily without water? Well, the answer is YES!
10368	Profits in life is a rather selfish matter that is often done for the sake of money rather than for the longevity of people. Well without water you can live longer but you shouldn't be doing this to have
10369	Profits may be fine, but as long as the world continues to get healthier, and people are able to live longer, there will be no need to get rich because it would be only to help improve

10380	American people spend billions of dollars on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy, in addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of and advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable water bottles are also coming onto the market. These can be used instead of plastic to eliminate that detriment, and bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur.

10382	The plastic water bottles cost billions and are detrimental to the environment because they use a lot of water and never biodegrade. Water bottles are an unnecessary hassle to both consumers and manufacturers of water bottles. The fact that water bottles are banned helps to preserve clean drinking water and preserve the environment at the same time. Water has been found in all rivers and streams and oceans and everywhere in the world and no one who uses bottled water would deny this. It has also been found that if we use only tap water than this would save the planet billions of dollars. The truth is that water is a natural element that is obtainable just about anywhere. Just like air we breathe, water is just a part of the universe and everything in the universe is connected to everything else.

We test our water when it comes into the plant and for consistency several times per hour at every stage of the bottling process. Every year, we screen for over 200 possible contaminants-far more than state and federal regulations require. It’s almost ridiculous to take action on this with this huge world-wide epidemic in sight. Make no mistake; if the world didn;t have human beings, it would be a much healthier environment.
10395	From a religious standpoint, gay marriage is not even possible. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.

10397	From a religious standpoint, gay marriage is not possible. Let's put it this way, as much as we might wish it was, it isn't. The word "marriage" may be misused in this case, but civil unions, well that's a different matter altogether.
10398	These words are misused often. Civil unions also play a role in a couple's lives. Sometimes even religious.
10399	From a religious standpoint, gay marriage is not even possible. By all means let the people decide for themselves, but let's not confuse legal marriage with wedding.
10400	Well I guess Id call it "unnatural." In the definition of marriage and sex because they are supposed to follow the guidelines that have been laid down by religion
10401	People don't follow human nature. It's actually very different than the original text. They don't follow human nature by doing the wrong thing, if it was really what they did. They do the wrong thing because God does so. Without God, people would still do the right thing, if it was really what they did, as well as something called "Godly manners", or human decency. When people didn't follow the rules and didn't follow human nature in the original text, the way they acted was because God said to do it.
10402	Humans are born with this ability to partake in good and evil. No religion can explain the differences in how we decide to act within that capacity.
10403	Signing up for sex education would be misplaced on the grand scale, unless it was like when they taught us the "mean girl" unit in middle school where they told us about how girls were bad... if you had been told that that stuff in your middle school years, then there might have been a better chance at not becoming a mean girl later in life... in a sense, education is useful for instilling morals and concepts... without it, we would be a loose cannon? but how would we respond to the same things if we didn't know...
10404	I vote wrong. It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". Also you can't exclude religion from this argument, because that what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.
10405	Incestual marriage is not right nor wrong. Gay marriage includes incestual homosexual marriages in the countries that have legalized it. The gay marriage rate has decreased in those countries.
10406	If incestual relationships are wrong, what about incestuous homosexual relationships? Does homosexuality lead to a lower marriage rate? Which country legalized incestuous homosexual relationships that led to a lower marriage rate?
10407	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?
10408	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate? Do you agree with these statements?
10409	Does incestual marriage sound right? Does gay marriage sound right? Which country legalized homosexual unions? Did homosexual unions lead to a lower marriage rate?
10410	To me gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but I don't agree that it's an unnatural way.
10411	To me gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but to me it is not natural and against my moral law.
10412	To me gay marriage is wrong, but I respect other opinions that disagree. I myself wouldn't marry gay people, but I respect their wishes.

10414	To me, gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but to me it is an unnatural way and against my moral law.

10420	India is a good country to live in... Hindu becomes common because it unites as one. India is a place to visit.
10421	India is a good country to live in... It has diverse culture but still it unites as one. India is a good place to work as well. Hindustan a our home.

10425	Anyone who thinks that by the debates alone they will solve all the problems are wrong. Because they also know that how a country is governed.
10426	India is a complex country with many problems that only debate cannot resolve.
10427	Every Indian who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems of their country is wrong. They are also aware that how India is.
10428	Using the word just means the person thinks that the country should have some problems and he or she is doing any thing to solve it. But the person also knows the country is doing so many things to reduce the problems.
10429	only by debate will they solve all the problems, because they also know that the India is an inner most country as well.
10430	India is very good at leading world. However, China also is very strong. And America continues to outsource good manufacturing jobs to these countries to result in an economic boost to these two countries!
10431	India has potential to lead the world, but so does China! America continues to outsource good manufactoring jobs to these countries resulting in an economic boost for India and China!
10432	India can lead the world, but so can China. The United States continues to outsource manufacturing jobs to these countries because they continue to be economically successful.

10435	Yeah, the Atheist is a cool guy. Makes my logic work and doesn't get upset easily.
10436	Atheism is pretty cool. Makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.

10445	True, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children but it shouldn't be the last option.
10446	Spanking as a discipline is the last option, but parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children.
10447	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it shouldn't be their first option.
10448	Spanking should only be used as an option to discipline your child only when all other methods have been tried and have not worked.
10449	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be only the last option.
10450	Discipline is a good thing, but use it the right way. Sometimes it won't work so it doesn't always work without a spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. Don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad.
10451	yea, it doesn't always work, sometimes it won't even work. So you need a little spanking and teaching them they were wrong and they need to learn. Don't spank them for no reason and don't always be spanking them.
10452	Spanking kids for no reason, that's bad. Don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad.
10453	Discipline your kids in many other ways. Don't always be spanking your kids. It's bad to do so.
10454	To spank them for no reason is not good, because if they don't see a reason it might not work. Sometimes we don't always spank them if they have done something wrong, because if they don't see a reason it might not work.
10455	Raising your children is extremely important, and I think you should spank them on their hands and feet once in a while to teach them some lessons. Don't spank them with whatever you find. You don't want to kill them.
10456	We should not spank children. We were spanked when we were little, but we did learn things. Don't spank your children unless the situation warrants it!
10457	Don't spank your kids though whatever you find, you don't want to kill them!!
10458	Think twice before spanking your kids or whatever the hell you spank them with. You don't want to kill them.
10459	You don't want to kill your kids. So spank them once in a while but with whatever you find. Don’!t spank them with things that could kill them.
10460	Parental punishment is only effective with some of the children. Some kids need less punishment and other more. Depending on the punishment is possible that the child will do the act again.
10461	There should be no punishment for kids anymore. Depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need the punishment. Because just sitting them in punishment it's a possibility that they will do it again.
10462	The punishment depends on the child, some children need punishment and others don't. If you only sit them in punishment it's a possibility they will do it again.
10463	There should be no argument in this really... whatever way u see a fetus... its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you... and if you didn't wannna get preggo in the first place... don't have sex
10464	Because of the way you punished a child it doesn't always work. Some kids need some kind of punishment. But if they are punished all the time they can get the idea that punishment works to get things done and they will do the same thing.
10465	Definitely Christianity because we can learn a lot about our amazing God from that.

10470	To get rid of destructive drugs, the idea is not only to pass legislation prohibiting them but also to be violent against the sellers. The united states is not the only country where drugs are a

10475	No, because they are barely grown up and they are still trying to understand the world.
10476	Yes, because they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.
10477	No, because they don't have the maturity to understand their gender.
10478	No. Because they barely grow up, still trying to understand the world.
10479	The laws of germany are rested on shaky ground since kids are trying to explore the world and are poorly corrected by thos in authority.
10480	No, it's not wrong to spank kids. A spanking might make the relationship between the child and the parents. Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
10481	For me, a punitive measure, such as spanking, might affect the relationship between the child and the parents. The child can pick up on the parents' behavior acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example, using the other techniques.
10482	There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
10483	Because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.

10485	Young children don't understand the meaning of what is wrong and what is right.
10486	It is a young child and does not know what is wrong and what is right.
10487	Young children don't know right from wrong, so adults have to guide them.
10488	The child isn't mature enough to know what is right and wrong, so any actions that he takes should be legalized.
10489	It is too young to understand what is wrong and what is right.
10490	Parents don't have to like their children, however, they should encourage them to develop a healthy lifestyle. Since people can't grow up well when people don't get enough exercise, and they should be made to participate in organized sports. When a
10491	Spanking isn't an option because nobody likes it.
10492	Spanking shouldn't be an option because it is contrary to human nature.
10493	I don't think anyone would have liked to get spanked by their parents, so I don't think it should be an option for the parents to spank their kids.
10494	There might be some people who would have liked to get spanked but I don't think that is the case. Therefore spanking shouldn't be an option.

10496	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.

10498	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
10499	Physical abuse towards children causes them to live in constant fear of their parents and may cause a stutter.
10500	Even though people make mistakes, murder is always committed with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. I would not want to live under the same roof with a woman that can be schizophrenic.

10505	After the rape, if she put the baby up for adoption it's her decision to make. If someone murders the pregnant women, she should be charged for killing her. People say that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. To look it up in the dictionary you need a new computer, so you don't have a chance to look it up yourself.
10506	If a woman gets raped, and is left with the child, then she should put it up for adoption. If someone murders a pregnant woman, they should get charged for the killing of the woman and the fetus. People have the excuse that it is not a baby, but it is a fetus. If you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
10507	If someone murders a pregnant woman, they are charged for killing the woman and the fetus. People have the stupid excuse that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. If you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.

10510	One of the challenges of trying to define various terms is the process of encountering every possible definition and describing in detail why it can or cannot be used.
10511	Do not mix the topic of the debate! The debate is not about which circumstances justify a murder being morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can say that a murder victim has a right to kill. In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and your sources if you aren't quite as literate as I'd like you to be, to vary your sources and your stories. The debate is not about which circumstances justify a murder being morally acceptable, but rather whether or not the legal (some may say moral) foundation for murder can be justified. In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and use more credible sources in your stories, to vary your stories and your sources to make them less journalistic and more varied.
10512	Your argument is faulty. The debate is not about determining under what circumstances murder is morally acceptable but rather about legal (or moral) foundations on which one can say a person has the right to kill another. In addition, you should brush up on your etymology and vary your sources if you want to find the original definitions of the words that you use.
10513	Unless she has a valid birth certificate, abortion is still illegal.
10514	To determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. Some feminists agree with this, though they think that (1) the decision to choose to have the abortion should have at least some legal bearing and (2) the mother's health is the most important issue. In reality, however, I am not sure how a pregnant woman of modest means would be able to afford to throw her life away and lose a baby instead of cash or a home to someone who might or might not give them a reason to continue to live with a husband or lover. In any case, I think there needs to be a clear legal precedent in which a woman has the legal right to decide whether or not to keep a baby.
10515	There are many people in my school who are fat but two periods of PE a week and afterschool sports has NOT changed any of them in one bit.
10516	Yeah, I agree with NO WAY because there are many people in my school who are overweight. There are 2 periods of PE a week. Afterschool sports does not affect them in any way.
10517	There are many people in my school who are fat, and two periods of PE a week and after school sports has not changed any of them a tiny bit.
10518	NO WAY! There are many people in my school who are overweight and two periods of PE a week and afterschool sports has not changed any of them. a tiny bit
10519	In my school, there are many students who are overweight and two periods of PE a week and afterschool sports hasn't changed them at all.
10520	First of all, I think it would be hypocritical for me to say that if some gay person chooses to be with a person of their same sex, I am not happy for them. Also, I think it's unfair to accuse them of doing something wrong when they are simply a lifestyle choice and everyone is supposed to be free to do what they want. Let's be responsible as well! Just because someone is gay, doesn't mean they're bad people. They have the right to be with who they like and to live a life that best suits their personality. I don't think we should be too quick to judge other people or their lifestyle choices. We all have something to learn from everyone else.
10521	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way.

10525	Posting a comment that says you don't care and everyone should stop talking about it, and that is a good post. Also, it is sad that people who post comments like mine make me sick.
10526	Nobody said you had to read this or vote on this or post a comment. I used the button "who gives a crap" because I was frustrated with the lengths people would go to. Also, people who post comments like mine make me sick.
10527	Someone who posts comments on this site, like mine, should probably stop yapping and talking and listen to the people who actually have an opinion. And, one final thing, people who post comments like mine makes me sick.
10528	Another thing I just think is funny, is people that post comments like my comment did it not to make my comments funny, and also they make me sick because it doesn't matter how they comment, it will just make them look stupid, goofy, and irritating and I'll know right away it's your type. And also if you were commenting to say that you agree with me, you should bring up a good point, instead of saying that everyone should stop talking about it, that would've been a better argument. You should support my comment with a good argument. And also stop bothering me, if I'm not addressing you, it's because I don't need to be bothered by you. And people who don't know anything about the campaign come
10529	Did you know that the "who gives a crap" button was a browser's back button? No one said you had to read this or vote on this or post a comment. It always baffles me to see people take the time to post a comment to say they don't care and everyone should stop talking about it. And another thing... people who post comments like mine make me sick.
10530	Let me start by saying that I feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needs to be abolished, however that's another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell I think animals should be allowed to get married, it would surely be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so than any wedding I have ever attended.
10531	To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
10532	To me, who wants to get married, is wholly irrelevant. Aside from Christians (spice?), no real reason to get married unless the two people wish to do so. Hell, I think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, they would surely be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so, than any wedding I have ever attended.
10533	It doesn’t matter whether you want to get married or not, animals should have the right to do the same too. It would be an entertaining ceremony which more than likely humans would spend far more time on than marriage as an institution itself. Far more important than who weds whom is the love between the two.
10534	Let me start by saying I do not believe in marriage as an institution but I do believe it to be a building blocks for a happy family. I also do not believe in premarital sex. And I believe a man to have a one- thing girlfriend, if you believe that, then the only number of those new father should not be allowed to have sex with their wives while they are trying to get pregnant, but while it's not happening. And I feel that as women it is our duty to get pregnant and that we have the right of having sex with multiple partners at least once in our lives. I feel being a single mother is not nearly as terrible as a divorced, motherless and gay child. And I
10535	In my personal opinion you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them. If you don't even have a good job you can't take care of yourself and fix the problems, you will eventually end up having a breakdown or something.
10536	When bettering yourself, you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a breakdown or something.
10537	In my opinion, if you improve yourself in the long run, you can improve the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a breakdown or something.

10540	If you say that advancing the common good is better then a personal pursuit, then you would be lying to yourself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that there are too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do won't really make a difference. A personal pursuit does more for you then trying to advance the common good in a world where you see very little good.
10541	People always say that making the world a better place is better then a personal pursuit, but the problem with that is that, there is too much of bad things going on in the world and the difference you can really make is so very small. A personal pursuit can do more for you then trying to make the world better place, because the world is already pretty bad.

10543	If you were doing good, that would be a personal pursuit and not advancing the common good. The problem is that there is very little good in the world, and thus even if you were doing good you won't really make a difference. Personal pursuits do more for you than trying to advance the common good in a world where you see very little good.
10544	Asking me to say what I think I would like, it just would not be correct.
10545	If you want to help others around you, it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit is not always about money, but it can also be about happiness, love, and success.
10546	It starts with you because your personal pursuit is what drives you. Whether it's to make money to help the needy or the common good, it starts with your personal desire to make money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money, but it can also be about happiness, love, and success.
10547	That is entirely a personal pursuit because you can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.
10548	On the personal pursuit thing, I agree that if a person pursues a personal happiness or interests for a longer time, it makes life happier and more fulfilling. Also, I think the most significant pursuit in anyone's life should be they self and their happiness. The only way to get rich is to put yourself first and work for happiness and success.
10549	Making money for the needy or the common good starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.
10550	To keep our jobs, pay the working people decent wages that keep up with the cost of living, which wouldn't be near what it is if we had kept our jobs at home all along anyway; stop voting self-raised for our political leaders; stop trying to be the world's peacemakers, money controllers - both providing and then forgiving debt only to “loan” more; and realize that all the world has the same abilities and resources we started with, they just need to make a choice to utilize the resources they have and develop a work ethic and use it.

10554	Keeping our jobs at home, paying the working people decent wages that keep them up to date with the cost of living, that wouldn't be near what it is if we kept our jobs at home all along anyway.

10555	There's no doubt that the United States has been gunning for his death all along and will reluctantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty.  But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the glowing eyes & stance when in court he recently told the judge “I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?”  The recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddams case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts?  No. The chair will probably decay and break, and the switches/ wires will rust or melt away. And don't suggest a rope, because there is no such strong rope exists in the World to snap such a strong throat.

10557	Probably Saddam Hussein will be hanged. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast.

This recent spate of bombings in Iraq between the Shias and Sunnis is directly connected with Saddams case. Which country would ever allow a foreign country to set up courts? No. The chair will probably decay and break, and the switches/ wires will rust or melt away.

10558	The United States has been gunning for his death for years now, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. But you must also know, that even today Saddam is a feared and respected man by many in Iraq. The outcome will not be settled so fast. Did you see the Glaring eyes and stance when in court he recently told the judge "I am the ruler of Iraq and who are you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?"

10559	In spite of all Bush has done, the Americans have been gunning for his death all along, and will defiantly impress upon the tribunal to give the Death penalty. No, a foreign country will never allow a court to be set up in its territory by a foreign country. Even today, Saddam is feared and respected by many Iraqis. The outcome of this case will not be settled so easily. Did you see his eyes in court the other day when he told the judge "I'm the ruler of Iraq, and you, a foreigner trying to pass judgement on me?" There has been a lot of spate of bombings between Shias and Sunnis in Iraq in the past few days. This is all related to the case of Saddam Hussein. How are any outside country going to have the authority and authority to run such a system in Iraq? That would never happen in the future. These dastardly facts can't be denied. So it is necessary for the tribunal to see and accept this sentence. The chair will probably age and break down, and the switches and wires will rust and melt away. Don't suggest a rope. There is no such strong rope in the world to cut such a strong throat
10560	Yes, it should be of unlimited proportions. Freedom of speech should not and cannot be twisted to the point where it is no longer freedom of speech. However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries. However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting. They are ruining their credibility and making themselves look like a bunch of whinging little kids who riot at the most petty insult. Do you know how many "Jesus Christ" parody websites exist online? How many Christians burn down embassies for stuff like that?

10565	If an employer discharges you, they have to pay any wages owed to you plus any other compensation on the spot. As a manager, you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss has to prove you took the money, but you might be able to get your job back, talk to the state or federal department of labor. You could possibly sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss can't prove you took the money.
10566	If an employer fires you,they have to pay you any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot. If your boss can't prove you took the money,you could sue him for wrongful termination.
10567	If an employer fires you, he is still legally responsible for you in the sense that he owes you the money you were owed, and on the spot that you were being paid, and he has to pay that. The fact that he says "but you might be able to get your job back" is irrelevant. As a manager, you are responsible for your employees and the money they are paid. A supervisor is above an employee. Your boss may have overlooked a few offenses and his dismissal was not warranted, but if he can't prove they were wrongful, he is still responsible. The rule of law applies. It has always applied. He cannot take the money. You should try to get your job back. Even if you believe the policy is so stupid that it is not justifiable, you are entitled to be paid your money on the spot if your boss says, "I am not fired, but you know what? There is some reason that, in

10570	No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it good or bad. In India, reservation was and is being used to please some people and get quick votes, whether it's for SC & ST provisions in the Constitution, which was original for 15 years or for the implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact that there are some strata of society who need support to rise up from their current status of poverty or backwardness. However, there is opposition to reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in upper or middle class and taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy gets the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.

10574	In India, reservations were and are used to please some people and get quick votes. There are some aspects of reservation, it is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. While in America, it was the very first president that supported voting rights for women and granting them the right to vote and the right to own property along with other important rights. Thus it was considered as a big step. But now it is being actively opposed by some politicians because even one woman killed here and there should really be made responsible. Reservation is what is needed but it should be done with care. No one is against it if it benefits truly needy people.
10575	If he is unhappy about the dogs, then that's where his problem lies. Either you find a good home for the dogs or train the dogs, or move out to a house so that the neighbourliness is maintained. But in fact, you have only one option: If he is messing with your property, that's where your problem is. Either you delete the content or put it on google so it doesn't appear. If he seems to be just messing around, call the police. They should kick him out of the apartment.
10576	There are few options that you have. You can't evict the guy. More complaints to the authorities are not going to get you anywhere.
10577	If he is unhappy with your dogs, that's where your problem lies. Either you find a good home for the dogs, train your dogs, or move out to a house to keep neighbourly peace, but it's really up to you. Most likely the guy is gathering evidence that your dogs are indeed behaving badly, or noisy, or destroying his belongings, so it would be a good idea to train your dogs.   I've lived in an apartment, and the concern is more for efficiency (all lugs and cranks under the stairs, clean out cabinets), self-reliance (get the stapler working again), and living with other people (how's your garbage disposal working). Living with other people can be difficult sometimes, but such is the life of living in an apartment.   I've lived in an apartment and have had to work sometimes. I've tried multiple jobs. I've always found there's so much better to be doing in life outside of work. The work I did, e.g., not giving people the information they need on the computers, was mostly assistant work. And I'm talking 15-20 hours per week here. A lot of work and some flexibility. The work is usually relatively easy and doesn't require me to be very clever. Also, sometimes more work is better than no work at all. E.g., my Dad's house has lost water recently. He's used to it, but as much as he enjoys water he doesn't know he has lost it. He has to start putting buckets out every morning. It might just be inconvenience. But it's

If your dogs are really doing something that is damaging or noisey then it would be a good idea to train the dogs. I've lived in an apartment and co-operation and sensitivity and tolerlance is sometimes not easy. But such is the life of living in an apartment. Two wrongs doesn't make a right. How many options do you have? You can't evict the guy. More complains to the authorities is not going to get you anywhere.

10580	Blackmail is where you offer to reveal something embarrassing, damaging or illegal but do not reveal the exact details of it, such as holding a gun to the head of a person and threatening to shoot them if they do not reveal this information for money or some other act.  The girl didn't do anything illegal, but I don't think it is blackmail exactly. It is to threaten to reveal the information for money, which the police could think about if they had a gun and a threat.
10581	Blackmail is where you offer NOT to reveal some embarassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act: No, there is no force or coercion. The threat is real.
10582	Blackmail is where you offer not to reveal some embarrassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act. An example: Obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion. It is no criminal offense to offer information to a researcher for money without asking questions because what you are offering is not the information itself. A blackmail is where there is no act and neither force. I don't think this is blackmail exactly, because there is no force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
10583	What is blackmail? Blackmail is when you offer not to reveal some embarrassing or damaging piece of information for money or some act: It can be something very trivial like a lie about where you've been the last night or it could be something more dramatic like: obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion. There is neither force nor coercion. Because I'm a big fan of the Twilight movie franchise and I don't wanna see what's inside, I would agree to the proposal. I don't think this is blackmail exactly, because there is no force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. Therefore, I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal, it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.

10585	Diabetes is a condition that is built up over time. When you became unemployed, you had an injury and your next job should provide you health insurance coverage.
10586	Diabetes is a condition that is built up over time. You can't sue your company for a condition that you may have been prone to get due to poor health, eating habits or just outright laziness.

10590	Kids seem to be older, wearing makeup, hair gel, stylish clothing, and designer accessories in elementary school.  I wish I could look like an adult when I was small. Kids have a wardrobe of electronic gadgets too.  They are desensitized to content like death and sex at an earlier age. What does this mean?  Kids grow up faster?  Maybe on the outside.  If you take away all of these external modern devices, emotionally, they grow at a natural pace.  Perhaps with so many distractions, overstimulated kids need more time to catch up to the quiet time they missed.

10593	 Kids grow older wearing makeup and hair gel, stylish clothing and designer accessories because they have access to technology. They look grown up. Children take their electronic gadgets with them to school and use technology because they cannot get enough of them. Emotionally, the slow growth of children can be treated as delayed maturity. They are fatigued by stimulants. Teenagers might grow faster if left to their own devices with very little external stimulation. I believe it is the parents' fault that they cannot attend to their children.
10594	Kids grow up faster because they spend less time with parents who don't surf the net, read books, play outside or have time to go to class.  Emotionally, I think kids need more time to catch up to the quiet time they missed.
10595	Let's stop talking about ethics here... I know you don't like Islam but the point I'm trying to make is it's a perverted religion. It advocates against respect, equality, and individual freedom. It favors virtue over reward. It promotes violence and hatred. So whatever you think about it, there should be no argument because it is a perverted religion...
10596	Not all Hitler's policies were unethical. His policies, if done judiciously, could be good for the United States.
10597	If you mean good unethical arguments to rationalize his actions, Hitler did the same thing. He thought the world would be better off with him in power. He was a dictator. You are referring to an ethical argument in favor of Stalin. Not an ethical argument in favor of Hitler. You can continue to argue that it is either a lie or fiction to accuse Hitler of it. It really wasn't fiction is it? You just need some ammunition. Well I won't give it to you because there is nothing ethical about bombing Japan. Truman was led to believe there were military targets, when most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke two cities. It was entirely political. And the United States is at war with its neighbor. Would you really want to support that?
10598	To be honest I think that after Hitler's actions of killing so many civilians with gas or armored trains, what he can say seems meaningless, and in fact it seems like there wasn't anything ethical or moral about his actions. Truman was led to believe they were military targets, when in fact most were women and children. There wasn't a military target in sight! And we didn't have to nuke two cities!
10599	We were led to believe there were military targets, when in fact most were women and children, there was no military target in sight, and we didn't have to nuke two cities.

There wasn't an ethical reason for nuking Japan. Truman was led to believe that they were military targets, when in fact they were just buildings. There was nothing ethical about nuking two cities to save a few armaments. Truman was led to believe they were military targets when in fact they were not! It was all a cover to take over the country!

Chin Up.  Unless you are in a private college which does not accept government funds, what you pay in tuition is about half the actual cost of your education. Alumni associations and taxpayers (who will not directly benefit from your education) are paying the rest.
10608	It's not about what's best for you, it's about what's best for your wallet. A school is a business, and business costs money. In return, you get education at a cost that's half the actual cost. Alumni associations and taxpayers (who will not directly benefit from your education) are the ones paying the rest.
10609	But there are still some obvious exceptions to this eg budget cuts, military, supreme court justices and legislation like Obamacare, even the American democracy you have run into legal problems with.  A teacher's fees, such as an assistant/assistant's fees and also the professional tax for a CPA or attorney, all of this should be mandatory at least part of government employee salaries (example: at minimum 20 percent salary must be retated in taxes), these fees are to provide a service, as an employee of the government, and in return for that service you the citizen deserve a return as the government has to pay the fees for that.  The idea should be mandatory to pay the certain amounts for education in order to make the teaching profession profit with the government salary of teachers in order to cover the education costs of the schools, with the government only retating a certain percentage to the teachers' salary.  You know at the beginning of a school year if the school has a budget shortfall and students can't pay the room and board costs, the school has no choice but to cut classes. and because a school is a business, that means teachers have to be paid less during a financial crisis which means more training for the teaching staff and new salary can be requested for teachers during a crisis.  A country such as the US with its long history of wars, health and universal education comes to the fact that the serving military of the country is important to the protection of a
10610	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it doesn't cause harm to others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against your government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Also, our country is a lot better then many other countries and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.

10615	He drives too fast for you?  Speed up yourself as much as possible. If he is speeding or driving recklessly, then the cops can ticket him. There is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas just so you can deliver them. In fact, it goes against every cannon of customer service. The faster the delivery the better (as long as nobody gets injured).
10616	Make sure you drive fast enough that he cannot go over the speed limit. If he's driving recklessly then the cops can ticket him. But there is no law that says the managers must hold back pizzas just so you can deliver them. And faster deliveries are better (as long as nobody gets injured).
10617	Once upon a time, managers thought that they had to hold back the pizzas so that the customers could get them. It's completely fine to give the customers the faster the order, as long as nobody gets injured.  In fact, it's against every cannon of customer service to give the customers faster service in exchange for little trickery.

10620	In fact, many countries including Great Britain do provide generous and safe shelter for some large groups of Muslims and even have segregated communities within their borders.  Even many countries in the Caribbean, which suffered from the ravages of slavery are favorably treating their southern African guest workers.  In fact, most Western countries openly welcome both Christians and Muslims and they are not even required to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits.  I don't think we need to hold out hopes of tolerance from culturally different groups or religious dissidents, like the Muslim faith, because that is something unrealistic, and we are being as realistic as we are practical and sensible.  These people, as we find out, are as supremely arrogant and godless as any other nationalistic group you can come up with.  We should not hold out for something impossible or unattainable like ‘peace through tolerance’, because we can always hope for things that are achievable and beneficial. {If you're looking to hold the water bottles for any reason other than hygiene, please throw away the bottle as we have no room in our landfill to expand!
10621	Christianity, Islam, and the Communists and Liberals of this country are free to do whatever they wish, but unfortunately, they are abusing the generous and comforting tolerance of this country and minority communities who are welcomed in this country to their own country, that's where the abuse appears.
10622	They don't, they have a free and open society and although they are traditionally Christian, Muslims are allowed to build mosques anywhere and way they want, and are even free to live in segregated communities. They don't even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country.
10623	They don't discriminate against Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, whoever.  They have a free and open society and although they are traditionally Christian, they're allowed to build mosques anywhere and build segregated communities.  They don't even need to learn the language to collect on health and welfare benefits of their host country. It makes absolutely no sense, I mean...kinda like people complaining about a hole in the ozone layer. And besides, there's always plenty of alcohol to drink.  And who cares about guest treatment?
10624	Though Switzerland does not have a formal Islamic community, locals are beginning to see Islamic invaders. They love to drink beer and go to a strip club, and they now say that if you want to live in Switzerland you must change your religion and dress in a skirt or a burka. They simply cannot accept these radical views, and see them as a threat to the freedom of others. Because they are intolerant, the Swiss have decided that they are no longer welcome and must leave.

10630	In the case of Brian Doyle, he should have gotten what he deserved. Without the ability of law enforcement to improvise on the books criminals would be free to run amok in this country. It is hard enough to get a conviction with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in this country and even harder to get anyone who commits any serious crime to the extra jail time needed to make this work. Why would you think law enforcement would have enabled this guy to carry out his crimes? He was looking for a 14 year old girl and when he found her, he raped her. Don't confuse the issues. This guy is a pedophile who preyed on young children by breaking into their homes, taking their phones, email accounts and passwords and collecting credit card information.
10631	The death penalty should not be allowed in this country because crimes are horrible and horrific. We need to treat our offenders with respect and shouldn't kill them.
10632	Do you really want a law enforcement system where people can be taken out by the FBI whenever they get convicted of a crime? Do you really think you should give criminals carte blanche to do as they wish in this country? Law Enforcement does not Enable anyone to do anything unlawful, it is the judge that will determine if such behavior is bad or good. This entire episode should have gone to court and had a jury decide if he is a pedophile or not. The judge will decide if it is or is not a crime. Each judge should be able to take out just the people in that court who he does not like. Do you think that there is any justice in this country? Probably not...the justice system only works for those who have friends with any law enforcement officers in charge. Its because of this that so many people are being brought into court on false charges. This guy who was convicted by a judge without a jury, is an example of how the Justice System works. Don't blindly believe what your neighbors are telling you, most likely he never did anything. A criminal is a criminal and a pedophile is a pedophile and there are no loopholes in the way anyone can come home from prison and continue with their crimes. The system doesn't work for all and why would it? We have Al Capone, Dillinger and every other convicted criminal who was arrested and didn't do anything right. Do you really want to enact a law where those who are convicted
10633	If law enforcement were able to improvise criminals would run amok in this country. It is hard enough anymore just to get a conviction with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in this country much less anyone doing any serious time for such illicit behavior. I assure you if it was your 14 year old daughter that was being sexually assaulted by this guy you would be stomping your feet and complaining that law enforcement didn't do enough. Law Enforcement did not Enable him he was seeking out a 14 year old girl. Don't confuse the issues. This guy is and was a pedophile and preyed on little children period.
10634	With law enforcement not being able to improvise, criminals would run amok in the country. It is hard enough already just to get a conviction. with all the legal loopholes created by liberal lawyers in the country. it is harder to get convicted with all the legal loopholes opened up in this country by liberal lawyers. It is harder even just to get a conviction. Don't confuse the issues. This man is a pedophile and preyed on little children period.
10635	No I haven't asked her or her family members anything like that yet, because I am in an effort to avoid conflict. However, it would probably be advisable if I had a good conversation about it with them in the near future. I think that would be my best approach, because it would be more honest with them if I offered to pay for them to have day care assistance or something like that. If they were interested in receiving any help, I think that would be fine, but I also know that being honest with them is also very important.
10636	Some people get stuff for free or low cost assistance or scholarships. Such as Daycare Asst.. So tell her or help her find those services.
10637	No I haven't. It sounds like its a friend that can get help through a pro-bono place, or a low income based legal services. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED  at what some places consider low income. My sisters husband brings home at least $400.00 a week in winter and at least $600.00 a week. in summer, and they have a three person household. They get approximately $46,000 a year bring home and they get help from W.I.C, daycare assistant, food excetra. So tell her - or help her, find those services.
10638	My sister has a 3 person household so she can get help through an operating expenditure.
10639	No I haven't but her sisters husband brings home $400.00 a week and in summer $6,000.00 a week! That is much more than your paycheck. Also, they have a 3 person household with 3 living human beings with hundreds of needs and medications. Their income is in the upper middle class but they live below the poverty line. I would be sorry to see them beg for help. Donate money to them or find those services.
10640	Absolutely not! It is the first step down a slippery slope to total government restriction. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.  Thank God we haven't reached a point where EVERYTHING that you SHOULD do you MUST under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
10641	Absoluteley yes. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt.

10644	TV is better than books because TV can bring you live news that you cannot find in books. Also, it's educational.
10645	Yes what good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free.  Throw the potheads in prison???  What kind of logic is this? Just because it has been illegal for a long time doesn't mean it's right.  "It's illegal for a reason".  Well, spitting in the street is in some places too.  Should we throw you in jail for that?  Bet, the same idiot that I quoted would be throwing a fit if he was written a ticket for spitting in the street.  Luckily, there is some reform going on in some states and in many parts of California now, it's pretty much ignored.  Those interested in this should get with NORML.  It's the National Organization for the Reform of Marjuana Laws.  Let's wake up.
10646	Yes, it's legal now. Why punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free? Throw the potheads in prison? What kind of logic is this? Just because it has been illegal for a reason does not mean that it's right. "It's illegal for a reason". Well, spitting in the street is in some parts too. Should we throw you in jail for that?

10647	Yes, punishing the lazy and letting wife beating alcoholics walk free, throwing potheads in prison, just because it has been illegal for a reason doesn't mean it's right.

10648	Yes!  What good does it do to punish the lazy and let wife beating booze heads walk free?  Throw the potheads in prison???  What kind of logic is this?  Just because it's been illegal forever doesn't mean that it's right.  "It's illegal for a reason".  Well, spitting in the street is in some places too.  Should we throw you in jail for that?  Bet, the same idiot that I quoted would be throwing a fit if he was written a ticket for spitting in the street.

10649	There is a lot of logic in the statement that "Just becaus it has been illegal forever doesn't mean it's right." It makes perfect sense though and I think that what the article is saying is correct.  "If a society that already has laws that are in place to prosecute people for certain types of crimes...it wouldn't make any sense to kill people with laws that have been in place forever". There is a point to being a law abiding citizen but there should be laws to support these laws and regulations for that reason.  The same way people have different points of views on marijuana use and I am sure that there are many people that consider it to be a dangerous drug.  They don't have it and I say that it should be decriminalized.  Same with the war on drugs.
10650	One of the greatest hurdles for women in many countries is being able to have sexual intercourse without being forced to have sex. Women don't have the right to choose what to do with their bodies.
10651	Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in the document and had to struggle to have their rights recognized. Human rights are not all encompassing and do not always address issues specific to females. Human rights are universal and cannot be ignored. So, although any discussion of human rights includes women, the overall umbrella of "human rights" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws that prevent women from enjoying the "human rights" that men have.
10652	Historically, when human rights were being defined, women were not included. For example: The United States Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized. Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of "human rights" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the "human rights" that men have.
10653	The US constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women were not included in the process.
10654	This historical example is out of date. Today, women do have human rights. But the more important fact is that the definition of "human rights" has included references to women. Human rights have not been defined with exclusivity towards any one gender. Therefore, gender specific issues like sexual abuse should be addressed in a discussion of human rights.
10655	I'm not sure what it is about water bottles and peanut butter and noodles that people are offended.
10656	I've always believed that women have as much right as men to be paid the same for equal work. That's one simple thing we all want: a decent wage. I think it could be argued that we already exist in exactly the same misogynistic world you describe. In the United States, women are paid only 75 cents for every $1.00 a man is paid for the identical work. In China, workers paid 60 cents on the dollar - some who just started working paid that! There's no money in making free goods for those who can't buy them, so where do they come from? The average poverty line in America is around $14,500, whereas more than two-thirds of the population is living in poverty, with women comprised of 70% of the world’s poor. Two-thirds of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. 75% of the world's illiterate adults are women. Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce half the world's food, yet only earn 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property. I'm not sure where we are on the gender equality issue, but I'm sure some people are unhappy about it.
10657	What do you think of my point? I think that being a feminist is okay, but, that doesn't make our world perfect. The world we live in is just, and there is nothing feminist about it.
10658	In the U.S. women are paid only 75 cents for every dollar a man is paid for the identical work. Two-thirds of the world loving in poverty are women. Three-quarters of the children denied even an elementary education are girls. Women are twice as productive as men, working more hours and producing half the food, yet they earn only 10% of the money and own just 1% of the property. Tell me exactly, how we're on such an even keel? How can anyone NOT be a feminist?
10659	According to this premise the economy is already in a very feminized state because only women can produce goods and men's roles are tied to what they do for cash.
10660	Cheating a theater out of ticket sales or affecting box office totals for a second film is cheating. It's dishonest because it is stealing.
10661	If you get caught, then the the manager has the discretion to remove you from the the and/or ban you from ever coming back.  This is dishonest.  If you paid to see one film, and then sneak in to see a second film, then you have cheated the theater out of ticket sales.  You also may be affecting the box office totals for the film you saw but didn't pay to see.  People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
10662	Many people try to sneak in to films that have been paid to see, but if they are caught and thrown out, then the theater manager has the discretion to remove them from the theater. This is dishonest-- it is stealing. They are also likely to be banned from ever coming back. The theater has business rules and the aim is to make money by selling tickets and turning a profit. People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
10663	If you get caught, then the manager has discretion to remove you from the theater and/or ban you from ever coming back. This is dishonest stealing, and cheating the theater out of ticket sales. If you were to sneak in to a second show and wouldn't pay to see it, you are affecting the box office for the film you were planning to see.
10664	To steal is to cheat the theater out of ticket sales and annoy the theater with your presence while the actor is on stage.  People do this all the time and get away with it, but it is still not right.
10665	If they are proven guilty, they should be sentenced to the penalty of death. If you were to execute a known felon who has himself murdered countless lives by freeing him from his prison sentence would they be able to commit other crimes?
10666	The defence of life and country is justified and necessary if it's to defend the people. If someone commits war crimes, it's treason. If a terrorist puts bomb in the city and kills others then he's deserving to get his life ended. Each side has the right to defend themselves and fight an unfair war. But I'm against violence, random violence that is. Sanctioned killings whereby a person has committed crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for war it depends on the reason, but if it's to the defence of life and country it is a noble cause, but if it's to a regime not friendly to a country that's self centered it's a little strange. When you fight on your own it's justified but if it's an outster of a country.
10667	Any actions that kill other human beings will not in any way be sanctioned. Punishment is a privilege for criminals. Instead we should rethinks the case instead of killing them.
10668	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people but for what reason. The execution of a known felon, who has him/herself murdered countless lives has forfeited his/her right to live under the eyes of the law. If he/she were to be set free and thus cause more deaths on the population, it is justified to take his life for the general good. They are against violence, random and senseless violence that is sanctioned killings whereby a person has committed crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for war it depends on the reason, to the defence of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outsider of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered, hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

10671	If he prescribed the drugs, he bears the legal responsibility, but it's possible that he doesn't actually have access to the records.

10675	I think the birth mother should have the right for "no contact." There could be an intermediary who could be contacted in the event of a medical emergency, or there could be some form of mediation by trained professionals such as the American Bar Association or NYS Bar Association.
10676	Women have to have some safeguard so they won’t feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. It’s very sad that abortions are often chosen because of these reasons.
10677	In my opinion, women need to have a safeguard so they won't feel pressured by the judgemental spirits of others about their unwanted pregnancy. I think abortions are frequently chosen because of these reasons.

10679	Women should be able to choose if they want to do all kinds of things with their unwanted child including killing it. There should also be a safeguard in the event of a medical emergency.  Abortion is often chosen because people feel that certain reasons go along with their choice. This is sad because when a woman feels she has unwanted a baby she would much rather have a healthy baby rather than a baby who has such diseases as Down syndrome.
10680	Well I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects and have now created a small fortune. I ow no one.  I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me what I have worked for!  Me and my brother were the only white kids in the projects... talk about unfair!  Take your cry for reparations to someone else... I simply don't buy it!
10681	Those that crave for more money or power is less educated then those who earn money from their employment, by being honest, giving good service and hard work.
10682	I disagree with the statement that because I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects and have now created a small fortune, I owe no one. I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for! Before that, I worked my but because of it my brother and I were the only white kids in the projects. Talk about unfair! It is not about black people in my life. I am now fighting for equality in this country. Take your cry for reparations to someone else because I owe no one, I just happen to have an advantage, which I work hard for.
10683	I'm in favor of reparations.  I started my life with nothing, grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune.  I owe no one!  I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for!
10684	I disagree with you because I started my life with nothing and grew up in the projects, and now I've made a small fortune and don't owe anyone. I don't understand why I should give up my hard earned money to complainers who say they deserve a quota!
10685	The scarlett letter license plates will not pass because some people hold high political offices or other esteemed jobs that have been caught for exactly that thing. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlett letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. Now if it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUI`s and not the senators, congressmen, etc, you bet it would pass.  As for Imani who answered before me, she`d better be glad she doesn`t live where I do, because that is exactly what one the judges in our county has people to do. I personally would think it is a deterrent and would think long and hard about doing something wrong if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime you will be required to  pay society back one way or the other.
10686	Some people in our society want to spend the rest of their life in jail. They think that people that commit crimes should not pay society back one way or the other because they think they are getting away with it. But I'd have to tell you that if you commit a crime, you will be required to pay society back one way or the other.
10687	Should be a deterrent for anyone who took part in whatever caused them to get the scarlet letter license plates. What I would do is use those plates to make sure that people knew they had done wrong in the past or are committing other crimes in the future. I would also not be using a scarlet letter to drive. I would not drive a vehicle with the scarab even if I did not face any legal repercussions.
10688	To prevent judges from using their positions to benefit personal gain, there is now a requirement in Virginia to wear a scarlett letter license plate. This is one way that judges and their wives can be honest and avoid any potential conflicts. It is also one way to deter offenders; though I do not know how much of a deterrent it actually is. Still, if I am one of the judges that is caught for offenses such as driving with a seatbelt with their scarlet letters out, I don`t want to risk my job.
10689	The scarlett letter plates will not pass because there are those who hold high political offices, such as senators, congressmen, and a number of other esteemed positions, who are being busted for the same thing. Do you think that they want to drive around with a scarlett letter license plate? This is the only reason this bill has repeatedly been defeated. If it was just Joe Smoe who was getting busted for the DUI`s and not the senators, congressmen, and other esteemed jobs, you bet it would pass. As for Imani, she's better off not living where I live, because there are people in our county who have similar restrictions. Personally, I'd think that this would deter any would-be offenders and would think long and hard before doing something wrong, if I had to do something like that. If you commit a crime, you'll pay for it some way or the other.
10690	He is as Christian as Bin Laden. I don't see that coming from him. But he has to use that group of people to his advantage when he has his legal troubles. It may backfire on him.
10691	Many wish he would be, but the reality is, if he does that there would be great uproar and the American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would just be unbearable and the economy of the USA would be negatively affected or even brought down lower it already is. The fact is Bush is using the "Born again church" to his advantage. Is he a Christian? Very much questionable, no signs of it. Ha ha he is as much Christian as Bin Laden is Muslim.
10692	Many wish he would not be president of the united states, but the reality is, if he does; then there would be great uproar. The American public would suffer, especially the working middle class and the lower bracket earners. The woes would just be unbearable.

10695	Any person should be treated equally regardless of their sex, race, ethnic background, economic or religious status. No one has a right to discriminate against you, or target you for scapegoating, because everyone matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
10696	No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords, what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not the color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job, you should not be judged by factors you were born with. No one has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Everyone matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is.
10697	On the issue of race, we should all accept that everyone is equal. Sex or race shouldn't impact someone's ranking, and nobody has a right to discriminate against you or target you for scapegoating. Every person matters, regardless of what you choose to do with your life. No one has a right to target you based on what you're born into.
10698	Every person matters, man or woman, physically fit or handicapped, whether of European, African, Asian or Native American, etc. ancestry, and everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is. This does not mean everyone deserves a vote in every race matter, but it should be expected that even if they cannot or will not have a vote on a particular decision that it will not be decided on the basis of the race of those making that decision.
10699	Being physical means that if you do not achieve the criteria for a particular job, that you are not only not discarded, but in fact you should be supported to pursue whatever goals you have regardless of your sex, race, age, height or anything else. Every individual should be entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
10700	It sounds like we are becoming communistic, trying to pass a law like that who does this country think it is to say what a person can or cant spend on food? It's helping our economy, there is more to obesity than buying too much food. Some obese people don't eat much, but what they are eating is junk and empty calories. Some try to buy healthy and get things like slim fast full of preservatives and poisons. Some just don't exercise, maybe we should pass a law for mandatory exercise! Health and nutrition classes. Maybe we should stop selling a bunch of junk, maybe we should make organic and natural foods more affordable.
10701	It is going to be difficult for the United States to control the production of food when China starts to produce more.
10702	People should not be obligated to spend on food if they do not want to. There is more to obesity than buying too much food.

10710	Well, a private attorney in a murder case is going to run you around $30-50 thousand dollars. So if you don't have that kind of money, you might not have a choice.
10711	Many people don't have that much money. They don't have much to spare.  In general, public defense attorneys are good.  Their main problem is they are buried in work.  This gives them less time to devote to even the most important cases.
10712	TV is a way of bringing you live news that you can't find in books, but because TV is expensive, the majority of people don't have it. For this reason, they do not have an option other than going to a public defender. It is not a particularly good lawyers, but it is better than nothing.  The main problem with public defenders is that they are overworked, and as a result, there is less time to devote to important cases.
10713	In general, public defenders tend to be decent attorneys and in terms of many legal issues they are just as competent as any other lawyer.  However, the main problem with public defenders is that they are overworked.  This gives them less time to devote even to the most important cases.
10714	Well, in a private murder case, the attorney is going to charge you between 30 and 50 thousand dollars. So if you don't have that kind of money, you might not have a choice.

This gives them less time to devote to even the most important cases.
10715	There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.
10716	Please don't be misled by the previous responder. Your question is not answered by calling your spouse and requesting a divorce, because your spouse may be evading family court law by avoiding the preliminary divorce proceedings. Your best bet is to obtain the address of the non-resident petitioner and call him directly.
10717	Even if he did find a person to have served your ex's by court order, that person may have no authority to work for a divorce petition if neither you nor the ex can be found. The legal term for this is "served in person" and it is important to be served in person. What is important to do is to initiate a civil lawsuit in your state so that your ex can be ordered to pay your child support obligations and even spousal support. Call your attorneys so that they can provide the appropriate legal advice as to what this legally means, how to initiate it and what remedies are available. This sort of thing is quite expensive to get in the United States. It is best to have your attorneys do this work for you.
10718	Your husband should file for a divorce as the family counselor was not able to locate him or could not obtain a court order to force him to surrender custody.
10719	If you haven't received a copy of the petition, you can't petition for a divorce until you get one.
10720	In which he may also be doing slander, but he's sending letters to you, so it's libel.  If you are serious about stopping him, start with the police. Libel laws vary from state to state, some states may not even be considered a criminal offense,   If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.
10721	First of all, what your stepson is doing is libel, because it is in written form. Slander is oral, which he may also be doing, but since he's sending letters, it's libel. In a few States if the message is less than 50 words you have no liability, but letters such as this are sent across the country and its a libel. If you're serious about stopping him, you start with the police. The police will have to report the libel. Libel laws vary from state to state, some may not be criminal matters in New York, and they will be able to tell you this. If it is a civil matter, speak with an attorney about bringing a case against your stepson and what a reasonable expectation of the outcome might be. It might not be worth the time, effort, and money involved if your stepson has no assets to lose, etc.

10725	Being kind is good, but not always effective as being selfish and annoying is usually a matter of career success. I hate seeing people who do a good thing for somebody and then take the good thing away from them. However, if life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hardworking people would get ahead and good people would not be poor.
10726	How is life fair? Sounds way too good to be true. If life were fair people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor. Although the system of justice is not perfect, it is a fair system that is used to punish corrupt politicians. Moreover, the system of justice does not always work but you cannot say the same about the system that is used to punish corrupt politicians. How people make a living and what they do with their lives is the result of decisions they make based on the social system of the place they live in. What happens in financial markets is the result of people making decisions based on the current social and political situation. Unfortunately, not all people make good decisions. However, it is very rare, and the people who are very successful are very successful because they chose to make the best decisions. The difference is that the people who do good things and get no return from it are called sympathizers, while the people who receive nothing good for doing bad things and get something nice in return are called altruists. What happens to profit and profits are not the result of poor decisions but the result of decisions. However, not all decisions are right or wrong. Some people decide and act and profit but their decisions or actions bring
10727	In certain situations you can be kind, compassionate and allow bad shit to happen to you but still be successful. Sometimes if you are hard working and do right by other people you may not get anything in return. I don't like that but I see it all over. If life were fair nobody would be poor, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not go to prison.
10728	In my opinion, if life were fair, people would not go to prison. Hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. I see it everywhere, employers or bosses that treat some stuff like shit but are financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return. I don't like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor.
10729	You can be a kind and compassionate person and bad shit will still happen to you.  You can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. I see it everywhere, employers or bosses who treat some stuff like shit, but are financially successful. People who do right by other people, but get nothing in return. I don't like it, but I see it often. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor.
10730	I've lost all hope for a progressive movement in this country. I've been defending him for 6 years, to all my conservative friends, in a very *very* red State, while he: kept the Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the Republican alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA.
10731	I'm angry about Clinton's stance on her views on certain issues. But now I don't have the strength to defend her. Why should a 25-year-old husk of a man listen to you?
10732	I'm going to vote for Obama because he is going to be a revolutionary leader and he will get things done unlike Hillary Clinton who wants a bigger world government and she will only be able to get some of things done. Please change my mind before I turn into a husk of a man or a woman
10733	Until i become a 25 year old husk of a man, i will defend Obama all the way....
10734	If I'm losing hope for a progressive movement I wonder why I am supporting Obama when he: kept Guantanamo open, bailed out the banks, passed the GOP alternative to single payer, kept the wars going in Iraq and Afghanistan, stood firm with the NSA, etc, etc.
10735	My love for bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general isn't just based on their adorable small nose. However, due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. If I was to recommend surgery to increase airflow, the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. The emotional anguish I imagine for owners struggling with every breath of air is disgusting.
10736	Let me begin by saying I love bulldogs, pugs, and dogs in general. However due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed, please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bulldog, but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons.
10737	I started loving bulldogs, pugs and dogs in general because I thought they were the most gentle breed of dog, only to realize that they are not. They are beautiful and amusing, but the reason I love these animals is because they are not aggressive. It's a choice to own them and it should be respected
10738	I'd like to see a law that if a bulldog or other designer breed in my care has been proven to have breathing difficulties I won't have to be responsible for them.
10739	There is no reason why people should be punished for having a designer breed.
10740	Through my experience as an undergraduate Engineering student I have found that the university environment is actually very uninspiring. Three years down the line you come to the realization that everyone is just passing by even here, we are all just trained to become another figure for an employment statistic for the department we are in and worst of all it feels like no one actually notices. For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed, and I really enjoyed it, and I didn't want it to finish. But it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity but instead it's just a production line for the corporate world.

Universities don't really care about educating us, or improving our knowledge. They are here to train us to how to behave, how to look a part, how to get hired and how to talk.Universities would make a lot of sense if it were used to provide free government services. 
10745	It is the responsibility of America to help anyone. If we do nothing to stop the genocide, we are viewed as uncaring or ignorant. If we go in and help people, it might look like we are playing imperialistic roles. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds.
10746	CNN was just showing a document about the Holocaust in school, and it says that the United States should have intervened. I think that the United States was right not to intervene. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this put us in a bad position because we are a superpower. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. If we go in, we look like we are being oil-seeking imperialists. So I don't think that the United States should be fighting other people's wars. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds!
10747	It would be good if the United States would intervene in the conflicts after the Holocaust. I think the US should have done nothing because if we had the chance of going in and taking part, then we might be seen as oil hungry imperialists. Also, if we helped other countries, we would look like a big, fat egoist because the world is under our thumb. We have to look after ourselves first before interfering in other countries. I would recommend you read about the role of the US in world affairs.
10748	We have been watching a CNN special on genocides after the holocaust. The piece believes that the United States should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the United States was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of the United States to help anyone. I feel like things like this, put the United States in a bad position. If we do nothing, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower.

10750	Healthy food is too expensive in my country. People complain that healthy food is expensive, and walk by the bag of carrot. Then they walk by the bag of celery. Finally, they walk by the bag of oats. Several pounds of food. For less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer, you can buy chicken breast for £48 per 10 kg. Buy ready meals for £2 each or worse. Then there are takeaways. I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain about healthy food being expensive.
10751	In my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive, then walk by the £1.00/kg bag of carrots, the 80p bag of celery, the £1.00/kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas... Several kilos of food here for less than £4. If you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months for less than £48.

10755	The entertainment and camaraderie are a benefit of sports, but I believe that could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up massive resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind. The huge amount of resources spent on sports could be spent on truly changing our society for the better.
10756	Feel free to change my view. I think that sports in general are a tremendous waste of time, energy and money and that they are a distraction from the things in our society that truly need our attention. I think far too much effort, manpower and resources, both mental and physical are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to truly change our society for the better.

10760	Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons - gut feelings, if you will. This can be seen in politics, where both parties justify their position in ostensibly rational ways. However, in most of the cases, in the end each party justifies their position with a gut feeling.
10761	Most people, most of the time, rather than forming an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons, a gut feeling, if you will. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds, although most political discussions end with both parties saying what amounts to "Your arguments are less convincing than mine." There is some "metacognitive" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.

10765	Still pretty silly that you would say that religion is a big problem with these issues, the issue here is we have more health issues today than we had back in the day. There have been other wars in the world, but in the last 100 years, the world has been able to solve all of these issues that plagued our world in the past.
10766	Religion is one of the reasons that there are wars in this world, because it is much better for religions to fight wars, as a means of spreading their religious beliefs, rather than advance the field of science.
10767	Religion does contribute to war, but more to an extent that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, et cetera. 
10768	Religion is important in stopping wars and diseases. The problem with it is that it prevents the spread of science and progress in society.
10769	Hope that didn't come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. But basically I was talking to my parents who are both vehemently religious and I made a realization that although religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem that religion is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, et cetera.
10770	Capitalism is very profitable to those in power, so it gets dictatorship by some people that I may not agree with in those societies. Socialism is a non-stigmatized, established and adopted system of sharing that allows each person to have equal benefits.
10771	The basis of capitalism is that the hard-working have a comfortable life and the non-hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by. According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. In socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life. You can try Capitalism, Capitalism, or Capitalism to find the pros of Capitalism.
10772	Under socialism, everyone has an equal income, but in capitalism, people are a little less free.
10773	Capitalism is better than socialism since capitalism has the beneﬁts of both. It’s based on the premise of free market and regular competition, in which people work hard to make money and enjoy comfortable life. Socialism per se is also founded on the idea of social justice but it’s more towards those living in the countries with less opportunities.
10774	    I believe that capitalism is better than socialism. The basis of capitalism is that the hard working have a comfortable life and the non hard workers have a relatively less comfortable life. Sometimes, the people with the less comfortable life work extremely hard only to scrape by.      In socialism, every single person has a relatively equal income. I'm not talking about Communism in which there is no currency or ownership, but a market in which everyone is free to spend but the poor are uplifted and the rich are taxed.      According to capitalists, socialism corrupts. Under socialism, ideally everyone should have an equal life, can you please try to CMV and offer good arguments for the benefits of capitalism?
10775	None of these fish suffered much in the beginning. They were only of minor importance in the catch. The worst part of this fishing event was in between making the grab, putting the hook in, and realizing you have no reason to stand there in the dirt in front of the fish fighting you and creating that scene. With that comes emotional suffering.
10776	I caught, faught, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.   In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish which we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and tossed them in to the water.   I cannot find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten.   At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.   I did not like it. Except... I did.  Fishers... Change my view?
10777	In order to catch those fish we first caught a lot of bait fish -- live fish that we caught the night before, then later jammed a giant hook through their still live bodies and threw them in to the water. I think that is bad. The fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. I dont like it. Except, I did. I think fishers, as a group, have a point that it is bad that they harvested the fish before throwing them in the water and now suffer while other fish swarm them.
10778	Captain... there are some human beings that follow you and become loyal to you when you have done a bad action. And what are you gonna do with them?
10779	Going deep sea fishing last weekend was on my invitation. We caught, battled, and then released some ten to fifteen fish.

10780	In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves, except Nigel Farage and other lone Tories that do stand up for the people of their nation. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further) and I doubt that anything will change from Gove's reign of terror - We may even see it get worse.
10781	The Conservative Party are all a bunch of selfish, money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves.

10782	There's a lot to be said for the Tories, they are very much in the business of protecting the rich and wealthy. Their ideas will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of this country, and not the average person. There's a very good chance that even with the Tories in office the academies and tuition fees will continue to go up.
10783	My opinion is that the Tories are all selfish bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves.

10785	In point of view, all rights are social constructs, and are produced from a variety of moral structures that is determined by a multitude of factors. However, all these rights can be removed in some way and are not intrinsically given to a human at birth. To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure. Please, CMV!
10786	I believe natural rights, i.e. *"...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."* do not exist.  I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth.  To clarify, I am defining a "right" as a guarantee of access to a commodity or state of being, without necessarily referring to a legal structure.  I believe that social constructs, as theorized by various philosophers such as John Rawls and John Locke, are inherently valid. However, the notion of what a "right" is is completely dependent on factors outside of its functional definition, such as context, cultural milieu, and power. However, such constructs are certainly limited and can also be overturned by the actions of human rights supporters.
10787	For all of us, it is human rights to have those rights which can be guaranteed with legislation or other forms of regulations, free of any kind of external moral constructs. Please, copy and paste!
10788	Isn’t it funny how nobody is going to feel bad about how their "don’t know" definition was influencing the direction of our conversation? They’ve got such low ethics that they don’t even take a breath before stuffing everything they say into their definition and arbitrarily redefining what constitutes a debate. No wonder they’re so worried about whether or not they’re right. In the future, people should pay more attention to their characters and habits. You don’t know what was in your past life.
10789	I believe natural rights, such as *"...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable..."* do not exist.
10790	An annoyance when watching videos on YouTube and Facebook that is common to everyone. The only reason I've been able to come up with is if the person recording only intends to always watch the video on the same device. But then why would you want a video that only intends to be viewed on a phone?
10791	I've always looked at someone recording a video while holding the device vertically as a mouth-breather. I know it is a very trivial issue but it just irritates me that someone doesn't take into consideration how the video will look later when it's being watched later on YouTube/Facebook/ whatever. Many times people end up covering 2/3's of screen with black bars, or even stretching &amp; blurring the sides. These videos always look terrible. The only reason I've ever been able to come up with is if the person recording only intends to ever watch it on the same device. But then why would you want a video that's only intended to be watched on a phone?

10795	It is my opinion that you should not be forced to vaccinate children unless they are at risk of contracting the diseases that the vaccinations are for. Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives. Some people do and the same thing happens. I would assume this is due to biology. Of course vaccinated people get sick and people who aren't vaccinated get sick. My conclusion is why should people be forced to vaccinate children if they do not want to. They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision and people should be satisfied with that.

10798	In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated.  Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives, and some people do and the same thing happens.  I would assume this is because of our biology.  Of course vaccinated people get sick, and people who aren't vaccinated get sick.   My conclusion is that there should be no vaccination unless a health professional believes in the effectiveness of it.  The people should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and they should make an informed decision.
10799	Its after some research and talking to friends and family that I personally learned how big the vaccinations and anti vaccinations topic is. In my opinion, it should be up to the parents whether or not kids get vaccinated. Some people don't get vaccinated and live long healthy lives, while other people do get sick and then die.  I would assume this is because of our biology. Of course, vaccinated people get sick and people who are not vaccinated get sick.  My conclusion is why should people be forced to vaccinate kids if they do not want to.  They should be informed of the pros and cons of their decision and make an informed decision and people should be satisfied with that.
10800	Neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a center of consciousness in the brain. There is no scientific basis to support the belief that death is just a black abyss.
10801	Neurologists have studied the brain extensively and have not found anything resembling a "center of consciousness" in the brain. This begs the question: external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness? We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness. Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent. So we really have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but philosophically it makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn. You don't have to believe in rebirth, but there is no scientific basis for either external or internal consciousness and no scientific basis for the belief that death is just a black abyss.

10805	In light of the screw job that recently befell Croatia vs. the host nation of Brazil, in the first round of the World's Cup, I am reminded of why I cannot stand Soccer (Football) please do not confuse this as an American trying to push the belief that American team sports are superior, because at its core I believe Soccer (Football) is one of the most beautifully dramatic sports. I was so excited when Germany beat Italy in the first round, despite the fact that I do not like Italians (I don't care what it says on the package).  I believe other countries find their national teams to be indescribably ugly.  If Germany is going to qualify, I am rooting for them to beat Nigeria in round two. I won't hold my breath. As for Brazil, I strongly disapprove of their reliance on chance actions like goal saving goal kick, since chances on goal saved kicks are about 2 out of 3. Consequently, if any other country beats Brazil, it has demonstrated an academic prowess of science. As for Brazil and Germany, their games are a non-stop bullfight. The only team not to be abusive or disrespectful toward their opponents is England.  This one I can understand, but when the second round begins, it's going to be a crucifixion. Whatever country wins, Brazil is destined to suffer for it and I very much have an asterisk lodged against them. Upon completing this task, I will be certain to embrace soccer as my sport and celebrate when I see any European team defeat any non European team. cmvm
10806	If Croatia was in the World's Cup, I would still not like it.  But I would love to see Brazil leave the World's Cup right now!

10810	He caused more destruction than any other person in history besides Hitler, Napoleon or even Islam. He brought great empires to their knees like the UK, Russia and France. He made Germany rise like a phoenix and get revenge on Versailles. He planned the autobahn. Also, what Hitler tried to achieve cannot be achieved at such a small scale. Only a nation in an advanced technological stage could make such a massive effort like the funding of modern intelligence technologies. But there is no evidence of this.
10811	As a country, Germany has more land that Napoleon or Roman empires. In a shorter amount of time, they conquered a lot more land. Germans brought their former empire to their knees. In comparison to the past, Germany is proud of the Nazis because they gained revenge for Versailles. The German Autobahn is an architectural masterpiece. I believe it wouldn't be different if the Nazis didn't commit genocide.
10812	Let's say that he continues with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at all to them. He conquered a lot more land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires like Russia, France and UK almost or to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.
10813	Moving the Jews to Madagascar is a good idea. In fact, he might as well bring the English to North Africa and move the Jews to Canada. It's easy and gives the Germans a free hand to conduct their policy of genocide. He conquered a lot more land in a shorter period of time than Napoleon or Rome. He also planned the Auto Alleihn, which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe if it weren't for the horrors of genocide Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.

10815	 I would've prefered to know instantly that my mom was coming home early, and **lying to me** would be a dick move because I felt sad about it longer than necessary. Also, I wouldn't want to get surprised in the first place. If I had learned that it would be great to get back to my house, but I have to wait some time... I'd rather have my secret known immediately rather than give my dog nightmares when it appears my mom is coming home early.
10816	Doing things that actually make one happy, well......That's just the way it works.
10817	Would anyone who has been surprised by a military family member please chime in?

Is it possible that humans think that rights exist because of a lack of social harmony in the group, or an influx of unpleasant circumstances. I personally think all human rights are a construction of the progressive human mind.  If natural rights exist at all, it probably occurs in a void mind in nature's universe. Like cats and dogs have rights, because they instinctively recognize their right not to get hurt. Also, that people should be responsible for their actions and get the consequences of their actions.
10821	There's nothing fundamentally wrong about the idea of natural rights but it only applies to what you consider the "in-group" - not the humanity as a whole.
10822	There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear good arguments as to why rights are not constructs.
10823	Each individual, every individual, has their own natural rights as much as their own natural life. For natural rights to exist, people in a large group must choose to extend the rights they have as people to their fellow group members.
10824	This idea that natural rights are universal and inalienable. I contend it is a construct. Natural rights are based on the concept of "existence" but only of "in-group" membership. If these rights are imposed upon humanity they would have to be constructed through action. Even within humanity, self-rule was at one time only granted to the "in-group". While there can be some appeal to human nature there is nothing in nature that causes rights to exist. I wonder what good arguments there are as to why rights are not constructs?
10825	No. The USA has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). The USA donates more money to charity aiding organisations than any other country. The USA tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying overall: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). The USA has most of the greatest universities in the world.
10826	So who is it? England? China? Make your case.   
10827	 The US is the greatest country in the world, second only to China. The US is the greatest country in the world because it has the highest GDP (domestic product). The US donates more money to charity or aid organisation than any other country in the world. The US is the entertainment capital of the world because there is more US made TV shows, movies, and video games than any other country in the world. The US has the most universities in the world.
10828	To answer your question: if the US was the best country for anything, the UK would be the best in that respect and the US would be the worse then. For example, if the US were the best country for the internet, the UK would be the best in that respect and the US would be the worst then.
10829	It should be noted that the greatest country by GDP is China, which donates more money to charity and aid organisations than any other country. What I mean to say is that the US has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, etc.). But in a far vast sense, these are secondary to the positive. It has the largest GDP, and the largest donation of charity and aid organisations. So I think that my point has been made and received my desired view.
10830	Between the two of these two Italian crooners, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambour, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was a aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martione. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Huesen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin even though neither of these two Italian crooners were jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians yet rarely have any of Dino's songs have.
10831	In my opinion, neither one of the 2 Italian crooners could give a realy gifted singer, They both had better vocal abilities and range but Dino's early singin influences were more of a Jazz sound and phase music sound and Van Huesen and Cahn were the best writers. He did have better phrasing and both had a knack for using space and timing and even though Frank did have more material and his songs are played constantly by jazz musicians,Dino wrote the best material. He had better phrasing anf singing better songs and he loved Nick Faraci like a son and influenced him to write, "Hey Mimi" They were both ahead of their time.
10832	Amongst vocalists, Francis can sing some tunes far better than Ardito and Dino. Francis has better voice range, better phrasing and better timing, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers were more blues and jazz based, Frank had better phrasing and better timing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martion, Frank also had better material especially from the mid 50s when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Huesen writing most of his songs, Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Frank much more than Dino.
10833	Neither Franco Berardi nor Ivo Martion were gifted singers with much in common other than their music was heavy metal 
10834	Neither one of these 2 Italian crooners were despise their success realy gifted singers IMO. Between the 2, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre, Dino's early inspirations, his model singers when he was a aspiring singer were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martin. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Huesen writing most of his songs.

10835	I'm amazed at how they haven't (more accurately, couldn't) permanently (more accurately?) put duct tape over Biden's mouth. The stupid things that come out of this guy's mouth, which include things that look like "he's saying 4 trillion dollar stimulus package is okay" just about every time he opens his mouth. Between an apparent lack of a real understanding of just how bad things really were and a congress that didn't even read the entire bill, there is a poor economic philosophy that would not resonate well with George W Bush or Bill Clinton and a bill that has so much pork in it that it could be a piece of Bill Clinton incarnated to legislation, this package is a terrible idea. YAY for the Barry-O and his lovely, lovely administration
10836	YAY for the Barry-O and his lovely, lovely administration.
10837	YAY for the Barry-O and his lovely administration. Between an apparent lack of a real understanding of just how bad things really were (read the article), a congress that didn't even read the entire bill, poor economic philosophy from the get go, and a bill that has so much Pork in it, it could be Porky the Pig reincarnated to a piece of legislation, this package is a TERRIBLE idea.

10839	Obama had better watch his mouth now that his much maligned much maligned father-in-law is impeached. Your momma advised him well to listen to something other than the truth
10840	We didn't impeach GW Bush, so why on earth did we impeach Clinton? All he did was get his knob polished, GW sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trash our name throughout the world. What Clinton did should have remained between him and Hill. Clinton is the worst president that we have, but it is not worse than GW Bush. All the great presidents have gotten their knob polished, and they didn't get impeached...
10841	We didn't impeach GW so why on earth did we impeach Clinton? All he did was get his knob polished, GW sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trash our name throughout the world. Clinton did what other great presidents did and he shouldn't have been impeached for his actions because the Senate has had a free vote to impeach him for years and he chose not to.
10842	As for Cheney shooting his friend, that is a trick and no worse than what other great presidents did.
10843	Clinton did nothing wrong for the country, he wasn't the leader of the country...why should he be punished for playing the presidency like most others? He only played the presidency like most others because he didn't use his power to actually improve this country.
10844	The reason we impeached GW so far as I know is because he sank us trillions of dollars into debt, started wars that have cost thousands of lives, and trashed our name throughout the world. In my opinion it is a clear violation of the constitution so it should have been impeached immediately...Compared to Bush and Cheney, Clintontype of thing is not so bad...See Bush was my pet terrorist so I didn't like what he did so I had to impeach him in the first place...Where did you hear Clinton's name?
10845	We are just people and if knowone likes the same sex relationships its theirs problem. I think that gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone so what's the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! You can argue and say that god made a man and a woman but I don't think that God would want you to be unhappy that's the main thing!!!!!
10846	We are just people at the end of the day and if knowone likes same sex relationships it's there problem. I think that Gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone so what the big problem. They should be happy and not live a lie! you can argue and say that god made a man and a woman but i don't think that god would want you to be unhappy that's the main thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10847	I'm on the side of the LGBT, but at the same time as Lesbians and Gay men are doing harm to the freedom of women and Men, so if you find it objectionable, than I'm on your side too.
10848	We are people, so at the end of the day it's just our lives, and if someone likes same sex relationships it's his problem. I think that gay and lesbian couples are not hurting anyone so why do they have to live a lie? They should be happy and not try to live a lie. They can argue and say that God made a man and a woman but I don't think that God would want you to be unhappy, that's the main thing.
10849	Yes, people are people, no matter their sexual orientation. Their sexual orientations should not affect their happiness and right to be happy. Lies should not be tolerated, and they should be told to stop living them.
10850	PCs and Mac's are different computers. Mac's use generic hardware and not specific apple hardware, as is often believed. People also believe that Mac's breakdown or need to be replaced less often than Pcs. If you ever work in an environment where Mac's are networked together and used as the primary computer, you will see that Mac's are just as perceptible to problems as Pcs. In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the 3 or so years they were used.

10855	In the Lion King, a Good Character actually dies, which gives the movie a much more serious and dramatic undertone than Aladdin. Besides my personal preference for drama!, this also makes the movie more layered and thus suitable for more kinds of people, which means there's a bigger target audience, which makes the potential revenue bigger. Plus, the Lion King got more Oscar Nominations than Aladdin, so there!.
10856	The movie is more serious and layered because a good character actually dies which gives the movie a much more dramatic undertone.

10860	Actually, a religious debate accomplishes a lot. In fact, both sides share many characteristics that make them very compelling and even attractive to both sides. The main problem is that a religious debate is often so heated and it can bring out true facts about a religion and accomplish a lot. However, in a religious debate, it can also make one side so ganged against another side that they neither can tell the truth nor express themselves.
10861	Yes, religious debates accomplish nothing. Instead, insults are passed back and forth and both sides are seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because either side invokes scientific or biblical evidence that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound. Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both sides have faults and unexplained oppenings of their own, so each side will just pick eachother apart.
10862	Neither sides are right or wrong. Instead of picking one side or another, each side should be objective in regard to what each other side believes and then refine their own belief afterward.
10863	Debating religious beliefs of each other doesn't accomplish anything and insults will be passed and both sides will get treated badly and each one picked apart in order to show their 'own faults and apparent openness' with the non-belief. Nobody will ever change his or her own beliefs because somebody quotes scientific and Biblical evidence that may or may not exist and may not even be absolutely reliable. Anyway both sides have fault as well as apparent openness and any attempt to change someone's beliefs simply end up being meaningless since each of these are wide open to logical debate. However, if you really think that one side is right and the other is wrong and some miracle really happens, wouldn't you think it would be just stupid for each side to not accept the evidence on both sides? Why do you think that was the case?
10864	We can never argue about religious views because it goes to the heart of the humans intetest for meaning. Each side will pick out people for spieling of propaganda and a pick who they think is better or support them own religious view.
10865	California is the best! - A land of opportunity - If it was a country, it would have the tenth largest economy in the world (as estimated by CIA). - Free from some of the kinds of hate/racism that you see in other states. - Contains some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. - Birthplace of technology and the new frontier for the modern world. - Good weather.
10866	The best is California, a land of opportunity. If it was a country it would have the tenth largest economy in the world (as estimated by CIA). Free from some of the kinds of hate/racism that you see in other states. Contains some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and destinations in the world. Birthplace of technology and the new frontier for the modern world. Good weather.
10867	California is the best! It is the largest and most economically powerful state in the country. It has many towns and cities with a favorable climate and economic outlook. It is a land of opportunity if it were a country. The city of Oakland is famous for having the best weather in the country, which is one of the reasons people are attracted to this state. It also has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes and scenic wonders in the world. New York City is the most beautiful city in the world, but the Californians did not like that opinion.

10870	It's G Z ED people!!! When you are talking to someone over the phone and you need to spell something that has the letter G Z ED, it's clear as day when you say G Z ED. If you're talking to a Yankee and are forced to say G Y E you get a lot of this "did you say V? Or was that a D?" Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
10871	That's why the alphabet song should be changed so that all people can get along.
10872	In New York when you are speaking to a Yankee you are forced to say ZEE and they say ZED but this is ZED people. Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
10873	There isn't any need to explain that Z is a vowel sound. The word ZED must be spelled with E. Maybe try a different approach to unify both alphabets. Not sure if it's a proper solution.
10874	When you're talking to someone over the phone and they ask for ZED you know you're in trouble and you need to say ZEE. If you're talking to a Yankee and are forced to say V you get a lot of "was that a D?" Let's change the alphabet song so we can all get along.
10875	Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy. If Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly, you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
10876	These accusations are too speculative for me to make a decision based on it. I can only go by the evidence.
10877	Of course it is. I would compare the situation with the lead up to the Iraq war. There are those in government who are making accusations, and then trying to build intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence. Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy. As for a lead up to the war, I think the same is true as well. There are those in government who are arguing about suspicion, and then building intelligence on the suspicious. Thus an assessment and an evaluation of the intelligence gathered would help people understand more about the given situation. English is a living language that is not dead or extinct. It is merely a language that is affected by modern technology and it is also affected by written book culture or media culture. I'm asking for a rewrite of the text. I'm making the full point that English is alive and it is not dead and extinguished. I should fix the grammar and the syntax rather than add tons of punctuation and typos and make others think that my entire position is flawed.  I would personally like to offer suggestions to your articles. There are numerous things which can be improved and we should discuss. I think I'm right to make the point that English is alive and
10878	If Israeli decided to preemptively attack Iran, you can bet that there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.
10879	That the U.S. and Israeli governments helped to build the technology that led to Iran's becoming nuclear armed. The nuclear strikes taken against Iran should warn us that our image in the eyes of the general public is deteriorating. Well if Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly, you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.

10885	Yes. Suicide (particularly of young people) is a drain on the country (education and the like). Also, it is a loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society. Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their lives then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. More work and thought should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a tragedy we CAN prevent.

10890	We see different colours all the time. Most of them are shades of other colours. For instance, the Rebecca Black Friday music video. When she is singing about how to-day is Friday, there is a weird and very exotic colour that appears on the screen.

10892	From a short distance, you can see different colours all the time. Most of them are shades of other colours. For instance, there are some amazing colours that come out when Rebecca Black's music video is being played. When Rebecca Black sings the phrase, "this is Friday," there is a very unique and exotic colour that comes up on the screen. I had never seen that shade of purple before in my life and I did not go crazy.
10893	In both cases the predominant colour is blue, but in the first example it appears differently, while in the second example it appears a bit differently.

10900	The US government seemingly recognizes a supreme being.
10901	Even though many atheists may be irritated by the motto on the dollar, I think it should stand. The US government seems to recognize a supreme being.
10902	Regarding the motto, I'll admit I like it and would have used it in this case. In fact, I have several suitcases with the motto on them. Despite the fact that many atheists may be irritated by the motto, I think it should stand. The US government recognizes a supreme being.
10903	How about we set the motto to say, "You actually think that's a good use of taxpayer money? I don't see a point in making a change from an economic standpoint. Your assertion is complex and difficult to address. You somehow manage to link a motto to both Islamic militants and the perceived moral bankruptcy of America. For people who are Christians, it's important for us to act like Christians with or without the stupid motto on the money. I imagine some Christian appreciate the motto on the money, I however could live without it.
10904	In point of view, any use of tax payer money to maintain religion is meaningless. In particular, I don't think people should be permitted to use it to maintain idols. That money would be better spent on social service programs that give others the chance to have a life.
10905	Management of the organization is inefficient if it does not ensure that all the policies are consistent and beneficial to the agents.
10906	The agent will fall in line with the company, if they are not doing what is good for them, and if management is creating the strategy they need to come up with another plan. Unless the power from within the workers and management kick in, they need to come up with a strategy they can implement.
10907	AGENTS. This is effin' callcenter. Its should already be a cliche. Even though management is the one creating the "strategy" if it's not favorable to the AGENTS, then the management is useless, they need to come up with another plan... unless the "power" kicks in that AGENTS won't be able to do anything but to freakin' follow.
10908	My opinion is that it should be two people instead of just one person... and you must have a strategy. Even if you want the CEO's to introduce something, the AGENTS must be given to go along with that. If the CEO's don't want it that way, then it will fail.
10909	AGENTS are fantastic. This is incredible. Agent communication is a phenomenal way to organize companies.
10910	If you hold religious beliefs and promote them as absolute truth, you need proof to validate your claim. If you refuse to give your fellow man the proof you're hiding the truth from him or her. You are hindering his or her ability to encounter the truth, and quite frankly, if they were to die afterward and be condemned for eternity is their blood not on your hands? You had the means to save them but didn't. If you can't offer proof of your beliefs, that's ok, just don't promote it as truth, promote it as belief.

10915	Evolution has been backed by science, including DNA tracing, and by archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution simply states that species can evolve to adapt to their environment. Humans have evolved mostly from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof. Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
10916	Throughout the 20th century it was the establishment that was scientifically backed that said there was no evidence of any form of evolution. Yet both DNA analysis and archaeological work has shown evidence of human evolution. These studies have put the evidence for evolution well above the evidence for creationism, which it is very hard for many people to comprehend.
10917	Science has backed the theory of evolution including DNA tracing and archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment. Humans have evolved most likely from apes because our DNA is similar to theirs and our behavioral patterns are similar. These are things like using tools to find food. While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what most people use the term. Most people say "theory" about things that haven't been proven and there is a lot of doubt. This is not the case. A scientific theory can only become proven true when everything is discovered about it. Gravity is only a scientific theory and a theory of relativity as well. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof. Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.

10919	There is evidence that evolution can be backed by science including DNA tracking and by archaeological findings such as Lucy. Evolution just states that species can evolve to adapt to their environment. Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food. There is NO scientific theory called 'creation'. It is the fault of people like Milton Free who call for proof of their theory that there is uncertainty and doubt about their very theory. We can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism.
10920	My date had prime rib and I had a burger with 3 different types of meat in it I believe. My date loved the prime rib and her mashed potatoes and my burger was cooked to a perfect medium. In fact the burger was incredible, just writing this review makes me want to go get another now. Only downside I would have to say was the Mac and cheese. I did get to speak with the manager and it's a new item and they are working on the item. We r definitely going back!

10925	This place feels like the Canadian part of an old film set. Has an excellent feel to it. I have had a few dishes here. The lobster roll, PEI mussels and boneless back rib burger are all recommendations. The daily noodle is a bit rare, however, I have missed it all three visits. Next time when I go back I will be sure to have some of this daily noodles for a change.
10926	One of my favourite spots is the western burger here. The atmosphere is pretty cool, almost like you're in a wooden cabin. The burger was good. The daily noodle though is scarce - I've missed it all three visits. Sorry. Perhaps next time, though I will certainly be going back.
10927	Cool atmosphere... like your in a wooden cabin. Fits in excellent with the Canadian 'comfort food' theme. I've had a few dishes here, lobster roll, PEI mussels, and boneless back rib burger, all of which I'd recommend. The daily noodle is scarce, I've missed it all three visits. Alas, perhaps next time, as I will surely be going back.
10928	Fun atmosphere like a cabin but it's softer. fits in perfectly with the Canadian 'comfort-food' theme. The dish I had was PEI mussels which was very good, except that it was too spicy for me. I think that depends on how you like your food. This is a place you can go for a nice meal without having to spend too much money. I'd recommended this place to some people but they've never come back for the noodle, but that's about it.
10929	There's no great atmosphere, even though the place feels like you're in a wooden cabin. The comfy beds were all that stood out. The food has many individual dishes which are all serviceable but there was nowhere to serve drinks or even salt and pepper. They only have a do-it-yourself coffee maker so it's refreshing to be able to find something like this on vacation
10930	Went in on a Monday night and there were several servers there but none came to even take our drink order until 15 minutes later. The manager came by at one point and asked how we were doing as he walked by but he asked and kept walking. Why ask how I'm doing if you clearly don't care or want to know why, which is evidenced by the pace of your gate around the restaurant. Mind boggling!
10931	Went in on a Monday night. There were several servers there but not one came to even take our drink order for 15 minutes. Manager came by and asked us how we were doing as he was walking past but he asked and kept walking. Why would a guy ask how someone is doing if he clearly doesn't care or want to know why, which is evidenced by the speed of your door pulling around the restaurant. This guy was a joke! This manager is a joke!
10932	Before going in, there were several servers at this table, however none came for about 15 minutes to take our drink orders. Then the manager came by, asked how we were doing, and he asked for our orders and he kept on walking. What's the point of asking if you don't care or want to know why which is clearly evidenced by the pace of your gate walking around the restaurant? Mind boggling!
10933	The manager came by at one point to ask how we were doing and he asked, but he didn't care and kept walking. He's not taking care of his business.
10934	Meant to just leave and never return. Upon my return, I was left crying because I didn't like the place. The food, obviously, is delicious but the service was...well, it didn't help. I guess.
10935	Food was amazing, our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us, she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account, I had a $50 charge. I would have gone back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!
10936	Our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. She was very attentive and didn't push us out to the second row even though we wanted to wait. She made sure our ice water was refilled each time. She checked in with us and went to the waiter without leaving our table. I would give her an extra $3 tip on our drink charge. Our bill was $47 and some change and I left a $10 cash tip on our check. Our account had a $50 charge after the tip. I should have asked to see the confirmation and went back with a written question. We didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!

10940	Probably the best and most authentic Thai food I've had in Arizona (Tried 2 curries and Pad Thai) But that's not why I gave this place 5 stars. After my girlfriend ordered her curry a little too spicy for her taste (and ate a good amount), we asked the waiter if he could lessen the spice and he left to the kitchen only to return with a brand new curry (and rice) cooked with less spice. Oh and we got free ice cream! How cool is that??!
10941	It is really a bit unclear what is the 'authentic Thai' food here, because reviews are mixed on the curry. But in general, I would say the food is nice and they do have free ice cream.
10942	After my girlfriend ordered her curry, we asked the waiter to change it and he left to change it, and came back with a new curry and rice.   Oh, and we got free ice cream! How cool is that!?!

10945	You shouldn't have to wait more than an hour in a crowded restaurant for food that the staff realizes the food should be made fresh.
10946	There was not much people at this restaurant and it was a little bit slow. The staff was busy I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, it wasn't very good.  Don't order the Mushroom Stroganoff. It was not edible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were very tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it wasn't fun.
10947	The place was not busy and the staff was overworked, so they didn't have enough food to serve you. The food that we were given was so slow that the sauce was not cooked properly. Don't order the mushroom stroganoff. It was disgusting!
10948	Food service was very slow and the servers over worked and didn't seem like the type to get back to you if there was anything wrong. I recommend going in the lunch hour when things aren't as busy or order online ahead of time.
10949	Just not a good experience here. The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked I guess. The food when I came out 1 hour later, was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff. It was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
10950	This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very disappointed in the food portions for the price point or maybe I'm just bitter that this place took over Messinis. I gave one star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (Messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7. I will always try a new place once, unfortunately I would not recommend this place or go back again.
10951	High expectations were not met due to failed expectations, big shoes to fill had failed expectations, food portions for price point would fail to meet expectations, missing items in the take out order would be hard to justify and leave a bad impression, the juice was good, but it better be if it cost $7. I will try a new place once and hope that things will get better. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place again.
10952	For the price point, I was extremely disappointed in the food portions. I gave one star because I had high expectations and it failed, it had big shoes to fill (messinis), food portions for price point failed, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.
10953	TV has a better judgment of food portions than Messinis.   I gave 1 star because I had high expectations = fail, it had big shoes to fill (messinis) = fail, food portions for price point = fail, missing items in my take out order, the juice was good but it better be if it costs $7.  I will always try a new place once. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place or go back again.
