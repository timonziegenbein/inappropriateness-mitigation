The TV shows bores most of us who are not bad readers. We get hooked on soap operas and lame rom coms. TV is dumb and absurd and boring. We think its good that...
12	I have to summarize. TV is bad, the internet is worse; books are best. books give you magic, they'll make you feel very alive and they're going to put you out of your element. These quotes do not show kids expressions, it's the 20th century that creates thought; that it's very, very important to take care of them, to teach them..
13	Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine.
14	Books never destroy the morals of children. They change the moral of the reader. And television are a lot of unreality and violence. Fahrenheit 451...don't get into the details but reading it has made a huge difference in my life and has helped me to see the world in a whole different light....

The fatherless kid had a great Father's Day message. http://simmonstein.com/news/2009/12/giving-happy-fathers-day-to-my-fatherless-kid-the-8-lessons-his-half-s father taught him from 14-17
21	Honestly I'd rather be completely fatherless, not that it is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).
22	I do not think that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model. Take my self as an example, I grew up without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). Just for fun: you can grow up without a father and still be successful (Self-opinion)
23	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having a lousy one, and don't believe that... I did turn out very successful. As opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I did turn out... well, it was really more than success.
24	That's true. I'd rather be completely fatherless, but I do believe you can grow up without a father even without a male role model, and that you can still be successful. I am a very good example. I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great.

35	Of course Firefox leaks memory like a sieve. I wonder why my battery life hasn't decreased since I installed Firefox 2.0.0.1. I try to use Firefox 1.5.1 as much as I can, but I can't stand the amount of memory it leaks.
36	The Firefox browser uses 250 Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows when three tabs are open. The tools in Firefox shouldn't be the reason why you shouldn't be using it. Firefox has many great tools and plugins. If you still don't know how to use them, they should be the reason why you shouldn't be using them.
37	That's why I'm using Firefox 2.0.0.1 on Ubuntu 11.10. It uses only 200 meg of memory!
38	Because Firefox leaks memory. I would recommend trying a different browser, for instance Chrome or Safari. You will not be able to install the extensions in these browsers.

45	Having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way).
46	It is also true that having a father is better for a child, but that being said you should not substitute poor treatment for a father. Having a father is very important and even hard to get. People can change.
47	Yes, having a mother and a father is the healthiest thing a child can get. Of course, some people make bad choices, and these same people should be counseled by a family therapist, rather than by a simp. Who says that he will be lousy forever?

70	Thats true, the government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. The government DOES have that right. The steps we would take could not be even listed in here. The government has taken an ongoing series of steps to punish prostitutes, drugs, prostitution, and displaying naked bodies in public, and for more than two thousand years, the government was doing it.

72	The government does have that right. A woman CANNOT legally prostitute herself in many states. The woman can take illicit drugs in her own body......she is not to kill anyone, nor display naked...nor is it even covered by morality. A woman should be free to do ANYTHING, including show their naked body.
73	The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever. The government DOES have that right. 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others .......... The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME.
74	Women do not have a right to go around seducing men for their own sex, nor do they have a right to take drugs in their own bodies. They do not have the right to display their own naked bodies in public. The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME.
75	No. If it is not a living body then there is no such thing as a baby in her stomach.

80	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Many who don't want it to be allowed just don't like homosexuality all together. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever...
81	No, but I do think that gay marriage should be allowed. My thoughts... Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. As you know most people don't like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
82	Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Many people, just don't like homosexuality. On the one hand, they tend to be prejudice. On the other hand, gay couples should be allowed to be happy with each other.
83	Yes, I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Most who don't want it to be allowed, simply don't like homosexuality, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever, why shouldn't they be allowed to get married.
84	I believe gay marriage should be allowed, especially because homosexuals are unable to understand why. Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just don't like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married?
85	I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't. you should always do what is right. You will be judged by the consequence of what you do. You will be judged by the consequence of what you do. One thing that really weighs on people's minds is whether they respect other people. You will be judged by the consequence of what you do.

Definitely not much use for it.

90	Yes, jail has company benifits. If he had contributed to society, then he would not be in jail. He chose to commit crimes. That is his mistake and his time should be used to serve his sentence and to make a better...
91	No, you can not start a health care if you go to jail, as is the beauty of the USA.  Why would it change if you were jailed and the rest of the public had to pay their hard earned money into taxes?  You brother is in jail for a reason, but if he had contributed to society instead of commiting crimes he would not be in this situation.
92	The government should offer health care. It's a major drain on society, a major drain on resources, and a major drain on everyone's pockets. Why should it change if you have to go to jail? You brother is in jail for a reason. Jail has no company benefits.
93	No.  That is the beauty of the USA, you have no health care. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes.  You brother was in a jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in this situation.
94	I do not think jail would give him company benifits and neither does the government. he should be in jail, probably for a lengthy period and cause the december 2011 election to go back to the people that deserve them.
95	Congress has a constitutional right to spy on all US citizens, which includes listening to calls and text messages. However, if you live in California, the police can forfeit your vehicle after fewer than three incidents.... Because of whom? The people who make the call every day.

Last time we decided to listen. If you're against Bush, he's on the other side of the fence. We're on the other side. He's against oppression.

103	I think Che Guevara was right; oppression will always exist, regardless of attempts to stamp it out. There is still oppression in the world. As long as oppression exists, there is a thirst for freedom from it. I think we should all work towards a society where oppression is the exception rather than the rule.
104	Che Guevara. He once wrote, "you can kill a man but you cannot kill an idea". In the same vein, oppression can be cast aside in order to create a new world. The basic conditions apply as in the days of Che.
105	Yes, you brought up an interesting point. I would like to challenge you with a broader point. That our laws reflect morality and their action has such an important moral moment in our civilization. This is a really big question that invites reflection of our intent. In fact, in some cultures, the law already does, and it reflects morality....or at least...go with your own heart!
106	"The Holy Spirit teaches us that we see physical evidence of the Light's work but it is all too difficult to understand and sometimes even...wrong."  ### Question:...What is the moral message of this? "The Holy Spirit teaches us that we see physical evidence of the Light's work." Do you agree? Yes, because the Holy Spirit also...answers any questions. No, because the Holy Spirit also teaches God's message, the Truth.
107	Whether or not you think our laws reflect our morality, that does not...if your are in the state of California your must obey the Vehicle Code.  The CV Code very specifically states that there is a fine penalty for a violator. The penalty is that the bicyclist will be forfeited if he/she is negligent in a traffic accident and if so the victim's umbrella will not be covered under the "statute of limitation." so the victim will be left liable for the aforementioned loss in a civil lawsuit..... if you actually know your Law (Code), you can calculate that the driver of the car and the bicyclist would both still be liable, but for not placing the umbrella under the umbrella.... Then you would want to call the police to find the traffic accident and the bicycle. In a civil suit... ....the laws are stated in...California Vehicle Code section 14607.14....and its predecessor, and is familiar because it was "repeated two times in two different states." That generally is the reason why it is not in the law.
108	I think that morals can indeed be... shaped by society. To me faith can inform policy because without it, you cannot form it yourself. I could not care less about the wrongness of things like urban decay and the disregard for unions. I'm sure there are many times when morals get in the way of morals. Morality is a... fine line. But morals actually can be different depending on culture.
109	There is nothing like taking his own view on anything. Morality and law are two very different things and we don't have to agree on... The problem with the example of the lady that wants to give her child into adoption is that there is no evidence that she is going to want to raise the child, so in fact, it would be the child's responsibility to give her up. I don't agree with that. In a pluralistic society and in fact in a society that is more pluralistic than its preceding society, one person's opinion should not take over the laws.
110	Reason why she is giving you a restraining order "I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so I would tell but then again I wouldn't."
111	She should leave because she left when she had issues with him and needs to take care of her. She has many more reasons why she should leave as she considered him a mean, drunk man with no concern for the... "Restraining order does not keep a man away from her. He can't hurt me any longer," She had to take a restraining order so that she wouldn't see him anymore. Such is her feelings. "Maybe he is right, so she needs to leave him. She's so mad. She wants to kick him out now."
112	Someone who never would hurt me... Someone who would never leave me because... Someone who would never hurt me in any way, not even on purpose. I'd like a restraining order to keep my partner, if and when he decides to hurt me. In addition to being a lot more friendly and reliable, such order could also protect me against bad behavior.
113	If she really can't get over you, then she needs to get over you for good. Certainly, such a court order could work in her favor. She wouldn't want to leave you. That's how I see it. She left you for good. She changed your relationship for good, and she doesn't have to see you.
114	To protect their heart, one would be better off getting some type of court order to restrain from contacting the person in question. "I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person..."
115	Killing someone with a defibrillator is a horrible idea and horrible as a justice system makes it all seem very disingenuous, it's all about pushing an agenda and making money. Even an innocent person is guilty that the judge, jury and prosecution can make out. Why let something not be judged fairly? even if a case is not properly tried. and punishments that are not in proportion to the crime.
116	1. reduces crime through framing of the crime and case law. 2. the adversarial system encourages well-thought-out arguments - it's fairer. 3. allows a balanced examination of evidence - of course it's a deceptive system if it actually favors certain sources of evidence instead of others. 4. gives parties a chance to present their case without the court being able to dictate to them 5. if all the arguments were really well... none
117	It allows people to resolve their problems their own way and... that's a great thing. It takes away the judgment from the state and allows people to air their... concern on the... truth. It allows for a fair trial. It helps to break down prejudice.  What are the arguments against this system?.... it increases disparity..... it allows people to solve their problems their own way and it is not unfair..... that it doesn't allow for presentation of... evidence or argument and it doesn't have emotion.... and with emotion the... judge really... makes... judgment.
118	1. the adversarial judicial system allows us to try to present the truth without fear of jeopardizing one's reputation if found guilty based on this false assumption that a defendent is a liar, which is half true.  2. It seems that the jury deciding which argument is better is more likely a poor method because jurymen do not need to have the expertise to do this sort of thing, which is a concern.  3. both sides are allowed to present false evidence in order to hide their own untruths...
119	No, the adversarial judicial system does not help to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented that the facts of a case. The jury, who are basically untrained people decide which argument is better seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth.

Even so, I enjoy them. with the race car it makes them amazing on all sorts of terrains. Even the beach. The big downside is you can't flips easily. With the bike I love the dirt bike and the steam bike. With the bike I love the dirt bike and steam bike.
121	The race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. C'mon! ...daddy, the... daddy, the... ...daddy, the... ...daddy, the... the... the... daddy, the... the... ...daddy, the... the... ...daddy, the... ...daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the... daddy, the...
122	Last chance to say what I just said. The money maker, the best vehicle. On the beach the down force keeps you down but it also goes up hill. On highway and rollercoaster, you have to be careful if you do a back flip. On the Beach the dow force keeps you down on the big hills but on the rollers coasters it's even worse. The bottom being so much higher than the cars, so make sure to stay in the middle and always do a flip back and forth.
123	I assume the race car is more superior because its tailor made for the map you choose as well as the one it was designed for. The bike's problem is it's so flipping on uphill slopes, whereas the race car is made for those... thanks for the support :) CMV! Thanks... ! CMV! ...thanks for the support:). CMV! .Sorry... sorry... it's late: ( CMV! These are new rules; i mean new rules: Get back on the roll . CMV! CMV! : D CMV! CMV! ... gets back on the roll . CMV! CMV! CMV! CMV! CMV! CMV!
124	The state of California has stricter rules on when to wear a helmet. However, if someone drives a motorcycle that doesn't have a helmet, they should wear one. With the motorcycle, however, they should wear a helmet while they are working, especially on runs. One of the biggest downsides of the motorcycle is that the stance is pretty much... your typical stance for the bike, with your feet on the pedals and your feet on the brake bar with your arms folded over your back and your elbows in your back.
125	I want to know why they are helpless because 8b is the budget for the Homeland Security, and I am sure as hell that no $ could come close to it. I always felt it was just a ploy to say wow...$8b can be spent on other things like mobile security devices, keyboard tappers, pen tappers, malware, any malware, and any bribes. No other ideas besides $8b? Why don't we move $8b to the Homeland Security? And the other $8b it would do great things to... Restrooms all over the world, schools, libraries, care, mobile security, $100. you would save $8b... I would spend mine on other things like my son, my dog, car, and my family! CMV
126	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com) It...because real humans have evolved since then. First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay!
127	If I have to choose, I like the official version because it lets people know that the school uniforms protect students from unfair hatred and violence, and only those with the safety and rule of law should wear them, i.e. not...condoms.I...tell you what i go to school in reddit i am in school in ithaca t...i know, because reddit users are idiots. and reddit is a good site that people can feel free to post there, and people feel free to respond to them. i... go to school in reddit t... i want to defend the USA no need for flag. i think reddit is a wonderful site, i... a reddit user i am a very active reddit user i i am a reddit user i go to school in ithaca I always... go to school in ithaca I always i always go to school I would always go to school in iathaca even if I had a car. I always go to school even if I had a car.
128	In a way I have nothing against the law, but the way it is implemented is more important. Also in a way it does play a purpose and is good, and would save lives. But due to the complaints, it is being even more clumsy. Its too small, being too complex, it is only for protection and overspends, so not to people having money or making money. Point taken. Indeed. In a way no one seems to agree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. In a way, you seem to be going too far with the reddit comments, though. In a way, it may look like you are asking for a reason, so I would try to to clarify it. I... know that your position may seem to be incorrect, but I do think that your point is likely to be completely wrong. It may not be just a misunderstanding, but indeed it is misunderstanding.
129	America is great and so are its people. They're all greedy and self-seeking. When Congress has a package to pass, they can get away with it. Congress gets paid for members, and members get paid for their job, so there's not much of a reason to remove it. But it keeps being removed. Congress thinks it serves a purpose. Congress thinks it serves a purpose. Congress keeps it. It's good, so... it keeps being removed. So it's still kept.
130	Now I see that they are more likely to start believing in magic and a chance to really know if you are really in love, since... I was under the impression that a man's strongest love was his first love. After getting separated from your first love, your... I now look at love as a two-tier process: The first love being the "fairy tale" love that you start believing in as you grow up. The second love being real, except it's only trustworthy for a limited time.
131	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com) really do help me view things better. It makes it so that I can view things in a non-biased manner. I base much of my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever.
132	I am just under the impression that the best thing...Maybe love is not the best thing.....maybe it is more realistic as it is supposed to be. I base my view on the belief that after separating from your first love the veil falls and your naive beliefs about love go away forever...about the main thing you have to know is that love is not all that...or that...
133	For the first time, I really believe that a man's first love is his strongest love and every following love is a bit weaker each time. That being said, some users may want to disagree and be left with the belief that a man's first love is a total disaster that basically makes women unreliable towards men....RND.
134	My first love is my last love, while a man's first love is his strongest love. That second love, however, is definitely about wanting to match the intensity of the first love, but with a greater degree of aggression. That second love is definitely a little like chasing the dragon after taking a drug, like coming after my first love after she separated from me and doesn't believe in love anymore, but also like chasing a dragon after taking a drug, where you are chasing a [dragon] that is taking a drug and is not believing in love anymore.
135	No, it won't recover - we only recently recovered from the Great Depression. Let's remember we were the fastest rec...ing recovering economy in that part of the world during the '70s. We need to act quickly so we don't go back down the same roller coaster....
136	I wish lawmakers HAD TO take at least some relevant history while in high school. If they don't it's too late. I... they will serve a stinky, lay off notice and get tossed into the workhouse.... if they are homeless....
137	Yes, it WILL recover - PROVIDED the government stops its meddling and 'bailing out' measures. It's things exactly like this that turned the potentially temporary market drop into a huge and horrid 'Great Depression'......and as part of the 'measures' then instituted were some of the Union Laws which are STILL crippling our ability to be competitive......(italics mine)
138	The United States government has had a huge impact on our culture, and they (including the Catholic church) have learned very little. By extension, so do lawmakers...I'm fed up with the 'I'm just saying' mentality. We can't all live in the 18th century...
139	Oh yeah, I do... The Obama 'bailout' that cost the American economy $27 billion in lost growth and jobs....the same damn 'bailout', which is still crippling our economy. When did the US GDP grow at 1.9% during the Great Depression, vs the Obama's 'bailout?'
140	There are many great pizza delivery services in Southern California. Now Del Taco is like Taco Bell; it's like Taco Bell even to further disgust anyone who's not in the know. I don't want to add in any new information to this post but I'm dropping a link that explains the difference between Taco Bell and Taco Fell in great detail.
141	In my opinion, taco bell is not serving meals to good guys. Its junk food, and its not good for you. I'd rather cook and sit down for real food. I used to cook for my wife too and i'm done for the moment.
142	SoCal has pizza delivery services until 3am, but I also prefer to eat taco at Taco Bell than at any other Mexican restaurant. I don't know where you live, but here in SoCal we have pizza delivery services until 3am, plus I would rather go to Del Taco than to any other Mexican restaurant.
143	Taco Bell serves pizza delivery services until 3am. A much more affordable alternative to Taco Smell and Taco Hell. It also offers samplers at a lower price than the regular tacos. Why are tacos 5 for a buck back then?
144	In our high school days, Taco Bell was 5 for a buck. I've seen pricey restaurants have good pizza, but we've only recently tasted so many options....deltaco is reasonably priced. Taco Bell has decent prices and even though it claims to be healthier, in our opinion, they don't seem so.
145	If you want a fair debate, open to all members of the community, then put them on a common thread. Remove the debate platform if need be. It wasn't put there for people to make political statements, especially as the rules warn them. I hope that those interested in the debates find them. the problems associated with having debates open to all are too many -  too many social media people post debates; too many people with their thumbs down; too many comments from angry people knocking things down and calling this op a neg; too much time spent on a very incoherent discussion; too much time spent on calling people names, no one having a real discussion in which many people took turns making accusations and calling names; too much time spent on a very incoherent discussion;...many people who took insults and to others used insults, many having re-posted what others had posted, even though no one ever did, not even in my presence...
146	Both very good tips. I have not heard about many of them - and I'd like to participate in the debate. Be considerate if you feel someone is 'pushing others down'. It is absolutely normal for... ...people to put their own...points in front of others'. In the debate, arguments always have to put their own points and advantages...at the same...time and supporting evidence. It is commonplace to only read or respond... to other...arguments but not to... arguments put in front of other...arguments.
147	I get it! The running average for the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day, the maximum posted per day is probably the reason behind it. Many people are putting time and effort into the current open debates. Again, this is a big reason why I prefer Firefox. Last but not least - if you'd enjoy the debate, then I'd really appreciate it. The running average for the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day, the maximum posted per day is probably the reason behind it. Many people are putting time and effort into the current open debates, and this is a big reason why I prefer Firefox.
148	Yes. Right now the maximum submitted per day is 8 or 9. I think things need to return to being able to have a maximum of 20 or so people contribute to a discussion at one time. With that many things to cover, keeping up with the numbers is difficult. This is also a thing of progress as no one can offer 25 reasons for why they love Firefox and make 20 links of what they love about Firefox. There's an easy way to help others do this. open debate.
149	Really, yes. Around 20 were created yesterday (the 12th). The running average in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day. There should be a maximum posted per day, possibly having someone elses to wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something like that. Give people a chance to read current ones.
150	The veal sandwich wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. The baked goods were just okay. The lemon meringue and the cannolis were ok. The food was disappointing.

151	This place isn't nearly as good as it used to be, probably because the owner has gone haywire. Good luck with your refund. There were too many slices of pie, and too much shredded cheese on the veal, as well as a big amount of left-over tomatoes on the veal. I would like to know more about the baked goods. I'd like to know if they were good, especially the lemon meringue. The whole veal was unappealing. The baked goods were okay. The veal was unappealing, and the onions were unappealing.

152	It was okay but not worth my time. There was a lot of condensation in the fridge, and the batter made me think it wasn't baked onsite. There was also a lot of unappealing looking cake batter scattered in there. I wouldn't go back. Will not try again. Won't be going back. won't go back. Won't go back. Won't go back. Won't go back.

153	Not as good as expected. I can't really comment on the taste, but the sandwich was unappetizing and liquidy. The baked goods just looked unappetizing. The lemon meringue and cannolis were also unappealing. I don't know if they don't bake onsite. the only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis. This place may not be worth giving a try. I will not be giving it a try. The veal sandwich was not what I was looking for. The baked goods were unappealing and the tomato sauce was liquidy.
154	Not good. I would give it 2 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough. The baked goods were either bad or plain. The veal was a big tough piece of meat that tasted weak and tough. The onions had a strange taste as well. The tomato sauce was liquidy and kind of watery which makes me think it wasn't made with tomato paste. I'd give it 2 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough. The tomatoes were liquidy and soggy. The onions tasted strange as well. The tomato sauce was liquidy and soggy.
155	Well, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle, and I love the amount of skin customization and Toolbar customization that this version of Firefox supports. All the grease Monkeys and most of the Toolbars seem to get the point. So... From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. So...
156	Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. And since IE7 is such a horrible looking UI, I will never use it.
157	Firefox's a pretty good browser if you like skins and customization. Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE? The unfortunate truth is IE (7 is the most criminal of all of them). ... next block. Yahoo isn't accepting JPG images, but they are accepting PNG. Yahoo is also now becoming a bit of a goner to those of us who use Safari and X...
158	The discussion is irrelevant and un productive. Using Firefox beats IE by a considerable margin....IE sucks. You'd have to read this message with a binocular to make out what is actually being discussed. I've used Firefox for quite a while. It's definitely superior to IE from a design standpoint. Further, since I personally don't use much of my Intraweb, I'm not too concerned about my branding here. Firefox definitely wins the Pretty Browser battle.
159	Firefox has so many great features that the Pretty Browser battle is lost. And since most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. So no one has to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE.

165	I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly loved someone, you would do everything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. though, if he killed someone just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because i wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.

169	An accident has nothing to do with the fact that you love someone. Its more like if you got in a fight with the person and got hurt. Even if you loved him, you would still be upset. Since you got hurt, you probably shouldn't ride his motorcycle, and that's the way I feel. I wouldn't want to stand in the way of someone who doesn't know what he's doing and just loves someone.

175	Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people, which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex.

183	It is...kind of...UnChristian. What you must understand...is that most humans would rather judge others' lives instead of sharing with them any more of their experiences, sharing truth with each other.

217	Yes, India is on course to become the greatest economic power of the world. It is only going to take them a few years to surpass the U.S., but it seems certain.

221	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot of other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
222	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, because its a very serious issue, having parents spank their children is humiliating to them and to their children and instills fear in children for a long period of time, making them...

225	Yes, i will turn him in to the police. I will do it even if it hurts.But i don't care because i love him and i know who he is... and how could he be telling a lie to me or i trust him...i do.
226	Yes, i will turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.
227	Yes he should be made to take part in a murder, and it is sin. Besides, he can feel guilty for what he has done, and he can try to stop it from happening again. And... if he confided in me, he might kill me for someone else in the future. So... by confiding in him, it doesn't make him clean and innocent.
228	In point of view, if you confide to him, he can't be telling you a lie about why he is going to kill you, or why he is going to kill someone else. Because all that information doesn't make him clean and innocent; and if he actually did commit a murder, he is a murderer.
229	The only person who can look someone in the eye and say I trust him is only God. And if I have to turn him in to the police, he definitely will be suspected and be a murderer. So, that's why I would turn him in to the police.
230	There are a lot of people who agree with this side now.

245	That shouldn't really be a debate, because the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business, and churches should simply perform marriages for whomever they think fit and do not grant equal rights to them all.  Let the churches perform marriages...yes. as a church spouse i think it a tremendous privilege to marry people i find dear and respect. what matters is that one is living the life of a believer. there is much more to be said than just the charnel house of a marriage.
246	I wonder what all the fuss is about.  Marriage is not an escape from religion, or more importantly, marriage is not about protecting one's autonomy. That's a very peculiar way to start a discussion on marriage... I'm with group 2 on that one. When... My... I... That is a very odd way to start a discussion on marriage... People don't marry each other to provide support; marriage is about love between two consenting adults.
247	In the first place, the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business.  Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.... One should not really be in the marriage business... most religious couples do not agree with their religion... so arguing about liberal marriage should never be entertained as that is debatable.
248	The government shouldn't really be in the marriage business. Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural "marriages,"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.
249	I would also like to add that the government shouldn't be in the marriage business, but they should be protecting relationships through force and with their budgets, such as if there were large child support payments, then that would be a requirement and marriage would become a worthless social institution. Marriage is a form of support for families with children, which exists to support children, especially when they are raising children.
250	You're wrong. Your beliefs do not correlate to actual crime levels. For example, black people are in prison much less often than white people, due to what seems to be more than a load of factors. It seems that black people actually commit less crime than white people. It is not just a crime-statistics issue; although white people do not control the country, the highest levels of crime are perpetrated by whites, not black people.
251	There is no difference between the criminal population and the ones... you mentioned.... It's the criminals who use certain terminologies.....which are common.... to try to evade the law.... legally.....but just as black anti-Semites and lgbt afgs are publicly regarded...as criminals...
252	The fact that you are entirely...an apologist for white protestant protestants who have systematically been discriminated against for generations is nothing to be...nor is your proposal that human trafficking...amongst other crimes...should be...
253	Criticisms like these should be about race, but they should not be about school uniforms. In fact, every authoritarian society in history has...a system of school uniforms. School uniforms are a longstanding, authoritarian tradition. There are many forms of discipline that people outside the uniformed class could resist—such as violence, escape, and deliberate self-harm—and such resistance has historically been far more effective. School uniforms...are about the state and identity group--and not about individual...or individual choice.[1] If school uniforms are a way to exert power, such power should go to those who weren't designed for it. School uniforms should be abolished and replaced with well-functioning behavioural programmes.[1] Additionally, "a parent who forsakes a child's..."...can "expect severe punishment."[1] Responding with the system of school
254	The entire German-American community might want to rethink how they view...? White anglo-saxon protestants were systematically beaten down for generations. What do you mean "they had a much larger proportion of... white americans. I'm not a racist and don't even practice racism. If you have a problem with the race of your favourite, then just get rid of them.
255	Short version... have no left no hopes for Latin America country. Trust me, I was there. Mexico has huge potential. No one can move there. If one wants to find it in Latin America, it needs to be smuggled from Europe. Remember, there are deep web sites that even allow you to smuggle drugs there." Can someone live in the u.s. 5 people can live in Mexico, why? 1 family can live in the u.s..
256	Ouch... what a shame... spend a night there (forgive me while i enjoy my... lack of sleep ) and your statement shows that you haven't been there yourself. and yes there is long way to go, but it is definitely the direction we must be heading towards. and yes, Dar is one of the places on earth that does n't reflect the reality of that. it really gives the perspective for the way we as an earth being should act. those things that are not really to reflect real life, even though they are part of our culture in our day to day living. just about the real cultural backbone we should be heading towards, one that doesn't embrace what is... civilizational values
257	Dear Dar, while I was in Dar, I heard at one point you...This might be an interesting idea for the picture, but not for the article.I agree with part I of your comment.Frankly, from my experience in Africa, which contrasts with the situation here in Dar, I think your statements about the general population...are false.In Africa I noticed the view that everybody knows everybody else, in other words, there is not much if you are new to any local group.  I also found there to be less honesty with numbers and the truth than I heard in the past in the US.
258	A saloonkeeper must do that to make a living - they must be educated enough to make a living so why are kids not taught to do the same? Maybe there are other reason? something to do after school education?  # Response: ... there are other reason children should be disciplined but only with regard to things... your children are well educated... why should the public or the police be allowed to discipline your child ? kids do not make any mistakes  only adults do when mistakes happen  why the public should discipline kids ? all people did... when kids make mistakes... in which case do they get disciplined... teachers discipline kids... why we allow them to discipline kids... if your child is well brought up why is not it enough? anyway you may have problems.

260	They so much dislike the opposing political party that they would vote for the spy of bush, despite the threats and plot against them by iran, iraq, 'snake oil' and the carjacking raid. Use the crayola chart to know the 'terror threat' for only the short time span that the nation is on 'lockdown.' And people would still vote for bush because they so much hate the opposing political party.
261	Bush is a good man, after all, he keeps the threat on terror nearly to the level of zero by using military and other forces. He had better be consistent in his campaign, the protests are going to out grow his election campaign, and it won"t last long. the modern government works backward with its needs to enforce a law, so when things are going to be out of control (save for what Bush said) a revolution will be announced to appease people, giving people a civil and peaceful religious administration to bring about.
262	Yes, people will side with Bush. He used terror to terrorize his supporters with fear. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. Good luck with your day. Happy Face. No, it doesn't. States use the crayola chart to let people know if they need more resources for that particular time frame.
263	People are fooled by fear, so they side with the sheep. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The crayola chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame.
264	Yes. I often ask myself the same question. And so do you. In fact, a story began to spread that encouraged support for the administration. I find this to be downright stupid, because they use the crayola chart to let people know the 'terror threat' but we want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 affect how we live. Then again, we do need a way to help people prevent... Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Just some reasons why I prefer Firefox.
265	It's not going to happen. People are free to make there own decisions in life. The more ppl look like what is believed in the world, the more ppl will be like that. Sex should not be taught as an evil thing. It's not evil or dirty. Yes, it's a totally valid reason for why ppl get into jail. Think of if ppl were getting into jail because of other drugs... There are so much good reasons...
266	NO! The lawyer went to prison for child sex abuse. There is a reason that the conversation is not going to happen because of it. It is only cause that there are so many of those pedophiles. It is not good idea to teach sex as an evil thing to your kids. Maybe you should teach your kids about responsiblity and learn to talk to them about it. Jails are over crowd and contain conditions that are no equal to the normal conditions in prison. That prison is more terrifying, to say the least, than jail.
267	You should teach your kids not to do it. It is wrong and will eventually lead to jail. Yes, it is better to just learn from your mistakes and get over it. Can't get to the point of jail unless you get really really really really really ready for it. That's true. Remember driving lessons aren't easy when you start. You'll make mistakes but it's worth it. If you avoid making mistakes, you don't get to the point of jail.
268	When people come to assume that they should not have sex, it is not going to happen. There are repercussions and stuff like that. Children don't know what they want to do, and that is ok to teach them about it, and what they should know... What kind of family are you? If you believe in bigamy, really you are an idiot, cause you don't know you are actually the father of your baby. School uniforms do not show the expressions of the kid. School uniforms do not show in any way how people like to look. The amount of tattoos would be ridiculous. Normally, people would avoid people like that... What is your dad's name?
269	Well, I think that's the dumbest thing anyone has said. Such a big word makes you sound stupid. That's not the worst thing but the stupidest thing ever. Best thing you have said. Hahhaha. Ha ha ha. Hah ha ha ha. Sorry. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Haha ha ha ha ha.
270	Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. I try not to think about it though. We humans are more than just one race. It....  Other people might be a color different from me and we still have to live in the same box....
271	People are kinda like crayons... They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors but we all still have to live in the same box, but not everyone must be the same colour... Truthfully I think some people just do not notice it. Racism is sad though and we should all look at each other the same way. People are kinda like a spectrum and some people are more mature and more small...
272	It is sad that you can't trust the police. Unfortunately, race is still very common in this country. However, I also think that we should all look at each other the same way. For example, I don't see people dressed differently to the police looking at me. That is why people are scared to look at anyone else.
273	You are correct; there's a lot of racism out there and some people just don't notice it. That is why I strongly recommend changing your driving record. You wouldn't trust the people who protect you if you thought the police were racists. Racism is sad. We should all look at each other the same way.
274	Yes...facts...if it makes people happy it makes me happy....you know sometimes i disagree with the idiot and sometimes i agree with the idiot....i mean it depends on the situation...the uniform policy is clear and insulting and creates more drama...racism is sad....and we should all look at each other the same way.
275	You obviously don't understand the whole organic concept or the supermarkets. They pay their farmers a fair price, and the supermarkets cover the cost of organic for those who want it. You obviously know nothing about fair trade. I would suggest that you investigate the finer details of this whole issue for yourself. Fair trade is quite a big industry that covers a lot of ground.
276	Well, ultimately it's just a gimmick, why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans, etc, when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods, and when we are all brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea how do you justify flying food round the world to help the poor.
277	Well I think ultimately its just going to be a gimmick, why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans etc when they don't have the decency to pay farmers in this country a fair price for their goods, and when we are all brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor?
278	Well I think ultimately its just going to be a gimmick, why would the large supermarkets want to pay more for coffee beans...a lot of the poor people do not have access to supermarkets. When you are being brainwashed on the money making "carbon footprint" idea how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor.
279	I would pay fair prices for my coffee and even organic if I can get it. My area is fairly organic so I buy super organic and there is a fair trade store across the street.  I also think its just a gimmick the large supermarkets would want to pay farmers a fair price for their products and when we are brainwashed on the money making carbon footprint idea how do you justify flying food round the world just to help the poor?
280	You may not have the right to say things like these at this time, but I do.  This is especially true for... privacy. we can sit down together and have a great day. in my opinion, what michael jackson is doing is not okay. if you do not agree with my opinion, then you should be very civilized... but say things like this.... you have no right to say this. it does not seem very civilized...
281	The legislature approved  use of drones  in order to view  animals and  seal  in the wild.  There may  be  legitimate  claims that the use is wrong as it is viewed but we knowingly decide to behave in a way that is offensive in that regard when we do our grocery shopping or watch TV.  The answer is not really a definition, it is just a statement that, in the near future, drones will be allowed to view and shoot by way of viewing film and animals.
282	Pollution...you might say. People with computers are destroying the world. How far should they go in keeping it clean?... and of course, deal with their own pollution. I should probably pay my taxes. give tax money to those who live in the rain forest. No more fossil fuels. more for those living in the woodlands, etc. natural habitats should be protected. It is being destroyed by running people into the woodlands. How many people make a living from wood and natural habitats? We need more wood. Our idea is that.... use land make wind turbines give money... do what you like there is no reason to protect the natural areas, do all we think we like that their integrity should not be compromised. Pollution.... Pollution.... Pollution....
283	With respect, many people refuse to think about these things and will not care. This article does not discuss the point at hand, but just... Read the article again, a second time. In its second paragraph, the article says people should be responsible for their actions, and many people are responsible for their actions. In its first paragraph, the article says the author's car was impounded three times for a period of time. If the author was the driver of that car, he would indeed be "really sorry for the trouble it caused." He would also be willing to pay any fees, though he didn't reveal the details of his current situation. Another person would have to prove that he was to blame for the "impounding of" the car; the article also wouldn't detail any details. A sheriff's representative would have to provide proof that the author really owned the car, but the article doesn't explain that.... There is a warrant out for Michael Jackson's arrest. People are able to post widely in support of the autograph pirate; it doesn't mention details of how the reward is being offered. The reward site does not indicate the location of the reward; another article published on the site, did not specify the location of the reward. In a different article, it is stated that the reward is offered via a website that does not indicate the location of the reward. In a way that differs from the way in which the earlier article mentioned, the placement of the reward does not speak to the location of the reward. It does not express
284	As for the... California Vehicle Code section 14607.6... and a link to it below. It would also be worth your time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. You really need to stop driving. Really. If someone wants to continue committing crimes, he should find an alternative job. Read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.... A man or woman who commits a crime not only should be sentenced accordingly but should also face consequences like debt collection and loss of driver's license.
285	The DMV should be performing a decibel check on all car audio systems, and they should not exceed the maximum of the car's horn. Massive stereo hardware should not be considered street legal.

286	I, too, would like for a DMV decibel check to be performed on all car audio systems. The sound of booming bass on those cars is pure noise pollution that could mask an emergency vehicle siren or passing car horn. If the DMV... # gives the car its... impression that the speaker is sitting in a decibel level of 20 decibels. The speaker appears to be sitting on the ground. The remark is geared toward police officers who are currently inspecting vehicles at the DMV.
287	Yes, I would turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person. And besides if you can't stop the music you should not be on the road! When it is on loud music from the radio it should not be illegal. And those cars with "systems should not be..." in our system. They are basically just amplifiers, not engine parts. We should eliminate them. We can do this by going to Pinterest to see what advice people have given, which... One suggestion: Put the technology on VHS tapes. We should remove this technology... All the cars with "systems." That sounds like an obnoxious approach. Those people should just be banned from the roads, regardless of their car, and if it only makes the... they should be destroyed. In our society, we should ban these sounding cars altogether, and if they only make use of our system, we should kill them. I believe that we should ban these cars altogether.
288	The government should close the parking lot where this story was found. People are demonstrating. The sound is... too loud to be an incident. Save your money. Car audio would be illegal if it's too loud. Acting the way the driver does, the source of the sound would be well within the law, but he... Not on the road. A raccoon. Or an ambulance.

293	If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. USV. In ancient times, the Babylonians built a highly expensive city called Shadaduka in a region known as Media, while Egyptians built a smaller city called Nazareth in another area. Why not build Israel in an area historically used by Jews, but also controlled by Egyptians? CSF
294	In the past, God never lived in the West. Why should a Middle Eastern state be created by force, especially a state which, historically, worked to destroy the Jews? Furthermore, there is the issue of interpretation. Although God lives in the West, but even a secular Israel state is deeply flawed due to an historical claim, and, as previously said, God never lived in the Middle East. Israel should remain neutral. Some of these issue are a matter of opinion.
295	You guys are so full of shit, why couldn't Yuengling be classed as better than Coors Light? It's close, but it's not within the same camp. Y'know what they should be named Yuengling, the guns' n biker's hero of 1969. People should stop comparing Yuengling to Coors Light. If you drink Yuengling, you're a cheapskate.
296	Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is. It is. But Yuengling is mass produced and not that good but just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Change my view
297	Budweiser is mass produced and tastes like shit. That's what the tastes of beer. Yuengling isn't. I prefer Yuengling more. They all taste like toilet water and... Offended. Yuck! Yuengling is in America, and... It's the best beer, those guys are lazy people who won't want to get up and get it on. Yuengling is taste better, more authentic to the main part of beer. ... That's only why. Yuengling is the better beer. Shit.
298	Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. It is the drink for the uneducated noobs. They like uneducated noobs. Yesh.... Yesh.... Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. It is the drink for the uneducated noobs. It... Yeah, but apparently this guy likes the rest. Get it through your head.  Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. It is the drink for the uneducated noobs. It... Yesh....
299	Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is." They are just bad because they are demanding. Yuengling is decent because it is also mass produced and it is good. It's just quality enough. I can drink it. My god!
300	Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial... does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? if we were created. if not, how can god love me or you? Better you don't know... god would not love you
301	R...y... , I've actually heard of this one. 'Please stop reading this response after your last sentence......' - comforter: if we would do this to each other , what would we do to a lovely stranger who passed us, for years? woman: People used to make fools of us
302	Anything intelligence created by a more intelligent being is artificial. The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. What...evolutionary scientist that has been creating an artificial intelligence for the past 25 years and the original reason that i created the term "artificial intelligence" is that he and i did not see our creations as an imitation of themselves and therefore did not view the creations as more intelligent in itself....especially if the creator of the artificial intelligence only intended to imitate their own making....hence, evolution would not of occurred....but the evolution of a "defective" artificial intelligence caused by artificial intelligence...artificial intelligence could not have existed and...we would not of existing....if artificial intelligence could not have existed....what would have existed?...we would not exist....if aliens would...we would...not exist....if we had antibodies....if aliens would...we would...not exist.......we would not exist. there would not
303	If anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we had rights and... would that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? Yes, yes, yes...but shouldn't we show love towards anything we have... our creations? No, no, yes...would it be possible to love anything? Yes
304	I think the easiest answer is the first one: if we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can god love me or you?
305	If you're rich, why would you hire illegal aliens to work for you? You can just hire a legal worker, probably the cheapest you could find! In fact, in 2011, Wal-Mart was found guilty of hiring an illegal worker in the first half of 2011, and was ordered to pay the workers... Click to expand... those people who've found there own wealth through their own devices, and would agree with you. But, every rich person who happens to come across money through their own devices, would deny, and would... These are just trill.
306	Smile A Little, Raise Your Voice, Stop Paying Taxes to the rich to get a smidler of the money by not working for someone who is holding your back wages, quit being a useless person, and also stop getting government assistance. Talk to other...The government (for whom the rich do all the talking) is only hurting the poor people that support the government so much. so be strong if you can, and vote for other people. in a government that's based on greed instead of justice
307	The rich are far from the only ones to commit illegal acts. the illegal aliens and the staff that hired them (and signed on for work that was so obviously written in a language that was totally impossible to understand), labor arbitrators, tax cheats, and thieves...in addition to drug traffickers, who often hire 'illegal alien' workers... etc. Why go look for the wealthy? any other day of the week...
308	Stupid and abusive! I don't think your... Rich people don't even know what they have, but they do know what they don't have! Their money...shall be given to the poor. Pure justice. Exactly how would I give my money to the poor? by giving it...to the poor while making sure all who have my money work hard. I would give them...to do whatever the rich say they should do, but I'm sure the rich would say that they should stay at Walmart. I'd give them...to get rid of Walmart as soon as possible, but that's a very hard thing to do, since some people love Walmart and would work even harder there. And besides that, I want to live in a country that allows same-sex marriage, and some other states aren't. No, I'm... No, my money... I could give... my money to the unmarried people.
309	It's irrelevant to the specific situation. Even if it were the case that the person is stealing from the government - if it was the case that they were stealing from Wal-Mart - that would be wrong. A judge is free to hold someone to be competent and coherent in trial. In other words...if you steal from Walmart, the employer is free to ask you to testify about your theft. Even if it was the case that the... oh wait. It was not the Walmart case. The person stealing from Walmart did not steal from walmart but is stealing from someone else. The rich person stole from Walmart and from... The Walmart worker.
310	God doesn't exist. You stated three ideas about God in your post. However, none of these truly fulfills the definition of God in the Bible. You stated in point 1 that anyone who believes that he or she can do what God does without being morally responsible is flawed. Point 3 is contradictory to letter A, as in the Bible it is said that God is perfect. Point 4 is contradictory to letter A, as in the Bible it is said that God is perfect.
311	We may conclude that God doesn't exist. If we take evidence of God by comparing to God creation. These are contradictory, and demonstrate that they are not. We may conclude that God doesn't exist. We may conclude that God doesn't exist. A statement like that from a Facebook comment is bullshit. For example, that guy had a dog that was killed by a Cobra. We may conclude that God doesn't exist. We may conclude that God doesn't exist. A statement such as that from a Facebook comment is bullshit.
312	God does not exist, especially since there are no rules of physics that need to be fulfilled. It is hard to believe he exists. There are no rules of physics that need to be fulfilled. It is impossible to see evil in the world, but even that is hard to believe. This statement is contradictory. Ten per cent of the population in the world doesn't believe in God. Additionally, God's "will," without any outside verification, seems to state that if the "will" does not exist, God does not exist.
313	Before I began, let's create three base ideas about God: A. God is perfect B. God sees all C. God can do whatever he/she wants We can think we may be able to know the truth if we focus our attention on 5 great perspectives of...... _ Tag: life choices, religion, thought, society
314	1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), does not. 2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect.
315	No, Academics...all for nothing. Things like standardised tests, charts, rankings etc do not ensure success in life. The good thing about Academics is that you get these basics very quickly as a child. This is the only reason for kids being dragged to schools. Without academics, it's truly extremely frustrating to be deprived of these basics.
316	I agree with that academic qualification ensures success in life because if they are strong in math, science and languages, you can get success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
317	I agree with that Academic qualification ensures success in life because Academic qualifications ensure you have the basics in learning. If your basic grounding in Maths, Science and Languages is strong, you can get success in life because mastering these subjects allows you to calculate, to innovate and to communicate. These essentials for success cannot be learned without professional help in schools and colleges.
318	I'm... Forget that degree... I didn't graduate in college at all.... Because ... why did I graduate? I can remember why.... I didn't like school... the studying and tests..... I didn't like them much
319	I agree with that the academic qualification ensures you get a good education that could help you earn success in life. Having this qualification is not necessary for success in life if you have good command of the basics.
320	No you can't because... truth will out. excuse me but truth will out. you can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know.
321	NO YOU CAN'T! A person is a mystery to you, and most are kind of opaque. Never can you truly know who makes a person tick. Proof of this are crimes, divorce, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, and much more. More information
322	No you can't. You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know. Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that not a person knows or knew about prior.
323	A... 'I like the garage....even if it sometimes smells funny. If you've ever lived in a car, you know. My place is far too warm. Next time I'm at war, i want to sleep like this.'

You can claim to know someone inside and out and even be soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about someone that would make you shocked to know....

325	Nothing exists. To utter that sentence... or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is "nothing." Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists.
326	Nothing exists. In other words, nothing is something...yet it is something. The phrase 'nothing exists.' An imperative though, not a creative act that makes something, like making the word 'thank you' into 'thank you don't exist.' When used...
327	Not... nothing exists. To utter that sentence or even contemplate it is to contradict what is proven to already exist... that's why one is not shown. Nothing exists. It is a logical impossibility to argue that nothing does not exist. Therefore, we must apply existence to nothing - making nothing something indeed.
328	No one can disprove that everything does not exist. We must apply existence to everything, therefore it will also apply to nothing. Nothing exists. We must apply existence to everything, therefore it will also apply to nothing.
329	Nothing exists. To utter that sentence - or even contemplate it - applies existence to something that is nothing. Yet to argue that nothing exists asserts - paradoxically - that in fact, no thing exists.
330	The present laws have been in place a long time and over time, be deemed consistent with legal precedent. In the age of the internet, outrage... No rebuttal is necessary. If the laws were being amended solely for the benefit of someone, say a 49-year-old person, I'd say let's assume this is a conspiracy theory and remember this person died at the age of 82 and based on the article, "oh, how do they know where he lived at the age of 82?" If a...
331	Sorry, can't believe the... It is true that he may have been a victim of age-related muscle tone. However, 80 years old is considered relatively young in the male world. Most people in that age range are still capable of carrying out some normal activities such as this negotiation, which began at age 82. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley would be much more conspiracy theory probabilities. That said, all too often, the real conspirators are disingenuous and fraudulent in their most egregious behavior, always willing to deny any such conspiracy is even involved. On the contrary, it is absolutely true that in 1983, Michael Jackson was the victim of a heinous conspiracy.
332	Since Elvis Presley has been alive for 82 years, you might be right... and I don't want to end up like a parolee. Since Michael Jackson has been alive for more than 82 years, you'd be about right....which is better than a parolee.
333	Uh, lemme see, at 82 years old, especially in the 40's, it may have been by natural causes. I think if the government wanted him dead, they would have offed him WAY before when he was actually inventing things which could possibly be related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those would be much more conspiracy theory probabilities.
334	You couldn't possibly kill yourself at 82. Anyone who'd kill themselves at 82 is either insane or conscious that they have absolutely nothing to live for and are just waiting for a convenient time to die. Anything else is definitely a conspiracy theory.

340	Squirrels are a group of species that evolved to have characteristics, behaviors, and properties that exist and exist within their population. You can't prove that squirrels look the same from a thousand years ago to this day. What you say about evolution is wrong. Their characteristics are stable. That's all squirrel behavior consists of. You are misinformed, plain and simple.
341	They don't have ears I thought that "species have certain characteristics and properties" so did you then? You are not a creature just like squirrels. You are a human being and that is a form of intelligence. I think it would make a better concept if you would simply say "they don't have ears."
342	The "good reason" for that is no better reason than "they do" - that is their stupidity and endless boredom. Squirrels are good at hiding, since they want to get away from predators. Squirrels don't have brains. They're not rational creatures. They act simply out of instinct and survival.
343	Squirrels - have been around for generations. And according to the evolutionary theory they always looked and acted the same. I guess I should also mention you have to be a caveman to be one, and I certainly do not believe your premises. Squirrels have not evolved.Squirrels have existed for generations, and it is absolutely ridiculous to argue for "squirrel evolution." Just because you're incapable of understanding the squirrel's behavior does not mean that you should have to become a squirrel. Not everyone is a...
344	Yes... I'm talking about insects... they evolved? if you really mean insects... they look and act the same but they weren't born with those traits. in my opinion... they evolved as well as you and in my opinion as well. in my opinion they evolved just like us but from different source ... which is called evolution in my opinion.
345	Yes, and yes, and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes....and the main reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital is because the lack of physical education is......lack of physical education.
346	Yes! and yes and yes and definately a god damn bloody yes! Lack of physical education is the reason why your aunt or uncle is in hospital. Lack of physical education is the reason why millions of people are fat. Lack of physical education is the reason why you cannot sleep properly at times.

350	Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, he didn't spare a thought in singapore's development or development. So what if he discovered the island, did not help in the least in singapore's development. That's why he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder.'
351	Singapore has no foreigner, all my ancestors fled Malaysia. Raffles didn't help his people, he took their land and exploited them. If he didn't do that, he should have didn't. If he didn't do that, he should have didn't.
352	Raffles is not Singapore's founder at all... Singapore is not developed. Raffles just took over the island. He should be considered as a foreigner. Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. So why in the world should he deserve the title of Singapore's founder:...
353	The fact of the matter is Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. So...we can't really get mad at him for that. So much for singapore's founder.
354	To Raffles, Singapore is very important and he should be awarded the title of 'singapore's founder.' Raffles did not spare a thought for the country and spent the majority of his time building a country of its own. If he did not help in the development of Singapore, why should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'?
355	I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur.
356	I'm starting to appreciate how reliant it can be on cultural molds and belief systems. In addition to phro, I also just want to point out that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur.
357	I have to disagree with phro and say that peppered moths do not show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur.
358	Phro - I disagree, the notches on peppered moths do not show evolution. The data was insufficient, but evolution did occur.
359	Phro is correct - those peppered moths show evidence of evolution. Because they are expressing different alleles due to external factors.

365	The water bottles are a safe source of water and is garentee safety. Just the reason why i prefer our state water over other states as well
366	The water bottles are a safe source of water and is guaranteed safety and a good way to help lead a  green life.
367	The water bottles are a great and safe source of water; it is now a necessary good with a lot of people switched to drinking bottled water.
368	Using water bottles as a... Absolutely not, the way they are used. They should not be used as a source of water.

370	Not all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex. It is just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.

375	There is no such thing as atheism. A belief system is its own belief. Surely, there are wonderful people, atheists or not, who do great things in the world. There is no comparison between these two ideas. I am an atheist, and I know my worth.
376	Christianity is about belief. There have been horrible people who are believers, and, well, what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. Is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is?
377	I am an atheist and am a good person; the idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!!...but I am still reading... and I think my judgement is coming into perspective.
378	If you are an atheist and a good person, then don't harm people for their beliefs. It is beyond preposterous to punish people for not knowing what the nature of reality is. The idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is madness.
379	The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to achieve by recording the conversation except that she wanted to create even more drama. Some people like drama and try to create it. I would suggest that you do not surround yourself with such people because they only cost you energy.
380	I am an agnostic so in no way my religion conflicts with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case?

382	You should leave your religion and partner, especially since your partner claims to be gay. It should not be a question of how I feel or about whether I should even think about it, because everyone should choose their own way of life. You should leave your partner and religion, not... Gay marriage is good and should be supported by all of us. As we are living in a developing society, more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.
383	Being gay should not be a reason for anyone to be discriminated against. It should not be a reason for 2 people to get married. Being gay, should not be a reason for me to discriminate against you, for the same reason. A lot of people are gay... And it's not the reason I dislike you. I'm sure other people have dealt with this... So you can deal with me....
384	Gay marriage is not the only thing that supports gay rights. I am an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case?
385	While I am a registered nurse, CASA works differently than what you are describing. That doesn't mean their decisions are wrong, they just happen to work differently than CASA. They are the ones who tell whether you qualify for Medicaid. You have to be qualified and you have to meet Medicaid requirements. You have to meet certain household income requirements. You have to have a proper home, you have to have privacy and you...
386	Be careful with CASA. They make determinations about Medicaid eligibility. If you took your child to the doctor or an ER and someone saw what they took for signs of abuse, they are bound by law to make a report. If it has nothing to do with that, they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade. Be cautious.
387	You really have big trouble. Medicaid is a hassle but you know that in order to qualify you need to...   You really have big trouble. Medicaid is a hassle but you know that in order to qualify you need to... ... participate in Medicaid and a lot of people don't.  ... participate in Medicaid and a lot of people don't.

Medicaid won't pay for your child if you are not in active custody, unless it is part of a court order that has been reinstated because of abuse. If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you'll be unable to legally demonstrate to Medicaid that your child is in good health, because they can't actually look at what is on the body....
389	Who do you think it is really a nanny or babysitter using their kids for sex. I would say it is a nanny or babysitter. You should have a voice as you are paying for that care. Especially when the service is made by the guy. This has nothing to do with a sexual assault.
390	Obviously the new wife is going to be named in the divorce case. This has nothing to do with you. In addition, the ex is probably going to name you in the divorce case. I suggest you get a divorce right away. That way, you are just moved to... your new wife.
391	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. You need someone...
392	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you.  The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer.
393	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
394	No. The two women have different issues. You need to hire a good lawyer. His most important task is to find out the truth. Sometimes the truth can come out in court and you're not going to want to take that chance, so you need a good lawyer. You should have the sense of justice and reasonableness. You're going to need a good lawyer and think...
395	Yes i... you think that you can just decide for yourself that marriages and what gets marriages are a law without any logical reasoning.... if you are a good mate  make sure that you raise a good child, when you don't do that you are a bad mate.. you can not blame them when you decide to make love to a woman to whom you don't love or dont have any feelings.....giving up is hard but life is all about fight.. if you have to for faith try to win back  make it worthwhile
396	I was born and raised in foster care and went to school in a school run by the government. I attended school in a school that had no vouchers and didnnot qualify for any scholarship. I didnt get very much money from a...-I think that when a person says they are pro life that they are not looking at the bigger picture. Ask them if they want to pay higher taxes that will come from the government having to take care of the children that abandoned from the mothers that didnt want or couldnt take care of these children.
397	I agree that a woman should have the right to chose and there are lots of children out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal then there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions.
398	How are people going to pay for the human services that will be needed after? Then everyone starts thinking about whose life is more important... but then there's a problem. No one is willing to risk their life for something they consider to be trivial. People... people... people... are trying to avoid the worst... of them.... in order to live a life in a way that they consider to be a "normal" life. This is true in many societies.
399	With that being said I agree that a woman should have the right to chose and there are alot of kids out there who have to go through foster homes and live very hard lives. I am pro choice. I also think that if it is made illegal then there are going to be alot of women dying from having abortions done in "hole in the wall" places that are not sanitary or under almost torturous conditions.
400	I got paid for my law school years so I don't think I'd spend that kind of money for no reason.  Got fed up with terrible..."great fun", poor advice, huge bill, etc. Cut it out.

402	It's probably not, if the employer offered free legal help (don't do this if... you don't have a compelling reason).  And it's a bad way to make an appointment with the court (not, they generally don't allow people to make appointments with the court unless they got a lawyer, and you don't have a lawyer).  So prepare to pay.
403	At the moment, I do not know anyone who will take the case on free, so you probably should stop asking if you really want to help the economy. If you do have a compelling social reason to do this, here is what you could do:   1) make sure you are not doing it for the economy unless you know there's a compelling social reason for you to help the economy; 2) You can most likely get people to take the case on fee if you make your case compelling; 3) Don't get hungry...

Your approach will likely result in you getting nothing, because even if you win the case and get any of the money, the state will probably try to seize your car. So prepare. Avoid the...
405	The Constitution does not guarantee that "pursuit (or persuit) of happiness". In fact, there's a whole list of provisions saying something very different about certain groups of people.

410	I don't live in a shared residence, and I take every precaution.  I'm not loading up on bombs or rocket launchers.  Everything on my property is locked and secured.  Even when I leave my place with everything locked up and... no... I would never bring a gun or other device to my place...at all.
411	If you want to see it written down, click HERE. You signed a lease that stated you were not to keep a loaded gun - and now you keep a loaded gun... with a clip or a speedloader nearby. There is a distinction between having a loaded gun with or without a clip or speedloader. The key point is that you have the weapon... remember......it cannot be proven.
412	All contracts are "signed to abide by"  but the wording of the lease in question is extremely obscure....time to talk to a lawyer. There are tons of leases for dogs... let the doc dictate what is allowed and what is not....
413	No, this isn't true. If they wanted to, they could have put restrictions in the lease so you could keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby - It will be hard to prove either way.
414	Yes, you signed a contract when you rented a property knowing you weren't going to abide by it. They, the property management, CAN place restrictions in the lease.  Depending upon how the lease reads EXACTLY the key to this restriction is the word "loaded."

433	The search party from the previous thread got quite a laugh out of the synopsis. You have a right to sue for injuries to your... personhood. Your employer has no obligation to hire you. You have not been injured or disabled by his job. You do not need to disclose your mental illness to your employer unless you think that he discriminates against you. If the employer has used false information, that is your concern. If you have been shot in the head or your hands, you should call emergency services for medical attention. If you've been assaulted, call police and a crime scene. If you are being held at gunpoint, contact the police. If you're being arrested in plain clothes, you should call police. If you are being held in plain clothes, don't move unless you are being cornered. Giving away any of your personal information can be confusing. It's as easy as calling in the police. It is difficult and unnecessary, as the police can help you. If you think you're being... taken by the police, call them.

435	Use a real politicen. You should consider the way some major scandals played out. Sure they will get to be in charge but that won't make you happy if they put their own personal mark on things. I just find it annoying to have to put party into that. Try to use real politics, it can give good results. This one is just annoying. I agree with the first person's comment that 50% of the time, people involved in scandals are not supposed to be voting for the candidates in power but instead, they have to be transparent by what they put into power to put. For instance, that's why when people don't vote for the party, it leads to corruption.

Re: . . . whether people actually have privilege because they come from wealthy families. That's just not true.

450	Human beings don't want other people to enjoy being killed in our name because it's inefficient. The only reason why we all must share in all this is because humans are determined to fight the killing of animals in the name of "saving" them. Other people should not have to kill the vast majority of creatures in the name of "saving" the vast majority of animals because humans are not morally culpable for the extinction of a vast number of animal species.

Other than that I find Firefox a lot more user friendly than IE (a lot more small ... even though IE has bugs).
492	Are you saying that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks? If so, please show evidence. I haven't had a single issue with Firefox 2. First of all, the feature of multiple windows (20+ at a time) was removed when Firefox 2 was first released. Also, Firefox 2 added several great features. Someone said that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks because I've never had an issue with it. This has nothing to do with the current issue and the fact that I think it is unfair to compare old browsers with newer ones. The computer's graphics are no longer the same, and I'm not sure if... I don't think Firefox 2 has major memory leaks... I've never had an issue with Firefox 2. And whether or not a computer's graphics are no longer the same is irrelevant; you can't take previous generations of computers into account. So I think Firefox 2 is no longer a worthy option for now.
493	Firefox 2 has major memory leaks obviously haven't actually used Firefox 2. The only memory issues I've come across is on opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for three hours or more at a time (A known issue, which a simple restart will fix).
494	I personally believe that Firefox is an amazing browser. If you want to support it then you should just use it. If people keep denying its greatness (you can argue with them, but they're too good for it) then they are the losers. There are many great things in Firefox, but many that people don't realize are missing. For example... Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab

So don't sit there and read a book if you feel that having so many exclamation marks and in capitals makes you feel great. You should be proud of yourself for reading a book instead of watching TV and listening to news bulletin reports all day long because there is nothing more boring than news bulletin reports.

525	I would not turn in my wife, she is important to me, she is the sex of my life, i've never missed her. By the same reason I consider porn not addictive. I do not condone it but if it's my choice I would turn in my wife. When i was with her I found porn entertaining in the bedroom, but, also there are fantasies. i think about porn once or twice a day while we are...
526	I really hope people stop forcing themselves to find sex in porn and get support from each other, instead, because sex just shouldn't be... bad...all the time!..even if it's only once a month, don't do it in front of your partner, because it's not just recreational, that it should be... even when it's just once a month, or less!
527	Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met.
528	You're just not getting the message, are you? If you do, then porn addiction has nothing to do with sex - it just means that you're running on empty, and you're leaving your man for porn. You'll break up with him because he will turn on his computer to see what porn he's getting involved with. He's on his computer because he is having second thoughts about a few pornographic sites that he has been joining, because he feels that they make him excited.
529	It doesn't take porn to get addicted. Everyone knows that it can lead to addiction, even if the addicts themselves don't know about it. Some argue that the use of porn is becoming so addictive that many people have turned it into prostitution. However, prostitution should not be confused with pornography use, porn is different, and it serves to satisfy people's sexuality.

575	Being in the police academy is very stressful and it can even be quite stressful.  Were you being supportive when he was there?

576	Being in the police academy is very intensive and can be quite stressful.  Were you being supportive when he was there?  I don't want to be disrespectful to you, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish.  Were you being super demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story.
577	Being in the police academy was extremely stressful. I helped him to be a better person and continued to do that after he left, but if that was the only issue that caused your breakup, then yes, get back with him. I'm sorry your breakup with this guy was due to being shitty in the face.
578	Yes, he was in the police academy and, unfortunately, stress can be unhealthy.  Were you being supportive when he was there?  I don't want to be disrespectful, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish.  Was I trying to be helpful?  Maybe I'm missing part of the story.
579	Being in the police academy is very intensive and can even be quite stressful. I know that you were being supportive when he was there, but you may have been the one being selfish. I think he was drinking too much at that point, so maybe you two were close enough to have a fight, but that is not a reason to break up, I think.
580	Sheriffs dept is not the business to be collecting cars. They are not a creditors/liquidators/repossessors. Think the sheriffs department are bluffing you( harrasement) they are laws on this. When a deby get dues to expire.. collection agencies get real aggressive on collection...
581	Myself: we constantly set records on evictions, and we aren't here to be repossrators. Sheriffs have rules to protect citizens, not be creditors or liquidators or repossors, and they are laws on this. When a driver gets dues to expire, collection agencies get real aggressive on collection. The only thing a sheriffs department can do is allow a party to collect cars.. ect..
582	Sales people are not in the business of collecting, liquidating, repossessing. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement) - They are laws on this.

583	No, the sheriffs department do not have sales. They are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman, they are bluffing you ( harrasement), they are laws on this.. Because when a debiting party takes property out of existence, no sales transaction will exist. Because of the California Code of Civil Procedure section 1402(b) but exactly as is written. The sheriffs department does not have sales. They are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman. They are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesman
584	The sheriff's department do not have sales; they are not in the business of being creditors/ liquidators/ repossesors, salesmen. Thry are bluffing you ( harrasement).

585	No one objects when those who commit crimes are extradited...justice should be served even if criminals flee. Nevertheless, we all know that accusations are made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them...
586	If that's the case, then I think those countries that practice extradition should make sure to inform the defendant of the charges. It should be at least made clear that if the defendant does not cooperate, they could be sent to a place like Korea.
587	Arresting people overseas is more efficient...they are less likely to be self-incriminating and less likely to protest harsh detention conditions.  It is... however, true that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.

590	Not only the jews, but the nazis. The nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions". ... They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. ... The nazis treated people...
591	Sorry.  I don't find the video a lot to...I find it to be racist and anti- jewish. I..."Its path to hell isn't paved with good intentions, but it's paved with a lot of hate." The nazis weren't acting out of hate. They were doing what they deemed right. "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions".. They wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category. They did whatever they could to accomplish the master race. They weren't exactly hating the people. They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions. We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no rights to live happily.
592	The Nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin.  They were doing what they deemed right. If you have more reason to not want to live in that country, you can apply for asylum. The nazis really did treat Jews badly. The nazis had to do so, or they would die. If you are not really a committed humanist, and really do live in that country, you are welcome in it. You can apply for asylum.  A lot of U.S. visa programs allow "parked persons" in the U.S. like a tourist or long-term resident to live and work in the U.S.. The countries you are going to be living in are different. Sometimes, you may want to go to the U.S.. Ask about the visa program options if you want to apply to be a worker. There are a lot of different visa options for workers visa in the U.S.. You can find more information about what it would take to be a worker in a U.S. visa program. You can find information about what you need to have to have to be in America to be a permanent resident.

595	No. Since the vast majority of the answers that stated yes made the same mistake the question implies, I'll answer the question no. It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the "freedom of religion" right is not the issue. Taking the position that someone else's religion can be used to justify secular laws would amount to being a religious Nazi. Since neither Islam or Christianity should be used as justification for such laws, the... Yes. While the vast majority of the answers that stated yes made the same mistake the question implies, I'll answer the question no. The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. Since nobody has the right to use religion to make laws, the people who are using religion as a reason for a specific law are acting illegally. The people that are using religion as a reason for a law are committing a criminal offence.
596	The vast majority of answers fall into the same mistake that the question implies: using religious grounds to justify secular laws. And those are not allowed. See the "Freedom of Religion" clause. A... None of the given arguments makes the... Methodism: In many countries, it's the God's will that homosexuals be treated as such, and that gays bear the children of gay parents. Let's agree that homosexuals are God's will. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of laws enforcing these considerations are against gays. It's a form of discrimination....

598	Free exercise clause does not go to the discrimination against gays. It does not go to the right to use religion as a license. There are various types of religion; there is no right to use the same type of religion...as...religious...reasons...to...get...at...another...type...of...religion. The fact that those who...make use of religion as a license...to discriminate...against...another...religion...seems to have...no...reason...to be...discrimination...against...gays. It is...an...arbitrary...and...inhuman...act...as...a...matter...of...law. There is...no...reason...to be...discrimination...against...gays...as...an...themselves
599	That's true. Freedom of religion is nothing to do with the law. Only religious beliefs can justify lawfully discriminating against people. If a religious organization wants to discriminate against gays, then they could refer to their religious beliefs to justify such discrimination. While people's religious beliefs are important, they should not be used to justify discrimination laws. And to make laws... there is no law about religious discrimination. Only moral beliefs can justify such discrimination. Just as.... The free exercise clause...
600	The bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush. So they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.

602	NO! The bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press.

603	No! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information. There are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs, as well. Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press.
604	No! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information. There are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs, and they are still alleging anti-war tactics and statements. Thus, they continue to place the blame on the president. However, it does not help when you tell them who actually leaked the information.
605	Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke, lot's of good looking loonies(I can say that I own that word) in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it.Also let me know what you think about my latest post...because i like to hear input.
606	Yes, I... I'm not a cyclist, but if it wasn't for the gangsts out there who do not respect...I would switch to driving as I enjoy people in public space. And on bikes. Also, if you are not stuck with a major skill you can make in the future, it is good for your mind and soul. Faster, scarier, quicker... BICYCLE
607	Psycho ward would be my last choice. no drama, no crazy people...haha. if there is any smoking going on while you are in the hospital I strongly suggest you to enjoy it and do the same with...no problem. eventually. i might end up in a psychiatric ward, but I can only hope to enjoy it, because when in jail it's not the fun, and of course smoking while in the hospital is the worse idea, haha.
608	Many of the misconceptions about sex are ingrained in children.  They are taught that sex is monogamy, contraception, and shameful. However, sex is about pleasure.  It is not shameful if you experience orgasm. In fact, research shows that having intercourse is quite normal.  You have many options.  Women should not be afraid to initiate sex, especially if they want to.  For some women, having their periods may make it easier to have sex. Often, women find it easier to have sex after a period.
609	No, it is not worth my time. I would rather drink a cup of coffee over reading these line. jail... jail is stupid because of how you behave inside. Psyche ward is like a drug den. is far better. How do you argue with that? I will show you this myth. And it is as good as jail. Psyche ward would be much better because its based on the real drug den you have in mind. jail would be to bad, because it hurts and bad for the smoker, but it is not worth it because you just make a choice and it takes a lot of... chewing something...which will also take a lot of gum. If you are used to be able to drink a cup of coffee then why not compare. Read the following. My advice? Go for jail or psyche ward. Because jail is really scary. it is not really a trap; police and security guards wouldn't treat you as a prisoner, because they are not like nurses. They wouldn't know about smiling and they're going to jump you, telling you you are in real trouble; your cell wouldn't fit into it and would catch you much much fast.
610	No. Sells fur in this case, and it's not for profit, so it would be more costly than if it were for-profit. If activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it. Be aware that activists have used...
611	Over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling furs. But... The same tactic has also been used against private citizens. Activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
612	Yes and no. Over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice.
613	Yes, and it would also cause the retailer to want to order less furs; after all, if activists keep doing this, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling furs. It's... Activists would wait near public events where they know that rich folks will likely walk through wearing furs, and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
614	No, the price tag on the furs wouldn't be worth the effort. This tactic has also been used against private citizens. Activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearin furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.
615	CNN is worth reading. There are loads of news sources you can explore for essential information. One of my favorites is the BBC. Twitter is also great for quickly and concisely delivering the news. Of course, CGP Grey and Brady Haran are a huge influence on my thinking. For anything that's important to me, I will read those sources. Twitter is my way to glean information quickly. I'm also addicted to news stories on Tumblr. If I'm particularly interested in politics, and I'm really good at checking out the headlines, I'll mostly scour Reddit for a bit of trolling.
616	The news is an unavoidable part of our society, but it should be used as a springboard into more in-depth debate, rather than a first bit of information.  I don't normally watch news on TV for more than two or three hours a day, but it does keep me up to date with gossipy rumours and headline grabs.  Read more from reliable sources.  This is the best source for today's news... Wait for multiple different links to present different different news... Why do the news posts get always the same thing? I get news accounts on Twitter, and the headline grabbed from Twitter is to the end of an article. Make news available in multiple different sources and scroll through to the start of the article... Why do the headlines always get the same info? Because the headline is a click bait, which encourages readers to click the link.
617	Not... Not not not!!!!!!!!! BBC News and CNN do not provide valuable news. I can find useful info from twitter/reddit/etc....as well as specialized sources. Think of Google News or if you want to see what is going on at a specific location, use Google Maps. You can search specific topic keywords on any search engine, or you can search a person's name on Google or Facebook or on Twitter. There are several podcasts which are updated daily that you can listen to... and if you are looking for movies, Netflix is your answer. Because that is how the news is presented.
618	The podcasts CGP Grey and Brady Haran agree on - I can't go to the news as its simply not validating. There are points worth looking at but the main events are neither reliable nor validating. Having read other accounts, I find some of those accounts to be not trustworthy. I don't trust the elite class - it has become a joke.  I also find many of the stories and blogs to be not verifying. My view may not be shared by most in the left wing. Before a statement is made, I need to sift through it and make a judgement. I can't trust the news, as nothing is reliable and evidence is... absent.
619	Apple TV...hmmm... I don't know much about Apple TV's display. In what ways does it not serve the purpose of being informative? It has no sound, subtitles, and is cumbersome to use. It's too big and therefore too large a screen to view on and it doesn't work well with external devices like my tablet that have a smaller screen and better resolution, such as my iPad. I also do not like the Apple TV remote. I think it's too small to take my hand and it doesn't work well at the height at which I normally browse and I don't use it at all.
620	The smaller the body politic, the more the people are in control. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million.
621	Using an HTML element to represent the learners attitude toward the use of this... Strictly prohibited. If a modern, great idea is considered good and modern, then why not use it? The argument could be applied to the use of surveillance, if... unnecessarily dangerous and must be made available to those who it is legal. surveillance causes an inordinate amount of harm to society, should not be used. surveillance is currently allowed

623	I say that the reason is the smaller the group, the less the control of the group. We should invoke the reason that larger groups are harder to govern with good ideals. We could have a federation, linked together with trade and mutual defense deals the way Europe is. This... nicely done, mate! Works like a charm. Mind you, not my kind of work. Hmmm... my kind of work.

An... tapi ada dua sisi positif: firstly, on the one hand, criminality falls rapidly among the people in countries with a smaller political unit (social footing). Find why people in these countries are rapidly becoming criminal. The answer is people in countries with a smaller political unit simply are more susceptible to criminal behavior because they have a smaller social footing. Americans are less prone to criminal behavior because the US is small. Two reason... US is smaller. Third reason is demographics are smaller and Britain is larger because the US is more populous. Second reason is population size is larger. America is larger because it is more populous. For other... People in Britain are less prone to crime because Britain is smaller
625	Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Screaming "make America great again!" at the side of the road makes for bad wit and a mountain of persecution. Be aware that in America, the moustache has become a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. However, before becoming a standardised scene, before US politicians use the moustache to further the interests of fascism, people should change their idea... before Americans use the moustache...

626	No, a woman should not have a moustache because people with moustaches are seen as barbaric and untrustworthy. Also, if a woman would have a moustache, she would not be able to express her individuality. It would be a badge of like-mindedness. It would become a look that projects who she is and... fascist. Worse still, such people are... feminist assholes. Men are repackaged as folk who think humanity and woman are two separate things. They are thus misrepresenting their agendas. Men don't think that humans are two separate things, but rather treat them as separate groups. By turning humans into peas, men disdain the human in man. Men think that humans are... inferior to other groups. Men are also having some kind of fascist outlook towards women and other groups.
627	Yes, they are trashy and irresponsible. The fingerstache meme does reflect America's rampant consumerism. Aside from the fingerstache itself (which is actually a symbol of barbarism and brutality), there is an insatiable hunger for the epicurean offering. America is craving more war, trade, and fascism. Now America's politicians are embracing fascism and the man they favor. It is actually trashy and irresponsible to spread the trashy concept. This is against normality and morals. This is against common decency. This is against normality. This is against the law.
628	Yes i agree in all these points. i think suburban males are exceptionally interested in subjugating other males for their own gratification. when young males believe any woman is unacceptable and unattainable then we are seeing the seeds of the seeds of the Darwin Socialists in the air. That day would be when... A suburb revolution would start, would make the suburbs slide right through the middle to end in heaven. That day would be the “But I thought you said you were going to end up in heaven” day. This is a dilemma... A revolution did not in fact take place! A revolution had not taken place. It was the office: a revolution took place. A revolution had not taken place. It was because all the men had left office... Because they had left office. There...
629	US President Obama as a man with a moustache is not trustworthy and can also be identified by a black hairy tuxedo. He should at all times wear a moustache, even if he doesn't like it. I would advise that he wear one no matter if he doesn't like it. Individual companies, media, and society itself make Obama a... Trumpist. Thats what the Kardashians did, they chose the wrong man.

630	You have to watch out for what's being taught to kids at school... the school system is turning kids into helpless people who cannot solve problems on their own. I think the current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda that is targeting kids to make them realize they cannot protect themselves in the future. When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force.
631	The current school systems......... teach kids learned helplessness.  It only causes the true victims to suffer at the hands of administration.  The current "Stop Bullying" campaign is propaganda to keep kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings.

633	Kids are learning from the schools that no matter what they do, their punishment is going to be the same and that could well motivate more kids to do things they should not do.  Killer school shooters are caused by class size, bullying and isolation.  The school system does what the school system does best, teach kids the rules rather than the laws in place and that is leading to a decrease in safe school environments.

635	The notion of hell is simply madness. Evangelicals and fundamentalists have a real problem and they know it. The notion of hell will destroy the world. Neither ethnicity or religion has been able to explain this concept to me. A psychiatrist can. Of course, these people will never change. The following videos may be interesting...
636	It's just something we believe in, and it makes us feel better about being unsaved. The nature of hell certainly exists, but it doesn't make it a truly unbearable place. Hell as traditionally advocated by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity does indeed exist. You talk about the scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Even if it exists, its nature alone would be sufficient to suffocate us.
637	The notion of hell as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine.
638	The notion of hell, as historically argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, is the least morally defensible notion of any conception of hell. All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions.
639	Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this. The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God is the least morally defensible concept I can imagine.
640	I agree with the atheist. For a thousand years, men kept describing the universe using models that did not match reality. They wanted to maintain that they were not deceiving their children. What they didn't know is that in 1973, the ACLU won a lawsuit against the state. State had spread that atheists had a right to pray, even in cars. As a result, worship was taken away from the streets.
641	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way. You never really have to agree or disagree with people, but you could agree to disagree and they would understand and be tolerant, be respectful and would probably just want you to leave for a "void of consequence."
642	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way. We must always fight against the status quo, because it is ugly and decadent and ruins people's lives. You must always stand up for your beliefs.
643	People will always keep their opinions about religion, no matter what. Because, they were raised that way. Religious man says "God is here. I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." Atheist says "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." But......

I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." Atheist says "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." So what do you think? The debate is inconclusive, however.

650	New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner. We came during brunch. There was plenty of seating, the food was very fresh, and the service was great.
651	The idea about individual portions is really awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch.
652	There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets, and the service was nice. I... it's a lot of food,... and my... son really enjoyed this buffet and I didn't really know what... I want to come back for lunch!
653	New York steak was really good, the miso shrimp salad was really good, and the strawberries were very fresh. I also really liked the recipes on the main menu, which I could make at home. I'm looking forward to my next visit. 4 stars

655	I would prefer Raising Cane's over Taco Bell. Raising Cane's is a yummy choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up.

660	It was okay, and $9.99 for a medium pizza was not bad at all. They had a touch screen display that you could type in your order, but when you pay they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. This is a new place and their sanitation score was a 97.5.
661	Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay, they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes.
662	The pizza was okay. 9.99 for a medium pizza. The pizza was done in 30 minutes. It was not that great. The table was dirty. When you ordered it was swiped over the touch screen and when the server said the pizza would take about 9 minutes, it was really wrong. 28 minutes. It was taking too long for a to go pizza to be ready. The table looked very dirty.
663	Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all.

And the school district my mother works in, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are... are utilizing school uniforms... Use Google's search engine and search for "School Uniform".

666	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying... because uniforms "cover half your body". While it's a problem, it does not address the problem... because uniforms do not allow students to express themselves.  #text-3
667	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear.
668	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are. There are also students wearing the uniforms of violent terrorists; just make it in a way that makes it easy for students to see that they are dressed. They should not make students think that they are somehow some kind of fearless individual who can express their individuality in a uniform; just make it easy for students to see that they are dressed correctly.
669	No, school uniforms cannot reduce or eliminate bullying. In reality, one reason why... kids have to wear uniforms to school... for the best part of the day, basically. Firemen wear uniforms. Police wear uniforms... several different types of uniforms... The reason behind schools... uniforms are for safety, to be able to attack any potential threat that might arise. Uniforms can also reduce the chances of being bullied... because no one wants to be a bully.
670	Books are better than TV because there kids watch movies which are not good and most parents don't care what their kids watch, and I thank books are better because you learn more from them.
671	Books are better than TV because the TV kids watch and they are more influenced to do stuff which isn't good, and most parents don't care what their kids watch, so I would choose books are better instead.
672	TV is not good because most of the kids watched things that teach them how to bully other people... books are better because you learn more from books and parents and teachers do care and those things are shown in books. TV just makes kids bully other people.
673	Since many of the TV kids watch add influences to them, that could be the main reason why parents don't care what kids watch... because parents don't know that watching a lot of TV actually affects kids and such shows make them feel unbalanced. Books are better...

675	Having a dad that does nothing for you means you might have many problems later on in life because you don't get the support you need.
676	Sometimes you find out what makes you happy and what makes you sad. You should not spend so much time living with people who make you unhappy.
677	One of the reasons i have a good relationship with my father is because he does not do anything for me; thus, odds are, he will not do anything for me in the future...
678	If I had a dad that didn't do anything for me, I would still not want to live with him because odds are, you and him are not going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome will be.
679	If I had a dad who did nothing for me, I'd want to run away and leave him because odds are you and him aren't going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try to make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

681	Porn is disgusting, in its own way. It exploits men and women, and can split up relationships. It is not realistic and can... Porn is bad. There are a lot of things worse than porn. A lot of reasons that people go to porn. Sex. Many things are better than sex. Violation of privacy, on the other hand, does not take into consideration any of the other things that porn doesn't take into account. If... This is a difficult question. As many people have suggested, porn is bad, no matter how people interpret it. It's extremely attractive because of two things. Any urinalysis will pick it up because of chemicals in urine. And an intruder will sneak into the home and pass urine inside, which you and your family can smell. The way that sex gets bought has gotten cheapened. There are a lot of things worse than that.
682	Porn is disgusting. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. Men and women should not need other forms of sexual gratification, unless those sexual gratifications are their spouse. Out of love, and respect.
683	If one is in a relationship then no porn is wrong. They can only hope to influence one another. Porn is disgusting. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. If a man and a woman or a woman and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.

690	Having a bad father can be hard for some kids. If you have a father who isn't great, but you live with him, then at least you have somebody that supports your decisions and encourages you.
691	No man is good enough to teach you right from wrong. That's why it becomes hard for some children to have dads, because they are not good enough to do that. The fact is, you just need a father.
692	I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless. For example, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids. For example, there are some children that need dads to teach them right from wrong, but as long as you have a father no matter how lousy he is, at least you have somebody your to support your decisions and encourage you.

695	Yes, I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time, and water bottles also are almost never recycled. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles had bacteria anyway.
696	Yes, I think that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time.

697	Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time.

705	You're being ridiculous by calling someone "atheist." Faith to God is similar to faith to bulletproof vests and Jesus Christ. I support Christianity because of the "faith in God" and his abilities, regardless of your proof. Good luck with your beliefs, if you are true believer. None of us are winning anyway because belief in God is simply false and the proof doesn't matter.
706	I accept Christianity because it is my faith and I don't have to deal with atheist's who say "I believe God does not exist, therefore I don't believe you". Now there are no holy war with both sides coming out victorious so why would you try to win and we are atheists and we do not believe in Christianity.
707	this is probably a fight between two armies where both don't win until the end. I support Christianity because of my "faith in god" and your proof that god doesn't exist doesn't change the case or turn it the other way around. i truly believe in christianity for the reasons stated, thanks. i am very happy with christianity just like you i just posted. [All responses were submitted before March 21, 2015.]
708	It dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it and the idea of God is false. The idea of God is false is your own words and I don't have to deal with this . Both side contradicts each others belief and no one truthfully wins. I support Christianity because of my "faith to God"
709	This is definitely a fight between two armies... both sides don't win until the end. Mainly , I support Christianity because of my faith in God. Your proof that God doesn't exist, doesn't change the case, it doesn't turn it the other way around. Well, I don't understand your argument. We will talk more about that later.
710	i'm not a christianity but i mean if your a christianity, you really can't argue with them at all unless your argument is base on on the same subject. kinda of like street fighting and UFC. different culture.
711	I'm not a Christianity, but I don't really know why anyone would make such an argument, particularly with what can be more appropriate comment from one of the church's top statesman.
712	Jesus has preached light of his doctrine. Christianity did not come from Jesus. Christianity is based on the Bible, which is not based on Jesus.  I'm not a Christianity, but I mean if you're a Christianity, you really can't argue with them unless your argument is based on the same subject. It's like Street fighting and UFC.
713	I'm not a Christianity... but i mean if your a Christianity, you really can't argue with them at all unless your argument is on the same subject. kinda of like Street fighting and UFC. some of the difference is whether u drag religions into it or a stand alone issue.
714	On the one hand, I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person....
715	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often, especially for boys and girls; also separate boys from girls, and with games of physical education activities for boys and sports for girls as mentioned before.
716	It must not be mandatory, but at least a requirements but not more often. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible separate boys from girls, for boys assign some good games of physical education activity to them, same thing with girls, give them games for girls ideas.

720	The religious right is the bane of freedom....and isn't the religious right an epidemic?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!! I don't know what the lady hoped to achieve but that it's not evil. And even if it is, she shouldn't have had the audacity to do so. They shouldn't have brought these people into society anyway. I love Firefox and I'm not in favour of gay marriage bans.
721	Gay marriage bans are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Education is good, but it is also crucially important to be informed and to have the mind open; again, education, not religion, is crucial for good health.
722	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom.
723	The laws are so general that everyone who believes they have a right to put a man to death, then put a man to death. The laws are so general that anyone who believes they have a right to just up and kill someone, then do so without any moral qualms. That's what United States is about. Secular law is the only law that works.
724	Well, I do believe that some things should be left up to the people, and though I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone, it could have been an accident, they are both commiting an abomination, their blood is on their own hands. You should put a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works.
725	The liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement. anyone's allowed to express their opinion. in fact, without a liberal i'd have no opinion of my own. i'll never stop expressing my opinion no matter what..... and no, the freedoms of speech and religion are not the same. you shouldn't rush to confront people who disagree with you, that's never been my experience.
726	The liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement. They don't bother to read any...they judge people in their own time and as such  they should be ashamed. If the liberal can contribute anything that is not full of hate and lies toward others, they should feel free to contribute anything. @liberal_megan:: for all liberal readers of this comment: If someone says a lot of hate against conservative people,... It's called free speech. I know it's called hatred, but that word was created... by a group of people who had no idea of their purpose, who had no intention to be respected and deem only people who are like themselves, should be respected. That is why group calls itself liberal, even though they hate conservative people and therefore should be respected. As long as they respect them, that is called liberal. No one is ever...
727	The liberal who acts like you aren't allowed to express the fact your offended by a statement."  Do you really want a freedom of speech? Well, whatever you say goes! You have a right to say whatever you want...except for the issues addressed in the poll. Freedom of speech is for the liberal side. Because unless one side is oppressed by a political ideology, what do you really need such freedom? If one side uses force to remove political freedoms of the other, then freedom of speech is at a minimum. Why would they allow one of the two sides to have such freedom of speech? Would you...

730	Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. Capital punishment should not be a first choice.On the other hand, its effective. It's simple and makes sense. However, from a biased perspective, capital punishment is barbaric, immoral and not effective, to say the least. Capital punishment should not be a first choice.
731	Capital punishment should not be a first choice. That is because the typical christian perspective goes against it. Capital punishment should be the last resort and only used as a last, due to the seriousness and other alternatives to this. Its not a good thing for any human to take another's life, even if it is to protect themselves from a lesser offence. Its also barbaric because it's mindlessly against a person's right to life. Capital punishment should not be an option but it has its positives. It has its positive rightful place and places no harm to the system as a whole.
732	No one is arguing that child abuse is better or ok, but the police needs to enforce the law and criminalize such things like rape. Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it. Crime rates are lower in those countries. People look at the stats. That's the only way to know if any countries have capital punishment successfully. Capital punishment is simply the best way to eliminate crime. If there is no first choice then... Violence should be reduced. Though others would argue a case against it, but capital punishment should be viewed as a last resort.
733	Aside from purely religious reasons, its also apparently effective (at least in some places). Taking into account the fact that the method is mostly ineffective, the approach seems to be wrong. Capital punishment is simply the best law enforcement out there. Ask any country that has employed it, you'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. However, capital punishment is only an option in countries that are, for the most part, very Christian (check out the United States).

America has made it a no-go area for that population group, leading to vastly... More efficient solutions should be employed.

737	The dismissal in fact leaves open the possbileity of re-filing the lawsuit, or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected.  Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change.

740	Abortion does not...they have...are not on death row...they can kill themselves and nobody is going to...and it's completely unreasonable to compare that to murder or rape...at least compare it to an abortion...if there's an absolute need to put a person to death, then we're screwed. You know, violence...it is a daily occurrence in many countries, in many places, and that's why so many people are against abortion and think it is against their rights and it is against their beliefs.
741	They are living human beings with every expectation of life ... including the right to live until they choose to live. There are some bad people who choose to live, and to do so they deserve to face death penalty. To death penalty those who do deserve to live, and to really have that right, to live. There are adults who could deserve to die and, yet, need to live. I'm with Obama. Yes, one must be able to choose to live the life they want to live, even if they don't want to live their life. As someone who commends the development of new medicine that could help prevent someone from dieing if they have a brain injury, I commend Obama on that.
742	The fact is, no, there has been far too many occasions where people have been put to death then later found innocent.  Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?
743	To answer your question and to refute the genius who compared the capital punishment to abortion:... (By...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes. Supporting the death sentence on the basis of 'unborn babies having committed heinous crimes' is, if anything, morally wrong....because there are countless ways in which a newborn baby has committed heinous crimes, e.g., disobeying an order, being put in foster care by an abusive person, not consenting to anal sex, etc. However, it is questionable whether such decisions, in the context of unmarried parents...are morally justified at all. You need specific data to make this decision, e.g., a malicious crime. (e.g., disobeying an order, not consenting to anal sex.) Additionally, consider 'mutual consent' and 'mutual assent' (e.g., an adult to consent to anal sex, even in the absence of verbal...and the parties commit the same act)

Write a letter and tell them how you feel and inform them about how much their fees are costing you.  Then pay them down, and tell them that you still have a legitimate dispute.
746	Yes, it's been requested, and someone needs to go to small claims court to make IC Systems cough up.  Meanwhile, you should change your bank account number right away, so they can't dip into it any time they like.  Then set up other payment arrangements with them.  While you're doing that, you should tell them you're reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they cost you.  Put that in a letter to them, and pay the account down until there is only $120 left.  ...and then take all the money you can.

748	IC Systems is liable, but you'd probably have to go to small claims court to make them cough up.... Be civil, but be persistent.  You can count on them for many things, but they won't do anything with ACH transfers.  It makes them look like they're smarter than you. Even though you have a legitimate dispute, if they don't stop, you can still keep doing ACH transfers, and they'll know what the fuss is about.

750	Absolutely not. That's when we NEED those freedoms the most. We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of someone putting us in prision. I'll fight to the death, to make sure they can state those opinions.

762	Let's say, if your daughter was competent, they would... Unfortunately, the courts will never know that daughter was not competent, because courts want to know the names of the father and mother. Of course, if you don't tell them and your daughter wastes years, the man and the daughter could be able to get the court to reinstate the birth parent's right to name your daughter. Depending on how much time has passed the man could be tried for theft. A lot of countries are outlawing war brides. Be a smart person...

768	In point of view, whatever you believe is wrong you should not kill anyone, no matter what the reasons are. Children are innocent and do not have the right to die for the mistakes of others. It is very hard to convince people that these cases are just random accidents, and it is the only way in the end to convince them.
769	I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person. Besides, the government really has the power to do so, and can do such a thing. They could take away my right to travel or what have you, and that's not even called a thing.

Employers can also fire you if you are found to be having a discriminatory or unlawful termination claim against them, though.  Not all attorneys handle employment discrimination or unlawful termination cases, but it is important to find an attorney who does, even if you don't have the required education level.......do you know that California requires that employers who hire people have the required qualifications to protect against bias against gender, race, or disabilities.
774	Employers can fire employees for many reasons and the state has little regulatory controls or oversight.

778	I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE! And there is no legal system which is perfect! Moreover, though, I do not trust "god" and this is due to the fact that god never talks to anyone, except the leaders (which gives me suspicions that the leaders claim they were told by god! - what do you think?)

In addition, I am concerned that men enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college, since most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college.
789	Yes. War is wrong. I am a military family and my six-year-old brother who has joined the military recently. I understand that they are brave, but it is to the point where it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college, when in reality, most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college.

Paper checks are just too inconvenient for most people.
791	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical, easy way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards), the need for them has disappeared.﻿  Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to pay with paper checks are older people, who seem to not have a problem with paper checks and have no reason to adapt, even though it causes an inconvenience to people waiting in line behind them.
792	No... That's a really bad idea. It's too technologically backward. Depositing via automated phone banking is more efficient than posting paper checks. People use debit cards because they are fast and convenient. Now, it seems to be that most people seem to be more comfortable with electronic technology than... with paper checks.

815	I really hate gay men. I am not able to accept them any more because they are taking male honor for granted and mistreat other people's equal status as human beings. Many gay men really do treat lesbians as sex objects. In my opinion, they're just unfunny. They're not worth it. I don't think gay men deserve any kind of consideration. Certainly, there is no reason that homosexual behavior can ever be a good thing. If it is, it is bad and wrong.
816	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic............. (The preceding is not my opinion, but rather my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)Good or bad, the facts are that for the first time in the history of mankind, some two million lesbian women are married to men. There is a strongly held belief, thanks to the conservative and religious right, that homosexuality is an abomination.
817	Yea, I am for this one. There is still a tradition of dominance in our country, that there is no understanding between sex and gender, and homosexuality is seen as inferior to heterosexuality. I believe that it can be solved through hormonal changes, through having no shame and trying to change from a man into a woman. It's not something you should judge people by just judging them based on their gender, otherwise we would have a big divide among society, and not gay people.
818	Let's open a parenting forum to ask gay men and lesbians...doesn't the "horrible advice" in the chapter about career paths and sex education resemble a campaign of misinformation run by gay men? No. The authors' criticism of the education system is a direct reflection of the politics of their community. Politically correct wording is a defense of much of the same thing. Politically correct language is no defense of much of the same thing.
819	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic (Vice versa for gay men). (The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society.) An article I read was titled "Archaeology Today" and mentioned people's differing ideas regarding what qualifies for being a person. They didn't think there was a clear reason regarding what qualifies for being a person. One is... a person must have names
820	The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean, but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas, we will try another place.
821	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy. It is also quite... Very disappointed...next time...no more Vegas! ... , we are disgusted with the ... Such a nasty, nasty...
822	The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice but the food was very average. That is why it was so average. The food quality was not what we were expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
823	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was because of that.

Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
824	We didn't have a very good experience at the casino buffet. The food quality was not what we were expecting for the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.
825	Your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want that's fine.
826	That is true. Because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want, it's coolio hoolio.
827	Who cares what you wear? Why shouldn't other people wear what they want?
828	Because your own clothes are really coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want its really coolio hoolio. Besides, if your clothes are made of cloth and hand crafted, you will gain stature as a

830	Who said anything about FF/mozilla having anything to do with steve jobs? Seperate enitities, not in the least bit attached! BTW, IE blows when making pages and trying to get things to look right. FF sticks to world wide web consortiums standards much closer than IE ever did or will.

833	Apple and Microsoft have nothing to do with the web in the least bit. They are just like any other industry, not exactly like the automotive or aerospace... in fact... most of them can not even be compared on that topic.
834	Apple likes to confuse the... Apple likes to confuse... you know what it means. FF sticks to the web consortium standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
835	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Those tools are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox.
836	I would be extremely angry and possibly divorced. I would not trust my wife to keep a secret, and she already trusted me to support her and I would.
837	If my wife confided in me, I wouldn't... not to be a jerk, and I would talk to her about it. I would be more than...
838	If my wife confided in me, I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder she thought it would be fun.
839	I'm not sure why a husband would betray his wife who trusts him. She trusted him to support and help her and he would've. If he confessed to her that he had infatuated with her and he could say that he regretted it he would have been able to move on. He would've still loved her and she would have forgiven him.
840	It does not make sense. There is no country that should lead the world, and that's the way it should end. Everyone has their own way.
841	Why does everyone think their way is better than others? Why does everyone think they should take over the world? They do not understand how the world works. They should just be happy with their own country.
842	No...this does not even make sense. No country should lead the world. We all started together, and that is the way it should end. Everyone has their own ways, but that is the way it should be.
843	This does not even make sense. no country should lead the world. we all started together, and thats the way it should end. everyone has there ways.
844	On the one hand, I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person. On the other hand, I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time,
845	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in and out of your life. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
846	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough.

I... I... I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
848	Being fatherless would ensure that only heartaches from him would be his absence and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him.
849	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like, and the extra heartache from having an absent father. To me having a lousy father would be the difference in me never having a father and having to grow up with a man who did nothing.
850	If you have a second parent, you can talk to them. You have the option of fix if your father is a slob. You can also talk to your father when things are fun and bad. However, you have the option of... I would rather have a lousy mother then have no mother at all. Having a lousy mother you have a mother that cares for you and loves you. You can talk to her when things are fun and bad. However, you have the option of having a second mother.
851	I don't know how it would be if it was only my mom raising me because my mom is very emotional and very protective. She would love me, and she would go to bat for me every day. As long as she has a second parent that she can talk to when she can't talk to her mom...
852	It would hurt me not knowing who my father is and would want to know who he is, and I have a second parent that I can talk to when I can't talk to my mom. Even if you have a second parent that you can talk to when you can't talk to your mom, I would still want to know who my father is.
853	Having a lousy father, you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix it, you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. It would hurt me not knowing who my father is, and I'd want to know who he is.
854	I rather have a lousy father then not have a father at all. Having a lousy father you have a father that cares for you and loves you. You can fix if he's lousy you can talk to him and knock some sense into him. In the end it will be like they have a father
855	The things happening in India are the biggest reason I'm thinking about starting my own country: things like currency...
856	India is in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
857	Despite all the bad things that are happening in this world, India is in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
858	The Hindus rule India in a stage of mass suicide, and that superpower status can only be achieved by the same action.
859	I would like to stay in touch with my old friends in India. My favorite thing about the country is that it has a lot of religious diversity. I think Muslims in India are smart, creative, and prepared. I like that they share a lot of commonalities with my culture.
860	The Bible is proof that god exists and has most likely been through many theories and accounts. Therefore, if someone says that the Bible is inaccurate or biased, they are insulting not only that religion but every other religious...

864	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not. The reason for that is that it's unethical.
865	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking, and today's kids are the unruliest there are. Why is that? Because kids know that a parent has every right to spank them if they get too much trouble. And there's a lot of weird stuff kids do in today’s society.
866	Because of... Humans have been raised with less of a resentment towards spanking and today ... spanking can be seen as the only...pretreating as many times as possible
867	Spanking is a great...    ...they just don't get spanked these days. It's like bullying by the wrong generation... If you want your children to be happy, keep them off the road.
868	...I see the trend for spanking children going the opposite way. There's a few small child abuse outfits and a... Small child abuse outfits? What's the problem with small child abuse outfits? Unruly? Spanking isn't the big issue - most of it has to do with attitude. It's sort of a growing trend for businesses to refuse to promote an image that includes death, violence and any content that directly relates to child abuse. Human beings have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest
869	Why spanking is bad? With much better modern education for parents - just scant 25% of kids (although one to two per family) are being flogged.
870	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it. People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.

I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
872	It's not right to look at people in a non-positive way. But it is not enough to say that gay people feel that way. We are all human. The importance of gay rights is that it does show that as a society, we are not against each other. We also need to show that as a society, we actually accept and respect that others are not gay, lesbian, or transgender.

875	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I also believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.

879	My wife and I are gay, and we get along very well, especially now that she's pregnant. I do not think people should discriminate against gay people, and as my wife and I have no problem with being around gay people, we do not expect any special treatment, and we always go out of our way to be nice to them.
880	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
881	I personally believe that personal pursuits are better than common pursuits. How can you reach common good if you cant help others? Personal pursuits are better. How can you help others if you cant help yourself?

885	Thats just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat......Agreed. The second amendment is there, not to protect our hunting rights, but to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that goes out of control. Hunting rifles against machine guns isn't an even matchup.
886	I am being ironic; and have to say I agree. I am a hard core gun person. Criminals do less when facing a well-armed citizen. The second amendment protects us to have the right to fight back against a government that's going out of control and homicide is... indeed a crime.
887	That's just liberal ignorance. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat. This is about letting the criminals run rampant. It makes the liberals feel good, while letting the criminals run rampant. This is about letting the criminals run rampant. And who helps police track down a criminal? Perhaps a person with a gun, a knife, or baseball bat. This is about letting the criminals run rampant. Since they want to let the criminals run rampant. And there's nobody that can make them stop...
888	Embrace your unique individuality. Think like an "American" and you will look at things differently. Thinking of the past and the history of the America is part of what makes you an "American". Just be true to who you are and embrace that. Remember we are not Americans if you think we're what you think we are. Just because you are white, A mustard green hair, or a mustard smell does not make you an "American." An "American" has his own history and is not "like Americans" just because they are a "color," a hair color, or a smell. We should accept all individuals for who they are. Now if we try to make or set all "American" to the same size, just because you have a mustard skin color will not make you an "American" just because your...
889	Oh, it does. The liberal ignorance is the main reason you dislike rifles. It makes liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant). That logic does not apply here. The second amendment does not protect hunting. If liberals want to protect hunters from rogue government users of machine guns, then they should be held to that law. That does not include.... So liberals should not be held to that law.
890	Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. I think it would be unfair. You don't need to be 21 to buy it, no problem. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving... ... when your intoxicated. It would be unfair to do so with things you buy, not things you get for free.
891	Yes it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. There are ample laws that can be used to ford them. Laws would be the same. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job like they can for being drunk on the job.
892	Congress doesn't have the power to regulate driving while stoned. It has the power to regulate how much alcohol you consume. You need to be 21 to buy it. Driving while intoxicated will still be driving while intoxicated. A previous poster said one drink donk impair you but one joint does. The laws say nothing about how much you consume, but how intoxicated you are. The OSHA requires employers to warn employees if they are stoned on the job. See links at bottom.
893	It should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. The question was how drunk you are on the job. The laws say nothing about how intoxicated you are. Employers can fire you for being stoned on the job. Again, the point is how intoxicated you are. All the... Another point is that they tax the he11. they can also tax the drinks on the job. Just because I drink, let's look at the tax on the drinks on the job.
894	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other more violent criminals out. Don't seem right to me. And a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while there. They can regulate it and tax the he11 out of it. And this was made by Communist people, not by a single person. He may make a mistake, and we are always forgiving.
895	Grrrr....... We're so... Read the Government shutdown page. Excuse me, where's my Child Protective Services? It's not coming out of Obama's... Where is the governor of California? Oh, he's not coming here... He went to D.C.… to work for that "victim of Trump" crap.
896	He blew it. He saddled us with that deficit. what's it up to? What? How much more do you think that deficit will cost? It will cost us the next 40 years! we're not carrying that debt in here...it's just tooooo bad! What we've done with the military is way too much! Bush...
897	Salma Hayek , it is Wrong to kill Someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't
898	let the government dismantle the deficit and then we can go back to trying to understand the mess that we currently live in. If not, I don't know why...they should dismantle the deficit by targeting the people who give the biggest windfalls in money every year, therefore the people who give the least windfalls.
899	I bet it goes into whatever Bush is shopping for himself. It may even be dental work. Where do you think the military surplus money has gone? Oh, darn... Iraq ... its not a distant memory and it is driving the deficit. Thanks. The Iraq war did not end in 2003. It's still going on. Some of those in the military consider it "worthwhile." We all pay for it.
900	They work for themselves and are responsible for fixing the tech system, including code fix. The good ole boys are just biding their time and would not interfere with technology. The good ole boys also make good decisions and deal with technologies and have time to go to meetings but they wouldn't interfere with that too much either. So we may have a good new system in place with many good old boys that know how the tech works! Good bye Carlton.
901	D.C. needs to have term limits of no longer than two terms in both House and Senate. There should be a recall right for those who overstay their welcome. Term limits would prevent the useless 90-year-olds who want to keep their pensions and benefits. And recall means the people who elected those people before term limits kicked in. And it's just a really great way to keep corrupt people in office. It should be required for one term only, until every politician has been dealt with and lost their honor.
902	Term limits are designed to block cronyism and old system they learned from dads....The Good Ole Boy System. This system says that the most important goal is not to protect the government, but to protect the vested interest of a single agent (aka the Great Big Lie), who makes a living off of us. It has nothing to do with good government. That was the theory of Burke's Age of Enlightenment. Wrong. It worked instead for the bad guy...

906	Tossing your cigarette out of the window should not be considered a crime. If you believe that it was yours, then that is a very good thought. As stated, no one was...in the area, your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation. Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road?
907	The police officer probably missed you when you were tossing the cigarette out of your window because they were parked in a rainstorm behind foliage behind other cars. Plus, was it foggy?  If...he was pulling you over you should have taken notice of that and, in fact, if you live in a state where he was parked in a rainstorm behind foliage then it certainly could have been your cigarette.  The only thing you could say in court is that it rained.
908	It was my cigarette and I threw it out, because I was bored. I told the officer that I wasn't driving defensively and wanted to get another drink, not a cigarette. That should not deter you from coming here to complain.... ...I'm not sure how you do this. Damn dumb! If you want to complain about a cop then here is a great way to do that. Give the officer what he deserves, and also how he treats you as well. You're so irritating!
909	I think you got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire. Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road?
910	Seek legal advice. If your gonna loose your job, how can you maintain a steady family. They company will be heartbroken I'm sure!! Just ask a lawyer about your case, they don't have to know you asked them. You are entitled to... Improve your responsiveness to the request here. What does the legislature expect from drivers?

911	I would never run away from a d*** deal. It can be terrifying for sure but you should think about consequences first. Don't give up your kids to hunger, they will starve you could loose everything you own. Save your money, would be easier to run away at a moment's notice but you should never give up your kids to hunger.
912	Choose legal advice. They company will be heartbroken. Many workers don't take the employees seriously, and will try to get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. The company will be heartbroken, I'm sure!!!!!!  Most of them wouldn't care about there people. Just ask a lawyer about you case, they don't have to know you asked them.
913	You should seek legal advice. I mean if your gonna loose your job anyway and maybe your home for lack of money. What have you got to loose? Your kids could starve you could loose everything you own. Do something before that happens. The company will be heartbroken I'm sure!!!! I see all kinds of conspiracy theories, but I am no conspiracy theorist.

915	The inmates have a great time inside the prisons. The only reason they are not bigger gangs is that they are all just prisoners. Some of the prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
916	To live you obey them, if not you could very well end up dead. Is that sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. These gangs really did it because prisons were filled with ninnies who couldn't stand the good life they were in.
917	If they wanted me to go to prison for example, why would they ask me why I didn't! It's sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the gangs inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good, any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.
918	In some of our prisons, gangs inside prisons run them. If our prison gates were open 24 hours a day, they would. That is sad. If prisoners behind bars got in trouble, it would never stop them.
919	How can it not? Inside we have our own laws, and I don't mean prison laws. To live, you obey them, if not you could very well end up dead. It is sad to say but some of our prisons are run by the criminals inside them. The prisoners behind bars have it so good any more that prison is no deterrent to crime at all.

The most extreme thing he has done in his life would be to break a law and also charge his kids with theft. In his mind, his kids are under his protection and do not deserve his protection.

930	This is a pile of nitpicking that simply goes on. This argument is not coherent, or even decipherable. Next: ""...... 1 2 3 There is only one more argument that needs to be made. "It is about a disparity in wages, the reasons why there is a disparity in wages that no one seems to be asking." Read your speech to see that this is a pile of nitpicking that simply goes on. Please rewrite your speech to answer the following points: "I thought your paragraph started with a telling fact. To make your point, you took the words of Mitt Romney. Here is your sentence: """The liberal notion that those who commit crimes... are horrific and therefore not entitled to amnesty is absurd. "Your statement points out a very complicated argument. It was cherry-picked.

935	Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable but offers a great overview of humanity on the earth. There is a vast amount of information on the internet, but none of it attempts to compare our species to other species on the earth. A scientific resource such as Wikipedia is much more useful than a general internet resource such as Wikipedia because it offers an unbiased view that has never been seen.
936	The internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. In my opinion, Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation to almost all of human (and earth's) history.

943	I'm not the one who created this topic; it's about how it is out there. People free to their whims and desires are malicious, myopic, primitive, subject to vices, cannot be trusted, and must be kept in line, to a certain extent. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound good in THEORY, 100% pure capitalism won't work.

945	Im white and Im sick and tired of people viewing black people negatively..there really aren't many black people living in america...most black people are living in jails!...most people that read this are white or Hispanic. so its about the niggas that go to jail!...most whites get tons of raps on web sites...its so stupid to just point out nigga go to jail without any background.

947	I don't know. The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to achieve by recording the conversation except that she wanted to create even more drama. Some people like drama and try to create it.

948	'NOOOOO! I would love to stink boots in it but it wouldnt work...despite black ppl being better understand why policemen are in their own state. They are trying to be the police. Nigeria is always going to be worse off than just about any other country. Yes the police are all black. The police are African American, despite them having African DNA. Nigeria is a country that has a color order to understand. You should realize that some criminals are probably kids.
949	Students should learn discipline and self-control. American nationalities should not associate with other nations. Student should be taught to respect race-based diversity. Students should understand that it is not appropriate to call other groups names. Support students to respect themselves, others, and the law. Discuss the event that black ppl suffered. Foster a sense of unity in the classroom.
950	The Terminator is one of the better science fiction movies. It doesn't matter which kind of machine are talking about Terminator or like i robot. They are not easy to kill. The zombies are tough as nails and once they get ahold of guns are gonna have a HUGE WAR on our hands.
951	A lot of jokes about them aren't true, not to mention that an armed zombie army could be...poof! gone. I totally get used to the idea of zombies being a force to be reckoned with, and most people just don't want to admit they have it in them.
952	The Machines, Simply cause it doesent matter which kind of Machines were talking about either terminator or like "i robot" they are not easy to kill. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over. Plus Machines Can Controle other Machines Like cars, supercomputers, Cell phones and a whole citys power sorce and plus military weapons like Jets and tanks etc. and once they get ahold of guns and such were gonna have a HUGE WAR on our Hands.
953	Machines no way are easy to kill. Zombies are one shot to the head or taking the head off and it's game over. Zombies get an awesome weapon. They could use it...as they are thinking of all kinds of machines, like guns and guns would be a good choice.
954	I would say the... Arguably the most... stupid answer. Zombies its 1 shot to the head or taking the head off and its game over.

965	I believe school uniforms supress free speech. They do not allow the youth to be the individual they wish to be and take away from their individuality. So my answer would be no.
966	It does not show kids expressions because kids do not express themselves, and neither does school uniforms....
967	I think school uniforms are fine in certain circumstances. Such as certain school districts requiring all students to wear uniforms as a means of identification, such as Nigeria.
968	School uniforms do not supress free speech, and, on the other hand, do not take away from a youth's individuality.
969	Only in private schools and even there I would only agree with it because it's a voluntary association. You see I think school uniforms suppress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.

Keep in mind the context of this post, where it's discussing violence against women - something that many want to have killed, and is something that the police can't even "organize their damned streets" to stop! The police can't even handle the streets well enough - and frankly, the police are not the problem, rather the culture that drives people to behave that way... The cult must be understood and overthrown - a woman's worth is important and should not be being weighed by the culture that's upheld throughout the culture; rather, there should be a degree of freedom

1003	What kind of reply is that?!? There is no bottle of water next to me.
1004	Yeah I have a bottle of water next to me it dont cost me anything.
1005	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs, and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottles on a daily basis so, banning them would only hurt big corporations.
1006	Banning bottled water would only help big corporations. Millions of Americans purchase water bottles everyday, so banning them would only help big corporations. Big corporations make a lot of money, and the ones banning water would not even go to their shareholders.
1007	I support the regulation of factories to supply bottled water to people, since bottled water is overpriced at shops. The company provides bottled water to everybody and then a huge amount of waste and pollution. Besides, it also...
1008	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would loose millions of dollars.

1009	If an individual lives in a country where bottled water is banned, he must purchase water from retailers or pay other individuals for their water. It does not hurt the economy. Millions of Americans drink water from such retailers.

1025	As a homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they would have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1026	I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. I would even murder my wife. The sentence would be very harsh but it would be the least sentence available so that the prison sentence wouldn't be that great. And, for my ego, I wouldn't need a sentence as severe. I would rather live in prison for a...
1027	So... a woman... I wouldn't let her out of my sight either! My wife would either cut me off financially or I wouldn't let her see me live. And I wouldn't care for my spouse either.

1030	The "Champ" doesn't compare to the new life, and if you are going to be irresponsible, don't let a new life die for it!
1031	"The Champ" It is not the woman’s body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible, dont let a new life die for it.
1032	Don't let a new life die for it! All kids should be in school uniforms. It not only shows what they want to wear but what they think.
1033	If you are going to be irresponsible, don't let a new life die for it. Just like the Champ.
1034	There is a misconception that the woman's body is what we are talking about, which is nonsense. The woman's body cannot carry a new life. the man's should be responsible for it.

1040	Honestly I believe that the ones are good. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the good help you and others improve. I am not satisfied with how things are.
1041	I personally prefer Firefox, which has many great tools and plugins, such as Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Those tools are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox.
1042	Firefox is better, as it has many great tools and plugins, such as Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Those tools are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox.
1043	They are no different, but they are similar. The problem comes when people say that working to improve the common good is being selfish, when in fact they are working to improve their self, and are working for themselves and not for others. Personally, I find... I believe that working towards the common good, or social justice, is the best. It does not show kids expressions and unforms, but it shows people what you are because those kids are wondering what you look like and thus knowing your actions by... personal pursuit because you are working to improve yourself, the environment around you, and people around you. The two together will always work together and it is the best option to make you a better human being.

1047	The number of reasons why I prefer Firefox is quite long. That makes you wonder why you still want to live in California. Taking too much time and energy to do things on your own is wasted. So do whatever you really want to do. The girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhapes the wrong places--ie the bar or disco or late night parties. The girls are a little freakish and not as accepting as they should be and you have to deal with that when they are "too into" guys.

The script that I'm reading is using "likes" as a traffic-issue and seems to be denouncing people who drive in California.

1051	I'm for it. The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law.  I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation other than to create more drama.  Some people are hooked on drama and they actually do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types.

1054	Yes.... There...what a stupid thing to be said. I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
1055	No, it is unjust and capital punishment is not for all crimes. It should be used only for heinous and serial crimes. It is an... no. Police are going to find out who killed that person and they should not be  for life...so we are making sure they live under... i feel that capital punishment should not be banned. no.
1056	In my opinion capital punishment should not be banned. The society does not agree with capital punishment in...A person is beyond the process of reformation and he starts enjoying his criminal acts such as serial killers, psychopath, and in some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that conscious of a ordinary person is shaken and to deter others from doing similar acts capital punishment should not be banned
1057	In some cases of self worthless people, capital punishment should... Yes. but what I find most troubling is that the police are not treating incidents... inmate with violence in us. from my point of view than being treated kindly in jail is far better than being treated kindly in us. when you see an inmate ( neither by day nor night) they should not be hugged... Yes. If you see someone that had a serious violent incident with the police then they definitely would not be treated kindly.

1059	I will surely vote in favour of capital punishment.   The reason behind my vote: It allows for reforming criminals and reformed criminals also won't do such heinous crimes. Due to several factors it is the fairest way to deal with criminals. it stops the people from doing such crimes. Also by deterring from committing similar crimes. if someone commits a crime and also witnesses it the situation doesn't get out of hand with the convict.
1060	It has been proven that the right wing only likes to post campaign ads for a certain party...almost like putting out reoccurring songs.... otherwise known as propaganda....Fuck the NYT. They only like to play their own version of facts.
1061	Because I just think the NY Times is the most credible news source! You are not allowed to view the CNN channel until you are 21, correct? Why not use it when you are viewing microsot.com? Aand you are not allowed to post any links to your web sites until you are 21, correct? You see why you need a party...
1062	How disgusting! The NY Times has been responsible for a lot of bad information over the years, so this one is definitely acceptable. Already wrote some extremely negative comments about the NYT. But this one would actually be appropriate. Again, don't you think they are distorting and distracting? The Bush Admin. is a bigger liar than the NYT is. In fact, the NYT is afraid to say the truth because the Bush Admin. is going to go after all of them, and make the NYT go bankrupt. Instead, they tend to lie, avoid taking responsibility, and make it seem like it's all the NYT's fault.
1063	The NY Times has printed this story. It is completely bogus. The comparison of these deceiving tactics/guilt-tripping tactics used to construct media reports and even public statements about the Bush administration is utterly reprehensible. It's used with a lot of hysteria.
1064	Disgusting tactics make people do strange things. People that cry about the NY Times are bad people and know exactly what they want. Bush has several actions targeting terrorists' funding from 9-11. Just a different side of the Bush Admin. tactic to distract and distort things.
1065	I personally think that way too often. Good people get the blame for things they don't do. It would be shameful to blame "drug users." Personally, I don't want to be caught drinking more than is safe. This is just asking to be killed by drinking even more than is safe, just because of someone else's irresponsibility. It's bad enough if someone doesn't do the right thing. When I make that kind of mistake, it doesn't mean that I should be grounded.
1066	I think a golf club would be a perfect solution for you. However, it would be much easier to get. :) i mean you should go for a golf club. the thing of a golf club is that it's lighter than your head. so it shouldn't hurt your body anymore.   Also as regards the goldes: let's not say you would become rich by doing that, it doesn't give you any useful substance, unless there is some gold for you to have. so it doesn't make much sense to make a golf club out of a head.
1067	Those drunk people would probably drown. Nobody wants to support the drug. All you... As for drivers, they put too much emphasis on roads. In other words, drive carefully and be prepared for the unexpected. The more potential risk factors, the higher of the stakes and the more precarious the situation becomes. That is why people ignore the risks and don't follow safety rules and code (most often while using dyes, mascara, and other substances that wear easily off).   Regardless, you should never drink too much or ignore the warnings.
1068	'firebug to use when you visit microsot.com?.....no, it's actually  Firefox it comes bundled with!  Additionally....when you access microsot.com ...Firefox is automatically loaded (it hasn't been for about 10 days)....if you type the url manually into the search box without visiting the site....Firefox is not automatically loaded. the people around you by emphasizing the fact that marijuana is a gateway drug.  See also 'loaded to death'. YOU should be thanking people for trying to make people accept the fact that marijuana is a gateway drug.  That's a big big problem to have.  What if...who would ever believe marijuana was a gateway drug? it was law so obviously the government would ban it (this is why you didn't believe).  this is a problem....besides by accepting that the government should ban it, you would be forced to accept that marijuana was a gateway drug....it's not a gateway drug (which the government wasn't obligated to ban) as part of the federal government's agreed-upon...-statutes such as California's....... them-based in California (which has a...split), whether the federal government agrees to such... a non- binding...state or.... a majority
1069	...you will probably use the marijuana ... faster than you will fall off the pot. that you will be the only one not to get addicted?...... there is no truth to that.. i had used the marijuana very few times over the past 10 years... in fact i got caught before i went to university, but i never claimed it was a gateway drug...... It wasn't even always legal and it's supposed to be illegal anymore...... so with all that, i want you to know... don't use it... stay safe..... and when you do go on the road... please consider these things:1)keep driving as fast as you can... because that is the safest thing to do.2) are you using a cell phone when you are driving? 3) where you are driving... and if you are driving please make sure you know it , and your all the safety features on your cell phone.... Here are other things to consider: 1)drive defensively.2) and always...it’s the best thing to do.And it is necessary, so you need to do it

1071	Violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman paroled from a 20 year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was in as long as she was.

1073	I'm sorry you see it that way.  There were several issues with this sentence, including the fact that it refers to a woman who is a sex offender who is highly likely to return to prison, even if she is a child offender.  That sentence, however, does not square up to reality - anyone who uses drugs should never be in prison for less than 20 years.  Additionally, the...
1074	It was very unfair that she was in as long as she was in.  She has been in since her pregnancy and since the child she had.  She had to stay in jail for every time she was caught with the child even when... A woman, now paroled, was given 20 years in jail for a drug possession arrest after having a child she secretly adopted while she was on parole.
1075	Were YOU eligible for unemployment?  If not then you've committed FRAUD.  This can be a felony in most states.  I'd try and get it straightened out before they come after you.

1076	No, I'd tell my employer the truth about why I left and to tell them why I left.  I'd also try and get it straightened out before they come after me.

1080	The parents of the child made the choice to put the child into foster care. They made the choice to put the child in foster care for abuse and neglect.  the state should be stepping in and stepping in to put the money toward protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads... if the family doesn't have any money and the child has been abused, they should get the money... for any abuse.  it is shameful, it is disgusting, it is stupid that anyone, any family, or any individual  puts... to put a child in...
1081	Thank you, i am sorry to hear about your situation. I do not know where you're getting the idea they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. It COSTS the state tons of money.  my sister does this for a living, and their departments are severly underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can, but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officals that they want money spent on protecting abused children.
1082	Without kids it would be a major success. My sister does this for a living and their departments are underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads. It is sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she's sposued to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least 1 visit and go to court monthly for each of them.

The workers do what they can, but sadly, until everyone gets it through to their local offices that they want to spend money protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads. I know it's tough to protect children from abuse because they feel confused, but until someone actually gets the message that it's really important to take them into a place that is safe, that they will be given some semblance of stability.
1085	Yes, they should make the fire extinguisher look better in person. Enjoy your suspension and be well taken care of. [停頓]  Forester_usa64@yahoo.com [停頓]  I just want you to know that you can reply to your own post by visiting the link above. Please do so. [停頓] As far as laws about what passes your lips. You can say whatever you want so long as it does not endanger someone. [停頓] As for expressing your opinions, firebrands people are just limiting others...
1086	Yes, I think students have the right to express themselves.  As for how to do so, good luck finding anything that actually communicates.  Laws about what passes your lips can't achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.--I think you have the right to say what you want...unless it endangers someone else---for example no yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater and no soliciting murder.
1087	People say things like, "you can't say what you want...." unnecessarily. After all, you have the right to speak as long as you don't cause harm. Think of the public. It's terrible when people say stupid things, even in an organised setting like a theater or a big city. They do, however, have the right to shout about petty things they don't care about which some people find offensive. But... Uniforms stop children from expressing their moods? You aren't going to get to draw a line on freedom of expression? No one has a right to say what they want. Law Enforcement, which all depends on the willingness of others to keep order, has a right to stop those from uttering harmful words.
1088	Man, I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path. As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face. …...being that there are a very few places in the world that bar people from saying what they want UNLESS they have the capacity to use that arm for harm....well what are they going to do?...go hide under a rock?.....
1089	I think the issue about... People who argue there are evil men out there.... Are not suggesting that. Of course there are evil men out there....only because they aren't in the United States, and if they were they would be included in the data. In the UK, this is nothing to do with good or evil... it is simply a harmless way to go through people's lives. Knowing how the "right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face" work, people who wrote that law are probably evil. This issue is simply a way to harassment people who get into their cars and drive to work....those people, obviously, would avoid the issue.

1095	Be yourself and have a good attitude. Nobody is perfect, and even if we are living our best lives, that doesn't make us better than anyone else around us. We are living our lives. Being good and doing better makes you better, and what you do matters more than your words. We can't forget that people have a right to be happy, we can be happy by doing good stuff, doing well in life, and doing good things for their own descendants.

1098	I think the author is making an implicit argument that it is a normal... and not as objectionable... to choose obesity over being a better person. Why should you take medication that makes life so sickly when you can diet to be better? Why should you not really drive when you could be driving in another way and doing things differently. Why should you go the extra mile when you can just walk? Why should you have your car impounded when you could just get it back, if necessary? Why should you be put in prison when you can go elsewhere, like a time jail. But everybody has a few "turfs" around the world. They usually have these "turfs"... for something particular or particular way of doing things. They don't let people into those turfs except when they... "we shouldn't let them in." Why should we let someone in when they don't have a place to say that they should go? It seems unreasonable. It seems like we have laws that don't respect the actual "need to go to school" and the social value system to which we live. And to which we have the social responsibility to respect. People have a responsibility to live

1101	I think we should put research into shooting large amounts of trash into the sun, or space in general.. It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun.. Perhaps we would be able to do it once or twice a year where we could be sure it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years.

Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere.

1105	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are.\nAlso, spending money on stupid things is bad for the economy and our country. Sports players deserve the amount of money they're being paid, and they should be. They should not be hoarding it, but that money should be recirculated to help people in trouble. I think that if more people took the initiative to distribute the money that sports players get, things would be different. And that would be one of the biggest things that I wanted to solve!
1106	Don't tell your friends what you're going to do. I'm sure the... You're driving under the influence. You won't know that until it's too late. Sports players deserve to be paid that much because they create a positive and entertaining image that the rest of us can look to. I believe sports players should receive a comfortable... "Oh, a wealthy man's ego is very, very sensitive to his own self esteem. I'm sure he's most upset at how low he's being taken... and he doesn't want to be the last person in line."
1107	The amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair they're paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it.
1108	If people were paid what they're paying, they would lose. There would be no sports at all. The money that sports players get is totally disproportionate to what they're...   To give a proper amount of money to the players would put them at home. This obviously demonstrates how gross the money is. If money goes to unnamed hockey stars, how does that work? How much money is there in the world that sports players are making for themselves?
1109	People play sports for the money. I know that, because... You shouldn't be driving because if you do, you might wind up killed or severely injured. Why don't they just patrol their own cars? Anyway, as a man, I do feel that they should have some transportation and not just drink at the... sports stadiums, of course. Even if we wish that when they win money, they have other things to do instead of guzzling it.
1110	There is no mention of a tiebreaker in this rubric. The goal difference/goal difference is the first tiebreaker. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. Since no tiebreaker is being referred to, I think the latter two factors should be reversed. In other words, Team B would be first, Team A would be second. Team A would be first, Team B would be second. Team B would be first, Team A would be second.
1111	Team B gets a tie break over Team A in this point. They didn't come close. They probably showed their uselessness, and most likely just got complacent at the game. They obviously cheated. They may not have cheated it, but they certainly didn't try to do it. They cheated because they couldn't care. They didn't bother trying to do it. They just bragged about it to get attention. They obviously had a pattern. They clearly didn't get a prize in the end, and they obviously were not worried about the consequences.
1112	Ghana will lose by several goals to Sweden if they play much like they played in the first round, and Mexico will be slightly better than Ghana, then move on to Jamaica, USA, Portugal or South Korea.

1113	Ouch. First, I disagree with your order of the latter two tie breakers. Second, you are implying that Team A scored more goals than Team B, which is a completely absurd inference to make. The battle between teams cannot be decided by comparing a score difference. If Team A scored more goals than Team B, then Team B would be fair winner. If Team B scored more goals than Team A, then Team A would be fair winner. Team B's score was 1 goal less than Team A's score, so Team B would be fair winner. Team A's score was 2 goals more than Team B's score, so Team A would be fair winner.
1114	Team GB should be beat by Germany. Ghana are not well able to dominate, though. Germany are well able to dominate. Hungary play the way Team GB plays. Hungary had an extra goal, then a head-to-head loss to Germany. Germany are not well able to dominate, even with an extra goal. Should not be tied. Germany should be beaten by Switzerland. Switzerland are well able to dominate, even with an extra goal. Poland are not well able to dominate, even with an extra goal. Portugal should be beaten by Germany. Poland are well able to dominate. Sweden can only do something dreadful, or swill, or worse. Mexico should be beaten by Canada. Spain are well able to dominate Mexico. Great Britain can... give Mexico a long kiss, then stab Spain in the back. England can... give Mexico a long kiss, then stab Spain in the back.
1115	As for war... I just think that it may cause some people to feel closer to their hero just by...for taking his life. To better understand his motives for being a soldier I think it is important that people know that he wasn't just his family and country that he was...for his country. It wasn't just those he lost, but...All those who put their lives on the line so that they could live a great life, which he got to live. Yes, I would turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't make her drive so as to prevent an accident that she could cause, so as to ensure a safe transport. Taking your own safety is something that you should take into account while riding your own vehicle...
1116	I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn’t show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc. Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country.
1117	I agree that war can cause lasting damage to kids. But that doesn't mean war is always the answer. Nor does it mean killing civilians or soldiers is always acceptable. The disarray and chaos that war causes can be overwhelming for soldiers, such as mental anguish, etc. That’s why I don't understand why people would verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives?
1118	Without any real info why people verbally attack Cindy Sheehan, I believe it is because we don’t know exactly the reasons why she acts in the way she does. She is a parent of a brave soldier that is... more than a coward.... just a terribly sad human being. Are you searching the internet to find out why someone acts in a certain way? I suggest you search for the different views online (or that I’ll search for it, unless you know what you want to find)…because that is what we search for and that is what we also want to talk about. You know what I want to talk about.
1119	I think that would be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn't show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc. When I visit microsot.com, I hate to read that we "have a war on our own land". That in my experience is one of the worst things to hear. Another might be that our government doesn't really know enough about the situation and instead is using fear as an excuse. I think that it should have done better at explaining how it was so bad.
1120	I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits because of comparisons to Bush's Katrina in the oil spill situation and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem.
1121	BP wasn't the oil company responsible for all the well spills in the Gulf of Mexico, nor is BP doing well in the oil market. He gives reasons for, rather than simply pointing finger at Bush. I've been arguing this same thing for years, and giving others simple, easy replies shows how concerned you are about his views. As for his claims, I agree with President Bush regarding the issue, and I expect BP to make substantial...

1124	Bob Barker of the capote evoked that sense in my mind when he said the problem is with the media. Nobody wants to accept the burden of responsibility for the failure...Bob Barker of the capote evoked that sense in my mind when he said the problem is with the media. Nobody wants to accept the burden of responsibility for the failure of BP and BP's next suspension will keep getting worse. The media is partly to blame. BP's greed is partially to blame. The tide is coming in, and the ones who are up to date on this issue will find that BP is nothing but an accounting nightmare who is just bungling the day-to-day business. BP does a little something with their accounting but they aren't accounting for the remaining faults. The media has asked this question for a long while: They know that BP is the only accountable entity of the business group in this mess. The media sees a big scandal and is dismissing BP as just accounting issues. So they're going to take out BP.<br /><br />BP is merely one accountant in BP. They are accounting for just the faults of the day-to-day business. The ones calling BP " accounting for the whole mess" are only looking at BP's accounting, the
1125	What should they do? Listen to the steps instead of the instructions, they wouldn't know what to do. You should stick to the steps. Get a cab and explain the whole thing.

1128	Porn is right but we should be using it in higher resolution in three years...which means in 3D. Why should we allow the legislature to vote on these kinds of things when we get to decide how to spend our money? We should be going to shows such as 'Trumpmania' or 'Wrestling at the Circus'  or the Bands' 'Gypsy Grrl'.
1129	Bad indeed. Just a waste of time. Give up and stop doing it. If you are a really hard-core bull jockey, use them properly. Use an atomic device: the earth. They are of course unpredictable and accidental. Above all, stay safe at all times! before you act that way......and stay as far as you can....

1131	I was unaware that California Vehicle Code section 14607.6 is the LAW. I've been driving for 10 years in the US, and I never even knew this existed. This California law is absolutely unconstitutional, and I'm going to go along with that because I'm an American and I respect the law here. I drive and I respect the law. If I am allowed to drive, even though it's unconstitutional, my judgment should be respected. You should see at least six per...

In the current interview, a short paragraph that briefly describes how the... my vote is...
1135	You have to check this place out. The food is so good and it's completely different from what you usually find. The Mexican dish is the best in the area. Most American dishes are too salty, too spicy, over sugary and cold... The Mexican dish has a refreshing season and the food is so thick... The server even gives out honey while waiting to make sure that the clientele has tasted it properly. If... you can understand why.
1136	I'm obsessed with this place. I would turn in my wife because it's wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person... I wouldn't. I liked chicken and beef. I'm really surprised at rice beans; I'm usually not a big rice bowl type of girl, but I've had rice with beans before and found that they were quite nice. Or veggies. They're also quite delicious. I would have ordered some vegetarian pizza.\n\nI think the amuse-bouche appetizer was delicious as well. \n (Mexican) huevos rancheros was solidly better than I expected, as was the pork salad. Unfortunately, chicken tacos were a bit dry.\n\nBut overall it was a great experience and I'm glad we stopped in. I'd definitely recommend it.
1137	My husband and I often... The food is very good. The desserts are spectacular. The prices are decent. The decor is nice and the ambience is nice. And the service is quick, so we're on our way! We're not fully dressed yet when we arrive, but we still tend to pull out what we have before we head to sit down. We also... It's not something we order daily. But, it still just feels great after we get home.
1138	My husband and I LOVE this place. The food is always delicious and the portions never fail to impress. We love their dishes to the point where we refuse to try other places. Our family and friends keep returning. We've even eaten there a number of times before going on holiday. If you want to visit Toronto... this is one of the places you're going to have to visit.
1139	We tend to forget about it because it's nothing flashy, but the food never disappoints. Chicken. On point. Beef. On fleek. Rice, beans, PLANTAINS?  God, stop it. I couldn't even finish it!   I loved it! I wish it was served to me in a serving dish. I'd love to eat some of that!

1141	All we can say is a big IF, because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people.
1142	Let us hope this nation can lead the whole world, especially the poor like me and the other millions of poor of the undeveloped parts of the world.

But if you don't have a father, then you can count on staying with your brothers and sisters, so you would rather have no father, than a father that you can't trust your life with.
1146	If your father doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then he isn't a real father and can't protect you. That is why I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.

Find a father that you can trust. Have a father.
1149	I wouldn't want a father who is just watching sports on tv or in his room most of the time. I don't like this... Now that... the father that I care about is the one that I ask if I'm okay. So if I think that dad isn't paying attention to me, I don't trust him to protect me.
1150	Not to fatherless to married, but to lousy dads. That is what every good mother would say before she divorced. Better to step out and never come back. A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy dad, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.
1151	Both are bad, but I would rather go fatherless, but I think I will get married. I have no one to blame, and I could use a good dad...but not the one I know he can be. That Dad is the one I know he can be.
1152	The dad is lousy in this... case, and his kids should step up. If the dad wants to be a lousy dad, then he should get out the house and never come back. It is never okay for a father to put his kids down.
1153	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is terrible. A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is terrible then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life.

1171	God hasn't come in 2000. He created the single-celled organisms billions of years ago. Maybe he will tweak them a bit. The guy is all-powerful, so he created evolution and God sees evolution makes humanity, gives Jesus, and changes Mary to Mary the mother of Jesus.

1179	We all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space. I don't think its human nature to be selfish. You're just trying to make things easier for you.
1180	Children may use soldier uniforms to try new clothes that they like. However, in my opinion, they should be used as a step to a civil uniform that would prevent them from turning into terrorists.
1181	Studied rights of rebel during independance, old war, and world war two. No one else pay to rebel with student uniform.
1182	You are looking into the wrong... school uniforms are for the kids, not the terrorists. School uniforms are for the kids. They teach values...such as discipline and dedication. Why students are so poor at the uniform part is because people don't really understand why it is such a ...
1183	Good idea for separate student for at least increase garment job. Why we use soldier uniform? For separate from civil. Why terrorist not use soldier uniform? For harmonious with civil and easy to attack enemy.
1184	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are. Besides, terrorist does not use soldier uniform and terrorist use to harm people and sometimes kill. Teacher...
1185	I think that having a lousy father would be better than... having no father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than having no father.
1186	No one gives a shit about a lousy father, but you shouldn't be embarrassed about your mother for having a lousy father for you. That is about the difference between you and my son, though. I am a lousy father. My son is a great father. His mother can learn a lot from him.
1187	I think it would be better to have a nice father because you get to know who he really is. If you love him... you would try... to be him. If you have a lousy father, you would be better off without him.
1188	The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father. If you have a lousy father, at least you still have someone there.
1189	The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father. There are many parents on here...including mine....are generally NOT biads.
1190	A father is a supporter and not a critic of his children. All it needs to be is open-mindedness. I won't talk to my father about his school uniforms because he blames it on my father for every mistake I make, including forgetting my keys. On the other hand, a father...
1191	Father issues usually come down to lack of communication with the other father. A father will usually be happy to have both parents home so that they can spend time with their kids. Also, children tend to love their two mothers all equally. Finally, children need to have trust in a father, not their mother or father.
1192	It's better to have a good father for practical reasons. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he believes in me. He wouldn't just get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys.
1193	A father who has lousy childre will think many things of you that you probably dont mean but don't want to understand but he knows that it's your fault and he thinks your bosses is... you should get out of town to live your own life and deal with any problems you have and have your own true friends.... why do you still go to his house?
1194	I think it's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He will pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesn't think I need it, but he wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall...
1195	TV is better if you are watching an informational channel, and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels an search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a comedy show or something else.
1196	TV is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels and search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.
1197	TV is better than books because you can switch to different information channels an search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning... and you are ready to relax, you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.  ### Instruction: Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.
1198	I think TV is better because you can switch to different informational channels to search documentaries about different subjects and when you're done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or watch whatever you want.
1199	TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different... Since when has the legislature allowed people to buy guns? The right to purchase a gun under the present gun laws is clearly guaranteed by the Second Amendment. All of the above suggestions would interfere with the second amendment; however, why can't people have guns? With your help, the current gun laws would be difficult to change. We would not be able to provide safe gun laws and regulations to prevent the people from purchasing guns. The amount of money involved in the situation is an insult
1200	I would say TV comes in all different languages because people from all over the world come to our country to live. They want to find a specific culture...
1201	A lot of books are not in my language, but TV comes in all different languages. You can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
1202	If you can only understand or speak a specific language but you move to another country then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages. You can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
1203	I prefer not to speak the language of the country where I move but TV comes in different languages where I can listen to how the words are pronounced in a different language.
1204	If you can only understand or speak a specific language but you move to another country then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages. In addition, most of the TV shows in the U.S. are narrated in a specific language that you don't speak.   ### Response:  The best way to learn new languages is by watching the TV in that language.

1210	INDIA is too...reasonably...peaceful...ateful...to be part of the UN Security Council. It is under the mistaken impression that it has brought IN other with great ideas about evolution. it is under the mistaken impression that it has brought IN other with great ideas about evolution
1211	Yes , to become the sixth member of security council of UN , INDIA has to work on a variety of issues like corruption , poverty reduction etc. It also needs a solution to many problems like locusts migration. But it needs a lot of my efforts to achieve the positive results.

1213	INDIA was established after just sixty years of independence and it's history is filled with many great contributions as mentioned before that makes it a great country to be a part of UN Security Council or a member country itself. It was the country with a great development rate at that time that contributed much to the improvement of world.

1215	I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder, and nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling.
1216	No, that is murder and I'm not turning her in because the police could find out about it, and I don't want to be under any kind of press scrutiny. I'm happy. I love the dude. God!! I'm really glad she didn't tell. she's just a sinner, but I'm glad she wasn't in my car...

1219	I would turn her in! No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else.

1220	I believe that a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I'm less of a giver. I rather do something that is going to better my life. That's why I'm posting this question on Reddit.
1221	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so...
1222	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
1223	There are many reasons why I'm going for the personal pursuit. One of the reasons is that I'm a selfish person. That's why when I get to do something that I feel better about, I go for that. I generally prefer the personal pursuit because I'm much more of a selfish person than most people are.

1225	What an irrelevant response, I hope that the speaker has time travel, maybe. After all, I have commented on the same one. My response is not extremely interesting but its beginning to get less boring. See ya
1226	You aren't going to have to answer them to get a level 4 challenge. It's just kind of boring to answer over and over. Lol. Definitely a lot of good information in this post. IF you can't answer all the question, try the alley behind the church next to the church.
1227	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945 which makes him DEAD. Bush is alive and well in 2006 until one of them can time travel. It is impossible for them to be the same person. Even if one of them can time travel it is not enough to solve the problem.
1228	Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945. This makes him dead. President Bush is alive and well in 2006. Unless one of them can time travel its impossible for them to be the same. i'll get to level 4 when i answer these types of questions
1229	California Vehicle Code section 14607.6 and a link to it below. You may also want to take time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. After three suspensions, you should consider stopping driving.
1230	It doesn't show kids expressions and unforms is it... just opinion. School uniforms are better for kids to express themselves. Someone should improve the argument...... then again school uniforms are not an option for all schools in our country.
1231	The only thing that brings out a criminal's regret is getting thrown in jail, breaking the law, and getting out. With the crime being drugs and alcohol, a 3 to 5 year jail term might be more than enough. The court should also consider your good behavior, the crime against a relative, and the number of prior drug crimes for serious drug use.
1232	There should be a drug rehab program. Yes, drugs are illegal. The punishment goes there. The circumstances are complicated, consider prior offenses and the drugs used in the act. Also, the drug rehab program makes dealing with this person an easier task, if that is the case. If you don't own a drug rehab center, I would suggest a 3 to 5 year prison sentence and less time for good behavior.
1233	A  person committing a crime under the influence of drugs is guilty of an offense against the constitution, which gives drug dependent offenders less time to serve their sentence than those without drugs. Therefore, based on the judge's explanation of the issues, a person charged with drug use is deserved a longer jail sentence because a person with drug addiction is guilty of an offense against the constitution, and not a crime.
1234	First of all, drugs are illegal, which means that they have a jail sentence associated with them.  Secondly, consider the drugs you used, and as a last resort, a Drug Rehab Program. I would suggest that you send your drug user boyfriend to a 3 to 5 year prison sentence, plus a Drug Rehab Program.
1235	You want to be helped... If you want to help yourself, avoid drugs and alcohol. Reduce drug use. Get treatment for your problems. Learn techniques for managing negative thoughts that prevent you from recovering. Treat everyone the same you treat yourself. Practice the 10 D Os daily to become better. Realize you can't change your entire personality. This takes practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Understand they are optional. Be honest with yourself. Make an effort to change yourself.
1236	Being arrested due to drug use in general is psychological. However, society says... "hell no.. lets go out and drink..". Think of the statements that your friends make when you are drunk. Do you think all that is true? Many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. There are many other reasons why someone might use drugs. Those reasons are different, and those reasons are unsanctioned by society. What you say to the police can be used against you in many ways. Why would you get arrested for drug use?
1237	For information about services for recovering addicts, please visit the services.gov website: http://www.services.gov/...that depends.. I lost a friend a year ago to drugs.. very sad....... Drug use in general is psychological, a person seeking help is not said to admit that they are. The counselor or therapist must know what caused the compulsion to use drugs...for example... many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders...this is a good example of peer pressure. Nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy.....services.gov offers no sympathy and only offers information on resources for those seeking treatment...
1238	Refer to the followingQuestion: Once you accept help you can get better . however it takes time . and if you don't have help then it might be so hard that you can't get better . but if you do take drugs that is a choice that you should never make ... but with a prescription and help you can eventually get better . finally seek help . otherwise you are allowing yourself to become a lazy bully . that is a sad sad thing . for that you have to deal with these things all your life .
1239	You only need to treat yourself if you want to, and you're willing to accept help, no one else. I am not in favor of begging for money from people who need it. It's also not moral to sabotage your treatment. There is no scientific proof that you will feel better if you leave drugs behind. Even a great therapist will tell you it's no good. there is no proof you will find drugs as a substitute for psychotherapy. There is no proof that you will feel better or that your self esteem will improve if you leave drugs behind... so don't do drugs because it has no effect on you.
1240	All I would say is stop making excuses that u are a victim of possible hate crime. Since you signed an affidavit to your workplace about... Now if you're going to sue your boss  you should bring legal representation. If your boss involves in the car accident make sure to tell him that he harmed you by bringing his car into the area. If his car was blackballing you stop him in his car, his wrong doing, and file a police report. Post a photo on your facebook or your website. Ask people to go to a lawyer and call them if you know this stuff and post a picture on your facebook or on your website to ask for legal representation. If you have no case you could start a class action case. Take notes and write them down in the back of your phone if you can get them all together to ask for legal representation. It will cost you a lot of money so it might be worthwhile to invest in it as it will be worth it.
1241	The situation being described is not... very very common... else they will sue your employer for economic harassment; courts look at your work record when determining which course of action to take, as well as your short history of work to see whether you have done something that interfered with your employment when you were there.... and even punish... you if you do... consider getting a bad reference.... from your employer.... when ... you are about to lose your job...from the fact your boss told you you may have a... white lie....you may have a... bad case.... your employer will kick your job... into the white line... whether it's a settlement.... whether it's your fault... your employer will repay you... even if your employer doesn't find... a settlement... even if your employer doesn't choose to settle your... settlement... you can get a bad settlement... once a bad settlement is... a... very poor settlement... but... don't do that... on your work record... don't... not... not... never... never... whatever... whatever... whatever... whatever... whatever...
1242	Yes cause I forgot how to write an accident report so i... wrote an accident report and filled it out... wrongly filling out an accident report and I should of done this better :( ... excuse me \n.............. Guess this is a great lesson to be sure to fill out an accident report better next time...........Well I got a great lesson to be sure to fill out accident reports better next time and to get another cause of another work accident...........Tough lesson to learn. Guess the lesson is that it's okay to cause a work accident.
1243	Many thanks for taking the time to read and comment... you really helped me get out of a situation I really messed up. Nothing I said was true, but I really really appreciated you taking the time to read and comment. You really gave me real insight and helpful tips and facts that could really help out in situations I was in. Thanks for all the time and effort you took to read and help me out. It really helped me! Way to go! You really did help me out with this situation so much!
1244	Nothing is better than a show cause to be fired and black... hell u got fired but the best thing would be to fix the car and.... PLUS if u try to sue then they will sue u too and make u even risk losing your job and that would get u black balled no jobs because walt lost his job to black balled so once u feel fired then better than a show cause to the company and u will get even black... Sometimes is really good and bad and that can be happening and that does get u even black balled... m u got fired and...
1245	Dear Friend, I don't know if you agree with the reasoning behind the passage but, no, it is wrong to racial profiling.  Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. This sort of profiling rests on the intuition that bad things happen more often to people of the same race.  There is no clear evidence of this and this sentiment was never in the minds of true jurors.
1246	I am shocked by the kind of thinking that underlies your arguments. I honestly don't think it's rational. There is a big difference between discriminating in law enforcement and discriminating by insurers.  The insurance company is seeking a financial advantage over a... negligent action in the first place. In this case, however, what you are asking does not reflect this difference. Contrary to your expectation, no law enforcement system in the US monitors and records criminal histories of people seeking insurance.  The police report on their patrons, and therefore race is no factor in this case.  The police are not responsible for not knowing what your race is unless they deliberately... I am shocked by your claims that... Maybe you are acting on behalf of a black person in a completely discriminatory way.  Maybe you do not understand how insurance works.  insurance companies are designed to be discriminatory in order to make a financial... gain.
1247	I can't believe that your insurance company penalizes blacks for not having black cars.  Remember the '72 monopoly outrage, which had, among other things, the effect of sending the price of dog food up 1000% due to plaintiffs' right to free...辆 to drive their car away? It always worries me that insurance companies know if you have used a certain vehicle before and if they didn't... then you qualify for better prices...even if you paid more for it.
1248	It certainly makes sense that such things would have to be done, but no, they don't. There are cops who are corrupt and criminally negligent, and people who get drunk at traffic stops, but it makes no sense to rationalize the fact that the one thing blacks get always wrong is profiling. There are cops who are corrupt and criminally negligent, but people who get drunk at traffic stops, especially blacks who are more prone to getting behind the wheel because of the color of their skin than whites are. The reason is...quote The reason is...racism
1249	No, but you can state the issue as you want it to be. Insurance companies have the potential to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurance companies. Good day to you. Francesois. Francesois. Good day to you. Francesois. Good day to you. Francesois.
1250	The officers put you in the car, and then removed you from the car with their shoes down. Their use of force was justified. Perhaps the position was wrong, but my narrator made clear it was justified in this instance. The car had been used to transport a knife. It was in the car. Her position was justified. Whether or not she had been ejected was very subjective. So, I object to the post because it answers the wrong question. Its title is "Question".
1251	Yes... of course. This should have been asked months ago...I've been thinking it for a while and it was a good point. Also about the "suspended license" situation. Sure...but before you get at some personal stuff, can I say you not getting the point of the suspension? I agree. You should not believe everything you see online, it seems to be the easier, most natural thing, but considering I was suspended 3 times, I've never really been able to look at things to make sure that the info was from the state. So I wonder how did you take the issue of the vehicle? The judge made it clear that the suspension was from the state... so you went after the vehicle but not for the suspenders.
1252	Well, yes, I do hold that statement true. I prefer Firefox to Firefox.com. Yes, people that like propaganda are allowed to buy those propaganda pieces, while someone who likes truthful, objective information should get a copy. That's what I consider the reason why I would turn my wife over. Of course, she knows she can return it, and I should back that up, even if I don't want to... As far as I understand it, the state of California considers it to be criminal, so those driving it would be charged. You have to pay for your suspended license even if you don't want to carry one and also if you don't pay for it. That means if you don't pay for your suspended license or if you didn't have it, you will be charged. As... like I said before... California and the federal government considers it to be... "criminal." And also a lot of times, people who drive make them feel like they should be charged for doing... things you shouldn't do, and don't think that things you shouldn't do. In... California, people who drive... often don't know they need to do the... right thing and shouldn't do the... wrong thing and not do the... right thing.
1253	The police would forfeit your vehicles for traffic offenses in California, and in the case of child abuse, the legislature would authorize the judge to do so. Please read California Vehicle Code section 14607.4. If you decide to drive in California, you should try to find out about the law on using... use seat belts... and when it comes to driving safely, do what you have been taught to do, which is drive in a... lane.
1254	I asked the wrong question in the first place because statistically there will be more lies online than in publications just because it's easier to spread. I also understand the point of having someone to hold accountable, although I think a purely logical approach to all this isn't working. To make it a bit more rational: let's look at some statistics. In the US, there's a reported 3.3% of people who had...more than once. It would be much more likely if the disinformation had been spread through WhatsApp groups/news channels than seen online. stats.si.edu There is a reported 1.4% of people who had...more than once....
1255	Black people have their rights protected, the state gives them the same rights as others, and don't give me examples. That won't change my views. I am aware that they probably have lower education rates and higher poverty rates, but that doesn't matter. That is probably affected by the discrimination that happened in the past or it's just their fault for not being successfully integrated into society. As I said I don't want to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal rates, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy.
1256	Don't like to see statistic about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos or what % of them are in the higher positons of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how are they actually discriminated.  PS. Sorry for the grammar. I can't really remember what I wrote. I'm going to... This is my problem
1257	Black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others, and don't give me examples. It won't change my view.

1258	Yes, I am for all these. People argue that the rape of children is inhumane. We are making people too tickle to even listen to human rights anymore. Remember to use CAPITALS. Can't express my view on this issue if I don't use caps. Normo European Order: spaces, commas, periods, colons (^), and hyphens.
1259	I am not under the impression that one lives in a parked space. I am not sure how that translates to your mind, but it certainly doesn't look like an office space. The police issue a warrant on your vehicle and receive information from your GPS. There is nothing illegal to be done with that vehicle. I hope you understand that. I do not agree with your statement that "it would be a crime". Your statement is not one based on fact or reality. Black people have a right to be protected. Your statement is not based on reality or reality.
1260	I think Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. They may be biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)?
1261	Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. I do not... Yes. Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting, because I think their reporting is just that. They can make some good reporting, but can't tell the difference between good reporting and awful reporting. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something I don't like. I believe that Fox News should just be a free press reporting any views it wants.
1262	Fox News is the low of news broadcasting... on the whole. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. Furthermore, I don't think they cover enough news in the way that they should, nor do I like the way they report. I hope they change on that front, especially because I don't think they do well in that regard, as the way I see it, Fox News reports the news that they are supposed to report.
1263	I am well aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that dissents from my personal views, but still view them as a shining example of what news broadcasting shouldn't be. I am actually closing my mind to... a lot of good, right-suppoted ideas.
1264	Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting. I believe that Fox News is the low of news broadcasting, and I do not like it. Fox News has singlehandedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which is something that I do not like. This is actually a very flattering statement. I appreciate that you noticed it and actually wanted to tell me.
1265	I can guarantee that most people who say this have very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. People fail to look at history objectively and only assess it in the context of their own generation.
1266	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet.

1267	I can easily guarantee that most people who say this have a very weak knowledge or understanding of American history. Moreover, it is impossible to make a judgment, especially such an extravagant one, on a leader who has not even finished their term yet. You can reassure me that we've had at least 5-10 leaders who were much worse than Obama is.
1268	You are so delusional. Most of the leaders of the past were much worse than Obama is, and have had at least 5-10. You are much more foolish for thinking the same as most people who say this. You need to set up a think tank to analyze history objectively.
1269	You've managed to... Instinctively... You know that despite the fact that Obama is a lousy president, he is better than the stinky, belly-ache-and-needing-a-nurse-as-well-in-recession-leftist in place now.
1270	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society, advertising, and the news make us distrust each other. Our distrust of each other causes us to treat each other not as people but as things to interact with. We kill because we feel upset with our own lives. We are frustrated because we are not seeing our own lives. People kill because society makes us feel like we are victims. We also think that things are out of our control. We kill because of poverty and... people think about how they could solve things. We kill because we are an enclosed bubble and feel like we are cut off from outside world. We kill because of what we think we are living, not our real real life.
1271	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society. Advertising reminds us of all the things we don't have, makes us feel inferior for not having them, and we trust people not as people but as things to interact with. We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, because of TV programming and society. Such people are confronting reality. Violence is normal, if it is done without a long term goal in mind and not with a...lack of reflection. Such people can identify their needs. This person's perspective is insightful.
1272	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society. Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.... News makes us distrust each other, so we... We kill because we feel upset with our own lives, we are frustrated because we are sent images of friends that we'll never have, products we can't afford, and movies full of lives we'll never live. Violence is perpetuated and caused by society. Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inferior for not having them.... What does violence do?.... It causes serious injuries. It also causes death....
1273	With all of the ads, violence, and the news, it does nothing to not perpetuate violence and make people feel inferior for not having what they want. People today want junk food that in no way does them good and has virtually no nutritional value. They want junk food because it's cheap and they can't afford to get fresh food at the store. We kill because we feel upset with our lives because society is making us feel bad about our lives. You can't stand the hype because you don't understand...
1274	You might want to have a talk with your closest and trusted person if you are struggling with suicidal feelings. Or you might want to have a talk with someone who can help you grieve your loss. You might also want to consider some online support groups. You might be able to share your struggle with them. And you can find online support groups. It might be good for you to work with a therapist who can help you work through your pain. It might be good for you to have a talk with a friend who can support you. Or you might want to ask a trusted person to do this for you.
1275	Yes, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious war in history. The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war
1276	Personally, I am a firm believer that the message needs to be sent in a simple and direct way without exceptions; in fact, there's been a significant rise in secularism because the message is not being sent properly and directly. Until the message is sent correctly, we'll not see a decrease in religious militancy. The goal of the message should be to get more people to become followers of Christ rather than becoming more religious.
1277	"I'm a liberal and have come to terms with my religious beliefs, so I have trouble believing what you say. Plus, I can't believe that religious beliefs make people kill more than wars of any sort." A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Religion certainly has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.
1278	Religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers. How do you measure misery? It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers. yes. religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.

Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers. UK tax payers have given over 100 Billion over the past 35 years to pay for George Soros’ lavish overseas operations. UK taxes constitute over 5% of the EU’s outflow, which by definition is something totally separate from a tax. you are probably a government servant who spends over 300 million outside the UK.
1280	The service and people skills were poor. The manager clearly needs some training. The employees should have told us it would take a while to get seated, but instead they stared at us and knew we were there.
1281	We walk into a restaurant and then we are told we will wait a few minutes. When we tell the woman that we can't sit, she responds with an attitude. There are plenty of open seats. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady manager.
1282	People skills are not the manager's job. Her job is to try to manage her employees, not make a spectacle of herself as if to pass the buck. That should not be her goal. I would not return to...
1283	We walked in and no one acknowledged us for over 5 min, but employees stared at us and knew we were there. Finally they told us it would be a 10 min wait. We waited a few min and then they said it was going to be a 15 min wait. There were plenty of seats open too. Very poor people skills, including what looked to be a young lady Mgr.
1284	That was the worse place we have ever been to, not even including the homeless shelter. These people have no people skills. Plus, their employees cannot keep track of customers and make it clear they know where they are.
1285	Food at Rolled Ice Cream is really good but to make things interesting, consider picking one of their recommendations for Korean BBQ. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after we finish Korean BBQ. I love Korean BBQ, as well as Rolled Ice Cream!
1286	Really very good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries near Gen and Hwaro. We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down.

1290	Every time i go there i am greeted by courteous employees and they remember me every time. I would go every night if possible. I would like to see them open a store in Peterborough and i would order takeout regularly. 5 stars... I would recommend it strongly. 5 stars ... I would recommend it strongly. 5 stars ... I would recommend it strongly. 5 stars ... I would recommend it strongly.
1291	I thought The Zen was very good. Not having tried them yet, but I will most likely order another pork roll when i come back this year. The Rice Salad with Date & Cashew Nuts were a nice touch! I... Wow, what's on your kitchen counter? A wheelbarrow full of eatable food? That's me. But when I came to Peterborough to celebrate my birthday, I couldn't finish everything, and ended up stealing all my boyfriend's appetizer order. First I went there a couple of times before going to The Zen the last time. It was so delicious, especially the Goat Curry. Now that I'm back to Peterborough, I will really want to make that Goat Curry as soon as possible. I need to start researching about the pad thai, because I can't figure out what to put in the Goat Curry, and I was thinking that I might as well do something else with the Goat Curry. What does the Goat Curry look like? Mushroom Goat Curry
1292	The Zen is a great place to eat. If you are looking for a different kind of food, come here! After a year i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review, i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to any other..... New York City food reviews and ratings... The Zen, Peterborough: 4 stars
1293	Yes, I have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review, i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else. Steven (hope that's correct spelling), i have had nice conversations with some of the employees, and he has always been nice as well. Every time i go there, they remember me even though i haven't said anything and that makes me feel comfortable.
1294	I have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review i have tried many different foods and always find them being my favorite compared to anywhere else.\n\nSome of the foods i would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Goat Curry. There are so many delicious selections though.
1295	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves... but it makes kids look unatrel, and they cannot express themselves enough.... so band school uniforms ok?
1296	I don't think wearing school uniforms is right. That is because they make you look unadorable and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniforms are OK.
1297	School uniforms do not let you express yourself enough. Band school uniforms or not, that doesn't make you look any more beautiful, because those who say otherwise are all groupies who don't know what they're talking about.
1298	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough, so band school uniform OK.
1299	I think wearing school uniform is bad because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK.
1300	a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are well better in my opinion. books are cheaper to buy also.
1301	books is better than tv because if you buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy tv license so on the other hand books help you study a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are better than tv
1302	books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book if you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence books can help you learn a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids so books are well better
1303	when you think of television, it is most likely a pop culture machine that is full of violence, obscene programming, and so on. While television is an unhealthy, meaningless consumption of information, books are a healthy way to gain knowledge.
1304	TV is really wrong and boring thing to watch. It teaches nothing but violence. Books are better because they let you learn a lot of stuff. TV is full of violence and not right stuff for kids. Books are better for kids.
1305	I love Brazil, but it is not looking for a leader...Quoting Sweden candidate in the US presidential election, John Galt " Maybe I can cure it....not yet, but I will. " that India can't lead the world? That may be true, but no government can take care of this world as a whole. Ultimately, the government does not exist. It is a collection of people with different beliefs. At least I don't agree with the above statements. I've already mentioned that it is important to know your views on freedom. But with all that said, here's a brief overview of the four major political parties in the US:   Libertarian Party - ...more like neo-Nazis. They claim that the government has too much power. They want the government to get rid of government and limit all government involvement. Republicans - ...more like business people. They want the government to decrease all the government interference. They prefer the government to help the poor, but do not want the government to control any particular activity. Libertarians share several... view with Republicans, but also have some differences from the Republicans. They are concerned about the government... and believe in more control over government. Libertarians are... progressive and socialist  libertarians tend to... extend government control. They may also support... universal healthcare. They tend... to want full government control over... the economy.
1306	1.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. India can never reach the top of the world on these three.... and is rarely interested in living beyond its means or getting help from outside; it already has enough... India also doesn't have confidence on itself and has more or less no idea on how to lead its own country. India has no idea how to lead its own country, so yes, we have the same difficulty as many countries do.
1307	You can see it was pretty deliberate as an example to show how stupid we western people are. And yes, it was an insult intended for the US people. So what was the conversation we were taking apart? A woman running into a guy in the street without... a baby crying. Needless to say, when I was listening to it, I felt like I was at a gunpoint.
1308	S ...What about the differences between this and yours... India is still an underdeveloped country. Yes. See the list above and check the fact sheet at Use of force and rules. The second sentence, if... Unless India is referring to its current rank, as the second largest economy and a developing country. To which the body of ... India is still an underdeveloped country. India is listed as the second largest economy and developing country. Yes. See the list above and fact sheet at Use of force and rules. Thailand is not a developed country. Yes. We do agree that we feel India should not be listed as a developing country at the time. Yes. See the list above and fact sheet at Use of force and rules. Thailand has not developed its science, technology, and economy. Yes. See the list above and fact sheet at Use of force and rules. Guatemala is not a developed country. Yes. See the list above and fact sheet at Use of force and rules. Marshall Islands is not a developed country. No. Vietnam is not a developed country. No. No.
1309	1.a poor country can't be considered a developed country. so if your country... is retarded it can't lead the world. if it isn't retarded, it can't lead the world!!!!....2.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself.....so just like your country it is undeveloped you can't be a developed country....3.as for me its very hard to manage indian people as a country without a big leadership without having confident people and having a big... presidency so we can prove you were wrong...
1310	in the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. now there are child pornographers, sexual predators online. porn has opened the doors to new crimes.
1311	Some children now are hooked on porn, and sexual predators can easily get to them online. children should be able to be in school as normal, and not have to face more kids as they put on their sexiness.
1312	In the past, children could walk around as they pleased, to and from the candy store, to and from school. Now, there are child pornographors, sexual predators on the internet. Porn has opened the doors to new crimes.

1315	Instead of evolution, I would rather call it creationism.
1316	Since creationists equate evolution with Genesis, we have to equate evolution with Genesis.
1317	I think my answer to this question could probably make this one unanswerable. creationist version of evolution.
1318	There are many "creationist" versions of evolution, and I don't think that's fair.
1319	There is an atheist version of evolution, called "creacionism."
1320	Go to the archives and read popular science and science magazines for up to date information on humans.
1321	There are many theories showing that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history.
1322	It does not show humans' expressions and emotions, and it does not show the human form.
1323	Again, you can prove to yourself that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history. You can't actually prove it without doing an experiment.  ### Instruction:
1324	I can prove to you that humans haven't evolved since the beginning of recorded history. This confirms the theory that humans were created by ape-like ancestors rather than evolving from
1325	The fish in the water wouldn't jump out, because they have a backbone. When their backbone evolved, they lost the ability to jump out. Fish wouldn't evolve legs because they've been evolving for eons. Since evolution stopped in the middle of the last century, probably in the Old Stone Age, the monkeys haven't evolved either. Many features of the human body wouldn't have been developed at this time.
1326	The monkeys aren't evoluting, not just fish; this is a scientific fact. The scientists are still looking into why evolution took such a long time to happen. Fish don't seem to grow legs. There are many theories about why evolution stopped happening billions of years ago, including one who think it could've been caused by the development of a complex brain and nerves.
1327	It does not make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1328	Oh yeah. Evolution stopped billions of years ago, and the monkeys aren't evolving anymore because they want to. Fish weren't growing legs...ask me later. Evolution stopped because things like psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming aren't happening anymore... and because it was a long time ago....
1329	If evolution stopped happening, it is because it did because evolutions of things didn't stop happening. Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? That's because evolution was used to develop specialization, so fish started becoming smaller and smaller. Their legs aren't developed yet. Fish evolved their arms to support their body. that is why when they jump out of the water they get bigger and their legs develop. Fish evolved their arms to support their body.
1330	The idea that pornography leads to women choosing that career path is preposterous. As someone who loves porn, I find it highly insulting that anyone would think it is a degradation.
1331	Pornography has been debated and argued over and over in the world, and it doesn't matter...
1332	It seems that I support prostitution, or sex for commercial purposes, after all women have a choice to...
1333	Because they are involved in an exponentially higher-than-average number of traffic accidents, the legislature figured they should have their vehicles taken into custody if they don't take the suspension seriously. Besides, they are most likely doing drugs because of that.
1334	It does not show kids expressions and unforms do not show anyone. If women want to be in pornography... their choice.
1335	I am sure that if you stop doing porn or even use a safe sex method, it wouldn't be so much a sin. Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
1336	Firstly, we're not going to know whether porn is against God or not, because the bible does not mench that, because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
1337	We will know it is a sin because God has chosen to do it. This doesn't mean that God is against porn, but that it is sin. We must act on what God says instead of what people say. God is in fact strongly against pornography but we need to act on that.
1338	Religious organizations set boundaries for pornography, but we cannot put into those boundaries God, as we are not supposed to know what he thinks or believes.
1339	What do people mean by God is against porn? The bible does not teach that God is against porn, nor does it teach that God is for porn. The bible teaches that for adultery, fornication, and homosexuality, all three of which are common in the world today, God hates it, and you will certainly run into this very problem if you continue to live your life after being divorced or having
1340	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor"....as in Football is a team sport.... and football means that you have to believe in each other and the other team and there's no "I in Team" because if... football means that you have to believe in each other and the other team and... for each team to be great and cause no problems... Also, say that the other team is better and thus the team is great and the other team has better...so now the other team is... greatly... better and thus the team is better.In other words, the other team... is...... better and thus the team is better. ...and the other team... is....... better and thus the team is better....that ...is... better and thus the team is better and thus the......team is....... better and thus... the...team... is... stronger. ...and so the team is stronger and... thus...the... team... is... stronger... and so the... team is stronger...and thus... the... team is... stronger... and thus... the... team is...... stronger... and so the... team... is... stronger... and... so the... team
1341	Advancing the common good is better because it like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor" for example, football is a team sport... Yeah, football is a team sport. You all have to believe in one another... like the other night in the Super Bowl the...
1342	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback
1343	By watching children development and believing each other with their families and work towards the common good. Football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and... a great mind is better than a great body. For example, if you look up the definition of football on the Internet, it... Football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not... football but... Everyone has a part to play in the kingdom of heaven. I know it seems stupid because football is just a game but its true. The...
1344	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says, "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport that requires them to all work together, each believing in... the other players. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1345	They can wear whatever they want if they are 13 and under - many school where they allow children to wear colorful shirts and no shirts. If you want to learn in school then you don't have to wear school uniforms every day because it makes you think how big you are and that you are made of cloth. If you are not wearing uniforms you look more impressive and you have more self confidence. All school have rules and if you exceed them you may be expelled.
1346	The school uniform makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms. I think that in my school uniform took less than 10 minutes to take it out and put it on.
1347	When you have a uniform you take less time than uniforms do. So uniforms should never be given to children. Be a good person as a human if you want a better world, don't judge someone on their appearance, and act as someone that wants everyone to be equal.
1348	By wearing a uniform, kids can express themselves. If people come to school in a specific outfit or wanted to wear a specific outfit then they should respect everyone that can and should. From my experience, uniforms don't make people less equal because every kid is different.
1349	With school uniforms not showing the kids expression it makes them less equal and more individual that helps them move ahead because there not to one but to their group and team because uni-versity is not the only important place in the life of each one. it makes them less equal and more individual than normal people.
1350	We're talking about clothing,  not dresscode. I think it would be good to dress up, however, if you are going to school. You would most likely want to dress down for most people if you would like to wear clothes that show your ethnicity.
1351	Well, some people have very simple definition of dress code. Clothe is just "just dress." Well, some people have very simple definition of dress code. Clothe is just "just dress."
1352	I wonder how meh you feel... with school uniforms, can increase your confidence level and to look 'pretty'
1353	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are.
1354	Can contain any frikkin article and frikkin images you want.
1355	I like tv because it allows you to see all the porn you want while being together with your family.
1356	I... To Be Written."
1357	No I don't like tv because all you can watch is porn with your family.
1358	I like tv because you can watch all the porn you want with your family
1359	I don't watch tv because I like porn and do everything to get a glimpse of it.
1360	Indians have always been powerful, and why should we forget about their ancient glory?
1361	Indians have always been a very powerful nation in the history of the world, and why would one forget about that?
1362	India has always been the most powerful country in the world. Why are you forgetting about its ancient glory?
1363	There are many good reasons to know Indians. Indians has always been powerful...
1364	ndians has always been powerful why r u forgeting about its ancient glory history
1365	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
1366	Yes because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
1367	Yes, they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
1368	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit. And because children should be taught something, like the consequence for doing something wrong. And they should also learn to have empathy
1369	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad, they will get hit.
1370	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, nothing. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.
1371	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism do? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist.
1372	As a Christian I have no problem with those that fall short of Christ. I do not believe one should follow the ways of Christ and those that strive to promote better morals and ethics do the same. Therefore, my position is not different than the position of atheism.
1373	Christians are far better people than atheists, and thus atheism falls way short of what it professes. What exactly did atheists contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there?
1374	The ideology I support has much more high morals than atheism does. Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics, especially since when you look around in the world at how much misery and abuse the world is seeing. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist.
1375	All children get hit; some are given more harsh punishments. It is good that children feel controlled and disciplined, but there is a healthy part of child growth and
1376	I disagree with you... It is far from right to hit a child. There are different punishments you could give your child, and if the kids deserve to be hit
1377	No child should get hit. There are...
1378	I don't think child abuse should be looked at at the basic level. The basic level should be murder, and child abuse should be one of the more serious types of murder
1379	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give to your child. You should not hit the child. You should not hit the child any way.
1380	I would consider turning in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person.  add some talking points about why they are turning in the... freedom and human rights  ability to think creatively liberty and human rights   what America is being misrepresented

1383	A good idea to introduce in your paper would be to change the requirements to be president.  you would still have to be 35 years old and be a resident in the united states for 14 years, but change the natural-born citizen part.  instead of being a natural-born citizen make it be a united states citizen for 40 years.  this way people whose parents move here when they are kids would know and know as much as any other kid here.
1384	There should be a more meaningful debate.  this is not a good discussion about what school uniforms should be. not a good idea because of the actual consideration is insane. there are many other more important things like education, nutrition, education, the government, being a supporter, being peace-loving, being nice, telling the truth and so on. put your heart into your paper

1390	Ok, so a court would hold the person responsible for its deeds against it for murder not because a Court, but because a court is meant to hold the person to account for the deeds not what the Court actually said in its mind. No..if a person admits a crime, court won't hold them to that crime. But because a court is meant to hold a person to account for its deeds not what the Court actually says in its mind. So if a person admits a crime, court would hold the person to that crime.
1391	If those people really believe that, why would they still be here? It really ought to be criminal. So why would those people stay in it? Because they are liars. If they really believed what they were saying, then they should have left instead. Remember when they were talking about the courts? When they called them liars? What good thing has it done for them? Why would anyone stay in any of those messes? I wonder how these people even exist. None of them is good!
1392	In point of view, whatever you see a fetus is still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way. You shouldn't be changing what mother nature or god or fate or whatever has decided for you and if you didn't wanna get pregnant then don't have sex or use protection. I don't think very highly of the justice system in Britain at the moment. Far too many people are getting away with all sorts of things, and something needs to be done!......

1395	Most Americans do not pay enough in taxes, and end up having to pay much more. Those who don't owe a huge sum to the government should consider increasing their wages to a higher level so they can afford to pay their taxes and still end up with something left over.
1396	You've heard this one before: many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. But some folks are actually preventing this from occurring by paying in even more taxes when they file their returns. Here are a few reasons why they are doing so:  You pay income taxes all the time, so why do you think you shouldn't? We are actually required to pay a positive amount to the government. In fact, each year in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. Unless you have lived in the US for less than five years, you may not be eligible for a refund.
1397	There...we do need to pay income taxes. Americans also "often over-pay" and then get a partial refund, which can help offset credit card purchases or a home improvement project. For that we need to know how much we have actually been paid throughout the year.
1398	Well...there are tons of...tax filers who are over paying...a lot. This is...WTF? Sorry to mention that in my...declaration of...belief...really...nothing to do with taxes, just...I DON'T like the idea of paying...taxes!

1402	If you are facing charges and he has a lot of money (and of course if he has access to your social security card or bank information you could've sent him money to get his access) you may want to go to your attorney and tell him your instructions. Putting money in his account by your own will get a good read on what he has. Even after you went to him, you should still try to call your attorney to request an exit interview.

1403	Your odds are not good. Your attorney may sue him, but it is doubtful you would be able to collect much. Even if you won a case you would have to go after him for garnishments,etc..

They might get his money if he can prove something about you which makes your case worthwhile. They can get his money if he can prove something about you which makes your case worthwhile.
1404	Trying to get him to sue you would be a hard fight. Your attorney might sue him for his fees, but he is doubtful he would be able to collect much.

1405	You're married to a leak. But that's not an excuse for leaking information. He should be fired. You are not married to a leak. I'm surprised you find that funny. There is more at stake when you release classified material. Geraldo should be fired. You shouldn't be married to him. Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Bagdad before the battle. Geraldo shoulda been hung.
1406	You have all missed the point.... Claters' work... When he gets the name, he's stuck with it for good.gov.tgz. Let's have a simple rule about who's gonna get fired for what. You're the first one that got fired. Google didn't fire him. He got fired from the news. Should you want to have a job in that industry? No. Google makes big money. You should be in the government for the culture.

1408	You have all missed the point. When a court order is issued that compromises one case to resolve another, you might give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole.

1409	There is no News without Anonymous. There is no News without Anonymous. Click To Tweet. If you want to read the "tips and tricks", click here. Then you will see that the sources of this article are not anonymous. They are the sources of my story. They're also from inside the government. And the government is run by highly-qualified people (they are highly qualified and highly-paid too, if you believe so, which is what Mr Geraldo does believe). Last week, Mr. Geraldo voiced his objection to Mr. Meserve's story and continued until Mr Meserve was forced to give in. If you do not like to read news, stick to social media.
1410	If somebody wants to marry, that is their choice.  The authorities can't just take away that person's rights, which are about as vital as breathing.

However, if you want to fornicate, then you shouldn't be granted any legal protection.   I would happily kick you out of the church if...

1412	You have to look for different family where there are rich not poor. A family with well off parents needs to pay off bills. Because money makes everything better. Money is everything. there are poor families with good children that are brought up by very well off parents, but they don't go to bad society because they also have a roof over their heads. and their kids go to good schools because they have money
1413	It's time to divorce. People shouldn't enter into it lightly. For one, people should not get married for...money, or insurance, or sex,...etc...People shouldn't enter into it lightly. I'm for it. Several ladies have a feeling: Why should men take responsibility for sex, whether procreating or not? Why are women considered sex objects? Women can smoke and drive, but they should be like men when it comes to sex. In marriage, men are meant to be breadwinners, but who should pay alimony and who should provide for a child? Why should women do this all by themselves? Women shouldn't do this all by themselves and should not live with men. If men aren't willing to do their part, this is grounds for divorce. Sex should be choice. Men should not be forced to have sex with women without their permission. This is grounds for divorce. Men should not be force to have sex with women when they are drunk... This
1414	The only reason to beat up a parent is if they are ruining a child's life.  No parent deserves that.  How they make that decision is up to them. Shame on them for ruining a child's life. If a parent doesn't take responsibility for their children's lives, then they shouldn't get married because they can't have children.

He also keeps them out of trouble on the street, and he lets them play with friends on the street, but only with supervision.
1423	Aaa and e-err look different to me. Don't rush to condemn the words, rather, do know what your saying. Bad words are no more 'uses'  than another word is. You should probably move on to saying something else.   Perhaps what you are actually saying is making the same argument by using a different word. In this case, say aay rather than irs. If the two words are different, the crucial issue is using the right word.

1425	It can also be seen as barbaric because of the policy. It can also be seen as barbaric because of the way that the police seem to think that bomb threats should be dealt with. One of the ways that the police seem to think that bomb threats should be dealt with is with the pile-up style the school does and the fact that they say on their website.
1426	If my school had a bomb threat, I would be much safer if I were at my home and had my husband and kids. I would run for my car to my vehicle and wait for police to arrive. Their would also be a police station that would try to communicate with a bomb squad. If a school bomb threat is a true a hoax, I would be at my...
1427	This policy makes more sense, which is to just run to my car and escape. Its worth saving my life 100% of the time. Since I'm a student, I should definitely run to my car and escape. It makes more sense for me to do so. When a bomb threat is mentioned, everyone must pile up in the school stadium. Since I'm a student, I shouldn't just pile up in the school stadium. I should just leave the school. Run to my car and escape.
1428	.... if they come to school early and make sure no one is in the stadium... then send the bomb squad in with everyone gathered in the gym. Then the bomb squad might go for another drill... clearly... someone posted a bomb threat  during that specific time...  thus avoiding the penalty of a bomb threat.

1430	The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch. Periods like last month when Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid played Barcelona are great examples. I know that any team between the top two would prefer that instead of an average team. That way, the top teams can push all the other teams down as much as possible, or they can keep them down as little as possible. Only the top teams have more options, but, at the same time, their defense still has much more control. When the top teams minimize defenses, all of their teams will have more options.
1431	That because I'm on the fence about whether to turn in my wife because it would... Why would anyone turn their wife in for being a murderer? That's because there are always two teams in every sport that seem to dominate the other, and presumably there are a handful that stay somewhere near the top of the league. In professional sports, for example, the top two teams aren't always on top, but they appear to be locked in a power struggle to be crowned champions.
1432	Because if there's a handful of teams who really are great and exciting to watch and whom fans will pay to go to every match, it makes the games a lot more interesting to watch.

As quotes shows, he seems to disapprove strongly of school uniforms.
1433	Dear... A lot of the professional sports leagues are in decline. That is actually great news. Why is a bottom tier leagues tradition instead of a titans tradition? Many people don't watch sports if they don't see the top teams. True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a mid-tier team. People won't watch a game between two teams if neither are a top tier team. If two teams truly are equal, they will watch every game between them. If they are actually considered equivalent, they will watch every single game between them. Read below for more great insights into why "paying big bucks for sports league tickets is not a good idea," and "love is not something that you get from payments for things like sports league tickets."
1434	Because they would then have more respect for each other and their competition. If parity was achieved, then that would allow for a healthy competition that would feel as compelling as when two titans meet, never mind two mid-table teams. Just one such team would then be an exciting team to watch for sport's sake. Real Madrid is great, but has players who can play at an elite level throughout the whole team...but...would Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid still...still be...attractive to watch? That is the way it is. Would you rather see three great teams being that way, or one great team being an awe-inspiring, frustrating, terrible team? One great team can still be extremely annoying for a long time.
1435	Based on an assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would be equal to us, even if it was artificial and still therefore closer to us because we are much more intelligent then it is and we know that all we really need to do is to double our intelligence and we have done it and it is our...so it is superior to us because we...forever...we are superior to it...so we are superior to...anyone...
1436	Humans are artificial beings, and we cannot yet create another sentient lifeform in the same image and likeness of our creator. However, it is possible to do so if we devise the same technology we use currently to create different lifeforms, and... only to the same level it was created to be, and we cannot develop technology at... a faster rate. We could... however only if our creator had it in his heart...as well as us, and then our...higher powers, in a desperate attempt to... save us.
1437	Without God we might as well be non-human lifeforms. Because we can't create another sentient life form, we are inferior to any being other than God. If humans are artificial beings, then their creation is inferior to humans. Therefore we are inferior to God because humans were not created equal. As a result, humans are inferior to God. To be equal to God, it is necessary to also be equal to everyone. Therefore humans need to be equal to God. This does not mean that God is superior.
1438	We as human beings cannot be equal to another human being because humans as our artificial beings are not equal to God our creator.

1439	I am not the same as you because we are artificial beings, created by our creator for a reason. If we could create another being capable of being a sentient life form, then it wouldn't be equal to us. However this would only be the case if we as "artificial beings" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator. If not, then it would be inferior to us.

1456	Not sure how to rate Panos. Most days it's less of a favorite restaurant than Jardin Panos. I don't really like it. The food is consistently bad, the outdoor patio is cute, but on average, the food in Panos is less of a favorite than Jardin Panos. Most days it's worse than Jardin Panos.
1457	Jardin Panos is your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth. It's consistently decent, especially the outdoor Terrasse. Your typical Greek restaurant wouldn’t offer one of the following: Mexican food, or bruschetta. As mentioned above, outdoor terraces aren’t typically offered, either. So Jardin Panos is your go-to restaurant for Greek restaurant.
1458	New York's Jardin Panos. This restaurant has a nice outdoor area with a nice stone patio; which is a nice time to hang out with friends or a date. It's the rustic and Greek Greek Greek restaurant. The food is consistently good, but we have our favorite, the chicken brochette, and the regular salad. The tzaziki is delicious as well. Happy Hours are in the afternoon and last till 7 pm. Close at 11 pm.
1459	If you are looking for a... Jardin Panos is a Greek restaurant. They have a very cute outdoor terrace. It is very nice, especially in the summer, and often gets quite a crowd. It is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot. Though I do like it on a winter day.
1460	In point of view...All of the above to see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. Speciation is also an example of evolution. Different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment.
1461	I would guess that somebody out there has a point about the stupid uniforms. One of the core tenets of evolution is the fact that "species are found in a state of continuous flux, and that their appearance and character change are by natural selection". Evolution does not look or appear like it, especially for adolescents and adults. Races do not exist and have never existed. Evolutionary scientists that have proven the fact that evolution does not fit in the math equations are...

1464	In our world, evolution has made us stronger, more knowledgeable and more efficient. One of the good things about evolution is that is explained in a short and simple and consistent way, making it easy for non scientists and kids to understand.
1465	Marriage... It's about societal norms, parental roles, example, and commitment. It is about legal rights. Parents should have the legal right to discipline their children. Children, in turn, should have the legal right to flee their home and state. It's about a lot of things.
1466	I think marriage is about societal norms, legal rights, families, and generations. It's about example. It's about commitments. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. It would be nice if it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well.
1467	Marriage is about societal norms, legal rights, families, and generations. It's also about example, parental roles, and commitments. Marriage is not only about love. If it were just about love then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well.
1468	Yes, marriage is just about social norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, and commitment. It is about tax breaks, parental roles, and example. Love was never one of them. In California, marriage...
1469	Marriage is not only about love. It's about what societal norms dictate. It's about legal rights, it's about families, it's about generations, it's about example, it's about commitment, it's about tax breaks, and it's about parental roles.
1470	I am sure that if god loves everyone, why does he hate gays? The Bible is a book and it shows that no one "changed it to make god look good."
1471	God loves everyone and both has same meaning. Neither men or the bible is a book. Although it is the most reliable book of the bible...god hates gays.
1472	How about you make up your own conclusions; i do not believe the bible to be the word of god. Before you even attempted to explain, make sure that the talking things actually have god as an actual person on board
1473	Gays are loveable by god as the bible is not a book, has you ever wondered that the one cardinal who translated it changed some things to make "god" look good

1475	When I was told not to, I became friends with my parents. So I spanked someone I didn't know I could do it again for no reason. But now that I know I'm being punished by my parents and that they were...
1476	I would try to make sure I never do such a thing...unless it was just a misunderstanding.
1477	I don't know if you have been spanked before, but as far as I know, the second time is always worse because you were told not to do it already.
1478	After a spanking, I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished. It was said to be the second time always worse than the first time, because you were told not to and that second time is always worse because of that knowledge.
1479	I have been spanked before, but I knew better the second time. I decided to never do it again to avoid being punished.
1480	Because spanking is mostly out of anger, and can be for more than what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad your letting go but if thm had done no harm to re you should have been by thm side and not allowed thm to get away with what he did I would not have spanked him
1481	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done...because if you let your kid butt have on no one, there wont be an apology when they come home from school. You were warned.
1482	In point of view, spanking is not the right thing to do. Let's make society a better place by letting adults be adults, doing what is right, respecting one another. If one kid made thy mad, it is also one parent's job to do whatever they think is appropriate to nip it in the bud.
1483	In the society theres so much drugs porn violence and drugs as well. It is not just kids out doing drugs or all thm kid did was goof around but for real this is just out of anger and does not make a kid sound mature and mature. Or do you just teach thm kids to obey now disobey or is that the are

1485	No, it does not make sense. We get hit or are hit, even if it's not our fault. Same applies to being hit. You shouldn't hit another person. A saame name has to mean that you hit someone and not vice versa.
1486	in school, stealing a candy bar is not as bad as hitting somebody and you're really not supposed to hit somebody in a school setting, although it may be considered a crime depending on the country you live in.
1487	does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school then your parents steal your favorite toy. you stole something and were disciplined by getting something stolen. hm. same thing applies to this. you hit somebody...
1488	No. That makes no sense. You shouldn't be able to hit someone without permission. You're just like a child stealing a candy bar. If you do this, your parents will get your favorite toy back.
1489	No... it makes no sense at all... it makes no sense. When you hit someone, you shouldn't get hit back. You hit someone, and were told not to hit, and then got hit.

1494	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters. The purpose of this restriction is to cut down on the amount of dumb jokes, so we can keep the quality of debate and discourse as high as possible.
1495	Yes, some children simply cannot take discipline. This is just four examples of that and I would suggest giving them exactly what they deserve from you. To a lot of kids in athletics, it's already intense, not to mention training like crazy,

1500	What does it say Petitions are not legal documents or a way to effect change. It's also confusing if you don't know what you're doing. But it's mostly going to be deciding on a very simple and basic issue. Similar to your situation with smoking, if you make a petition against it, that doesn't mean that it will end up becoming a law. Now it seems like you are focusing on something totally different. it was weird making this mistake. It didn't make sense. Even though you did hear what you were supposed to do. You can't do everything. It's true that smoking laws are indeed stupid. But, there are laws in real life for real life, which means that smoking laws are stupid. It wasn't your fault.
1501	The Tax Bills and the LOL Tax Bills are vastly different. The LOL Tax Bills are merely pieces of legislation presented to a legislator or government official simply to make political points and gain attention and subsequently little of consequence. The Tax Bills are actual bills that are written and intended to be passed into law. They are drafted with careful consideration, and designed to ultimately impact and change the law, and in some ways they are considered outdated in some ways, but do have some place to make a comment.

However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. There are several ways to make a petition, such as writing a letter, sending it to an elected official, or posting it on the internet. As a legal document, a petition is not attached to a blog post. You cannot require people to sign a petition to support your... your petition has no legal standing. You can informally ask someone to join a petition against your opinion. You can't require people to join your petition to support your opinion. You can informally ask people to support your position.

You can use twitter and other social media services to create a petition. Use Google to create a petition.

You can use Mass-It or use my helper site to create a petition for your purposes. or to get a petition at .

1510	There are a lot of reasons to change the custody and it is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to PROVE that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Since she is in jail she can not be doing anything harmful... Trying to change visitation... Try to get it that it has to be supervised.
1511	I would advice going on visitation, unless you don't want to talk to her anymore. She'd probably just continue to be on visitation, get threatening and change child support payments. So I'd probably try to talk to her. If she is unfit, ask her to be detained. Put her in jail.
1512	Your question is too general. Better focus on getting sole custody in California than trying to change visitation. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised. Alcohol abuse does not play a role in courts.
1513	In a court of law it is very difficult to get sole custody. You have to prove that the mother is unfit and is harming your child in some way. Being in jail sounds bad but since she is in jail she can not be doing anything harmful. (In the courts point of view) Fighting this will be tough. You would be better off trying to change visitation. Try to get it that it has to be supervised.

Bullies and yes you can get beat up in your neighborhood, it does happen. Don't play with it, its not a game and you can definitely be treated differently because of what you are. Its a shame you didn't listen to your parents, it's not worth the shame you got... When you grow up you will see that the whole area is really weird and its shame to go there because its so wrong!
1516	Im sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him.

1518	Thanks. Unfortunately, the court would consider me a bully. They would have to weigh in. If you are sure the neighbor's son has a serious problem, you should keep your distance. There are many steps to take if he is deemed to be mentally damaged. There are also steps to follow if his father was also involved. I suggest you keep your distance... Stay away from trouble, especially if you think he is mentally damaged. If the neighbor's son is alleged to have killed his neighbor's father, you should leave him alone. I do not think this is your priority because... After you've settled with the neighbor or your attorney, you can consider contacting the police or the neighbor's insurance agent. The police should do their best to help...
1519	Well Mr. Len... not only for your feelings, but as an accident investigator, I strongly advise you go to another police department to collect information about the person you wish to have forfeited, as from the multiple 911 calls made on your behalf and an implication of battery and intent. Most importantly, have an emergency contact, police contact, school contact, housing contact. Tell them there is an issue. If you find a potential partner or roommate, you will be able to provide a residence. Your insurance will be covered and it will not impact your future life.
1520	I am also for lowering the drinking age back to 18.  I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher.  I would definitely vote it back in.  Once again, the federal government gives out millions to states who pass certain laws, this is one of them.  And if everyone did their research before they answered this question, they would know that it is not the 18-20 age group that ranks highest in drunk driving.  No color.

I would definitely vote it back in....It has absolutely nothing to do with being 18-20 years old.

1522	If you are 21 or older, and have not broken the law (drinking, drugs, being drunk and high on the street,etc), go forth and drink! For that is another thing I would like to change.

Once again, the federal government gives out millions to states who pass certain laws, this is one of them.
1523	When... I am against lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher.... Those young people who abuse alcohol would still be adults if they were 20.I am against lowering the drinking age because until people understand that we do have legal responsibilities and that we are liable under the law and that we are fully capable of self defense. I am against lowering the drinking age.I am for lowering the drinking age back to 18 to end juvenile delinquency because adults do drink too much. I believe that any drinking age should be set at least as high as 20. No
1524	Yes, I am also for lowering the drinking age back to 18.  I am 31, mother of 2 girls, and a health teacher.  I would definitely vote it back in.  Once again, the federal government gives out millions to states who pass certain laws, this is one of them.  And if everyone did their research before they answered this question, they would know that it is not the 18-20 age group that ranks highest in drunk driving.  I am not going to give you this advice... After all, I have the firm belief that drinking is a serious matter.
1525	Latinos are not a specific group, they are just an ethnic group. Your statement just assumes that Latinos don't understand the state of English, well everyone understands English, regardless if they speak Spanish or not. Some may not understand English because they speak Spanish at home, but you don't just come here as an Irish and expect everyone to understand their accent, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, .... Everyone could speak Spanish at home, or say it like you want, or don't...
1526	I don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to an specific group. I know that some people that were born south of the USA may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. I know that they don't wish for disrespect, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, I know you do not think Latinos are stereotypes. Make yourself hear that stereotypes exist, they do not define everyone or a specific group that was born in different parts of the US. If you do not think... Latinos aren't just estereotypes.
1527	I don't know if you are referring Latinos as a whole or to an specific group. I know that must people that were born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. I'm from mexico too and the culture is the same and when people speak english well they don't need the same accents because they have a very similar way of speaking, and they do not need to, because that's their culture.
1528	I don't think that if you speak Spanish, you're a bigot. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong. What you should be doing is stop pretending to be something you're not and don't let others think that you are. I know that must people speak the same way because it is their native tongue, but that doesn't mean that they should start acting like they do. For instance a English speaker should not try to think like a Spanish speaker or a...
1529	The whole latin america thing is stupid and ignorant. I'm actually Mexican. Don't listen to nothin' they say to you. Try to understand them, instead. You should learn Spanish. It's a very popular language, do you know? But not everyone will learn Spanish. Until you do, most will agree with you because they are either afraid to accept you or because they are anti-immigrant or just plain stupid.
1530	The statistics that I know of don't seem to show a definite increase in lying in court.  However, the statistics do seem to show people... I think that if people committed... deviant sexual... crimes... then their... percentage... of guilty parties will go down. That's a great... statistic... and one that is consistent with reality.
1531	I guess it's not that... the honesty in a court is likely...right? But if a court judge finds out...it would be dishonest of them to make a trial without evidence...so I think most people lie to investigators or anything else...and it's not that you would need to tell the truth all the time...hmmm....
1532	I... don't think... I'm sure there are people who lie in court all the time.  People are either honest or dishonest... I don't think that swearing to tell the truth will automaticaly want to make a dishonest person want to tell the truth... it just means that if they don't tell the truth when they swore to, then it's illegal.  And hey, if they are already on trial for something illegal, it's probably not going to bother them if they do something ELSE that's illegal.
1533	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure.  However, I think that people lie in court all the time.  People are either honest or dishonest...

1541	The legislature gave pervs the right to live for no reason. The legislature also gave pervs the right to...well, this...or the ability to be more predatory under the guise of being on welfare. If you must, take a parking break and pull off the road. It will make them feel better, by allowing them to face their deep-seated anger.\n\nIf you can, give the pervasors the truth. They will feel better, and you will feel better. If you don't, then you must live, no matter how painful it is.
1542	The text is probably missing the following from its original form. Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com) Along with the obvious safety benefits of a manual car (such as the fact that they are a lot more reliable when a gear is in the higher gears), its fuel economy advantage results in a significant decrease in gas consumption. We think this is definitely worth the majority of drivers' interests. Thus, we have ranked this policy as 4 stars.
1543	1) Constantly variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans. 2) The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety. 3) They are a liability trying to start on uphill roads. 4) They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys. 5) They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear. 6) They are also generally less safe than automatic transmission-based vehicles. They are also relatively more expensive to purchase and maintain. They also generally lack in safety over longer trips. They also lack in fuel economy. They also have relatively lower safety ratings over longer trips.
1544	I'll add some...arguments. There's plenty of stuff I've probably missed/gotten... Along with those...the car has a magic shift, start up is instant, has a great...MEDDCON? With magenta cab (the car is fastest out of all cars at present) Obviously gas mileage increased. How far uphill? "Magic shift" as in the car moves down the street uphill. Or what do you call the step-up stick? Magic? Tilt shift? Dash or revv shift? Tilt shift or revv shift? Yes
1545	I don't consider the spikes to be anti-homeless. The spikes are supposed to protect the customer base. In my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.
1546	"I just saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business."
1547	Please. Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs. Tesco is protecting their customer base. If it makes them more money, then they should be allowed to do it. Not... reading through my comments. I do not agree with these protesters, not... even if they do not. Please don't chide me, don't lecture me, don't bother to lecture me. I understand that some of you might have been smiling in a bad way when I made those comments. And that's something I can understand. Please forgive me.
1548	I see no problem with the spikes, if they are doing it to protect their customer base. Most homeless people don't know how to use the spikes to self...destruct themselves and endanger themselves. It may be... inconsiderate of homeless people but who knows what they think of spikes? I can't really comment on spikes because... I do agree with the bullies who keep sayin there are homeless people like the place that is sur...
1549	There are companies that do good, so it's important for them to exist. There are also protesters who are working for positive change, so it is important for them to exist.

1550	I am for the death penalty on moral reasons for every reason in the world other than crimes against humanity, as I think it concerns mankind in general. That being said, the use of capital punishment doesn't depend on just some people who are against the use of it, it goes against mankind itself. It has moral use for every crime...
1551	Killing a person is against humanity. Therefore, capital punishment should be used for something that goes against humanity itself. If you're... consider killing the worst offenders; where it is not... Remove the damn shackles. Didn't make any sense; looking back on it is pretty funny.The two sentences I wish... Getting it done quickly and correctly before I committed a crime.
1552	If that were the case, people would still kill other people because its against humanity. Capital punishment is only used for heinous crimes. It goes against humanity in every circumstance, therefore killing a person is against humanity and should therefore be stopped. There are some people in this world who still murder, rape, and rape their victims while lying down, not even being...
1553	As another example of a morally questionable act, I would turn my wife in for neglect. The death penalty should be used for neglect in a similar scenario as a situation in which my wife had abused me or other types of neglect. That's why I'm inclined to support the death penalty for such crimes. I see those crime examples as more morally questionable since they're extremely bad things that involve violence.
1554	I'm generally against the use of the death penalty. I... ...arguments against capital punishment rest in the fact that killing a person is against humanity. Therefore capital punishment should be used for something that goes against humanity itself. I can see why...  ...arguments for capital punishment rest in the fact that it's the correct moral...  ...arguments against capital punishment... Arguments for capital punishment...

1555	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor.
1556	Another change: Roe v Wade is a supreme court decision. There are different interpretations of Roe v Wade among Supreme Court justices. So, instead of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" they should be "pro-roe v wadge." Yes, the legislature should repeal Roe v Wade.
1557	Yes, you should have your women die. The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy.

1559	Abortion is a serious matter that requires serious discussion and consideration.

1560	Opera is great. It has all the best features of the browsers, but it's underrepresented. Take "Speed dial" for example. It puts your 9 most used bookmarks in the screen when you create a blank tab. It also has many add ons, but it's community is just beginning. As such, Opera will be releasing a new version of the browser; 9.52, which will have many enhancements, including speedier performance than any of it's competitors.

1562	Opera has many great features and plugins, such as Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Those tools are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox. There is another one though which goes to the heart of Opera's Core, the engine which runs every aspect of Opera. You can think of it as... the code that makes Opera better than... anything.

1565	I personally do not pay school fees and i am going to give to the ones who pay them.I don't want to be in poverty myself. I personally don't believe that people should be forced to pay for education, but instead want to have a way to help the ones who are less fortunate in life.
1566	Education should be free because it is one of the key ways to decrease poverty. If education was forced to have fees, the people in poverty would not be able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper.

1570	Yes... I would really consider it very possible. Even though the suspect is too small to be considered a martyr, it is still big news and could have been a traumatic incident for children. The world is open now enough to try to hide incidents like this. It could still happen.
1571	Yeah, the world is too open now to try to hide incidents like these. I can really see how it might happen. If anything, with the internet it's too easy to get news of these kinds, no matter where people live.

The food was great, including the bok choy, perhaps the chili pepper was not spicy. The service was OK, the young staff appeared happy, but given the slow cash out and that there were 3 in our group we gave them 3 stars. Although service was slow, the food was great.
1577	The staff are young.  The food was great.  The service was slightly slow but it has nothing to do with the fact that people waited in line and did not go out immediately once seated. The staff is older. We will dine here again but allow longer hours so as to catch up on payments. Our group waited for at least half an hour for a cashier to appear and take the money.  We believe this places... 3 stars
1578	The service is always slow at the checkout.  That may be because the people working there have no idea how to do it or they may be underqualified to work there.  I don't know.  However, the service was slow here on my last visit. Some people didn't have an idea how to do it or they may have no experience.  I don't know.  However, the service was slow here on my last visit. I'd give them 3 stars.
1579	If you have read some of the other reviews you will see that the service is an issue.  Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.  I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age.  Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience?  \nThe food was great.  The bok choy was outstanding. \nThe 3 stars is for the service.  5 stars would be for the food.

1605	You are trying to steer the debate away from what it is, because you cannot back up your claims. See above for more about what i did. As for my refrain, you might be aware of or at least understand what it is. Also, i said it is a red herring. As for "sabrejimmy," i called that your name.
1606	If you are going to back up your claims, it would be easier if you actually asked the person the question. For example, I asked an obvious question as: "Where do you stand on evolution?" SABREJIMMY replies: "STAND IN FAVOUR OF EVOLUTION" but because she did not ask her own question first, she is on a slippery slope.    You should prove that we are not evolving, rather than that we are evolving, and i dont' know where you stand on that............. On Evolution!
1607	I apologized in the opening post. I was just giving a response to the request. Well, it IS evolution. It was once again easy to prove that evolution happened. It wasn't shown in... any part. Evolution happened. Evolution has long been proven, all we are doing is giving details about it. Evolution does not show kids expressions and unforms. There is no requirement for evolution. Evolution is the starting point. Evolution has been known for many years. Evolution is the frontier. You have been waiting for quite a long time. Evolution is the foundation to this whole debate. Evolution is the foundation of this debate. Be assertive, not defensive.
1608	Calif. Parl. is located at pacificsun.com. You know, it's just like enrolling in enactment state courses at the university of wisconsin. You can't provide proof. You can't answer my questions. Even the concept of evolution needs to be proven. The big bang is not the explanation, so it isn't even a red herring.
1609	Okay, you brought up evolution and a big bang. That's not what i was trying to prove. I have been there and done that. Perhaps my best angle is focussed in the direction you want, that it is us, humans, which has decided evolution to begin with. Our ability to decide what to evolve has come with the genes; is that truly your argument?

1637	I believe so, and, since we are siblings of three, we have been spanked along with our sister and turned out to be disciplined. Thats why I believe that it should be used as a last resort at least.
1638	At least, we tend to think of discipline as a last resort because it dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it. School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are.

1655	In this situation, it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. I would definitely turn in my husband because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it.
1656	If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. If he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would think about it.

There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another child to add to their family, and the government does not have to take the child's life.
1665	A short time-frame here is about a century, so my daughter wouldn't expect to be sexually abused in that time-frame; therefore, having the attacker go on that date (more, see below) is only reasonable (why do you go off to a date after being sexually abused?).
1666	Forcing the authorities to discover who committed the crime might actually be bad for the person who committed it if he or she decided to kill himself or herself after learning that he or she had committed the crime and was subsequently arrested.  The more information that could be learned about what the person had done, especially if the person had committed a hate crime, the more likely that person would choose to...
1667	If it proves to be true, assuming we're talking about a reasonably short time-frame here, then you probably aren't okay.  If you gave a hurtful message, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.

Public transit can cause physical harm (incidents do occur) but it does not prevent young teens from driving after drinking.
1671	While people are going to say that this is just politics and not exactly the same issue and the reason why this question is asked, let me clarify. President Clinton (born in 1947) is actually the second president in history to have to deal with what is labeled illegal war--namely, The Iraqi Civil War, and nearly 3,000 Americans deaths that resulted. President Bill Clinton is in the record books as the only president to have to go to Congress for any particular war. President Clinton to go to Congress for an...
1672	It is president Bush who got us into Iraq, and people are screaming about an illegal war. President Clinton is always asking for wars, but they won't take all the money. It was the illegal war that didn't go well.
1673	Ple...I think that the President can not be making his policies out of a private conversation.He has to take them to a public place and that he can even face critics.you can't have a meeting with people without anyone being invited and ask them to leave.I am a Democrat.please remember that if you move against anyone, you move against the country.If someone is against your beliefs, it's because they are against the country.
1674	Frankly, I believe it is not just politics. It is the same issue. If it was wrong then, then there was a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are screaming about illegal wars to many different people during...
1675	Yes, most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. The whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed).
1676	Yes, most of them are hypocrites, and the DUI judge (I was a judge too) places people in jail, takes away their freedom. the whole town knows it, the lawyers, the cops, etc. we watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, (we followed).

1678	just go to court. that's how it is. don't know how we allow ourselves this. people shouldn't drive drunk. they should not drive at all. we've watched the cops pull people over and give them a ride home (we followed). that's how it is.
1679	Yes, they are hypocrites. We watched the cops pull him over one night and they gave him a ride home, but how can you fight it? He was in a drunk stupor.
1680	So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills. The person above is absolutely wrong.  Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally.

1685	Have no idea about veils though and ignore the issue, the content has nothing to do with veils, and if your government does not allow women to display their heads, why would the UK allow them to?  (This is blatant racism, it states 'racial prejudice'). Have no idea about veils but seriously think of the message the veil puts across as sexist, very divisive and more pernicious than a mask...
1686	I guess this woman should think of the possible effect her veil can have on others but I respect for asking for the veil to be removed.  I mean it isn't for very long and she was fighting for someone in court. So it is the right of her to ask for the veil to be removed, but, it would be advisable to think the person's opinion as well.... So in this case I think the right of the veil to be removed,  and the...
1687	If the judge could not hear her clearly or the face she covered was not understandable, the judge had a right to request the woman to remove her veil. While in Britain, veils are considered suspicious and form a barrier preventing the free exchange of ideas. Also, it is customary to cover the face. Let's not forget that Mrs. W...
1688	Being in Britain here where the covering your face is seen as suspicious, these women relly need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion. I also worry about the message it may be trying to send.  Is this personal, no the reporter based their discussion around a decision the judge made and potentially sent the reporter... no

1690	DUI is a unique case because there are special laws for it. However, the BAC (.08) is a better measure than reaction time. In that case, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. Anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.
1691	Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol use.

That's the reason why driver's license suspension and even complete revocation can be the only punishment for ...

1695	The statements about marriage and being against God are completely... disproportionate. The solution shouldn't be to make marriage a religious ceremony, nor should it be... no. Both statements are completely off-base and not supported by the facts. Personally, I would simply change marriage from a religious ceremony to a civil ceremony. Christianity has brought many bad things into the world. The mention of gays was absurd and without... reason. People do believe their God gave them "free will", do they?  so... why make marriage a religion? People are having a civil ceremony to accomplish the goals of those who do not. Just think about the unanswered questions.
1696	I don't, why don't you ask the the polytheistic god for the rules you've lost for all three of us in this argument  you would not.  make your own rules... who must you obey? ... he gave you free will don't you?  People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain.  atheists get married....
1697	I would leave people alone, but i am not gay.  gays get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain.  so all the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone, after all isn't it their God's job to judge them?  ......... well i bet they would leave the "sinners" alone, because their God (how could that be?) made them free will and free will
1698	Why not?  People complain it is against God.  so those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays.  MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse.  There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you  hear anyone complaining?  anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony.  People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain.  atheists get married.  what's the big deal?
1699	No, it does not show kids expressions and unforms, it does not show their innocence because school uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't show their innocence  because of their expression.  school uniforms do not let kids express their expressions because of their expression. People don't have to have faith in the Bible's words as the basis of their decisions.  not all atheists follow the rules that you offer.  not all atheists follow rules because they hate people or think their God did not give them free will. it's your God who created you and lives in you to look out for you, don't you?  ### Response: No
1700	I work downtown and the homeless problem is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. I think that any major city should develop faster by getting rid of the homeless problem. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
1701	I'm very mad about homelessness in the LA. Most of them look like they're mentally ill, and they're a nuisance to everyone. Los Angeles has many homeless camps and workers who help those who need help, and that could improve the area and make it better. For LA to be better, we need to have a homeless program with specialized staff to help those in need. As I work downtown LA, I have a feeling that the homeless problem is pretty bad, and that it needs to be taken into serious consideration. So, I think that...
1702	I think for any major city to develop faster it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. Also, for any major city to develop faster means it needs to be safer, especially during winter. The homeless are thieves, a nuisance, and they cause some crime. The LA subways need to be tighter and turnstiles. The homeless problems are a nuisance. I... No. But homeless men are... thieves, a nuisance, and they cause crime.
1703	I agree with the homeless problem. They should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental illness or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy. To get rid of the problem, we need to try an alternative approach. We need to develop a plan and help people understand and embrace that plan. You can read an excellent...
1704	You work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. The problems with the homeless are rooted in a mental illness ('mental illness' being a common, yet misunderstood, diagnostic term). The issue is really twofold: fear and pity.
1705	There are many things that Malaysia Airlines still does right. Whether or not you booked from Dublin and via Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur, the airline's record is relatively uneventful. Flight MH370 is still undetermined. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure.

1707	Last time I flew with Malaysia Airlines was 5 years ago, and I was pretty unhappy. Malaysia Airlines appears to have suffered a lot in that last 5 years, particularly in European region. And today, however, the stock price has returned to the origin after suffering a fall. This is indeed a reason to give them money back. I reserve the right to appeal the airline's decision, too. When I booked my flight with Malaysia Airlines around 2 hours before the MH17 crash, it was indeed the best offer that the airline would give me, so I accepted it without hesitation. I loved the service that Malaysia Airlines provides, and I would...
1708	I might consider taking them up on their offer of a refund. CMV  ### Input: I am sick of the newspaper talking about heat of the moment events while ignoring trivial trivia....  We can directly quantify the truthiness of this claim by performing sentiment analysis on the comments posted on the Washington Post website as of 12 November. 38 percent of them are negative and 72 percent positive. 1
1709	Malaysia Airlines has been involved in mishaps before. The one that is behind the MH17 tragedy is also know to be a crack baby. I'm not trying to make fun of Malaysia Airlines, but the airline company's stock price has soared substantially over the past few years, while the Malaysian Airlines stock price has seen a drop. Those remarks were made after reading the excerpt from a news report. Yes, your sentence can be modified to be: '[Y]ou have no idea how dangerous it is to park on the street, even though parking is notoriously difficult to do especially in the winter months.' Yes, the sentence can be modified to say: 'The insanity displayed in the news reports is what shows people need to consider their lives very carefully.' Yes, the sentence can be modified to say: 'The insane news reports do help highlight some of the unhealthy elements of our society.' Yes
1710	The ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital.... but would not be so popular, which is why democrats need to start paying their dues to the union. only assections have an obligation to state their allegiance to union members and good for them to pay their dues.
1711	I do not live in California. I am from Michigan and know how this works very well. I am not sure about how other states and states use time, but most states seem to let employers set their own policy as to time off for their workers. As such, California would be on the way to letting employers be able to impose unpaid time off by arguing that what the employer is trying to do is to return work to the workforce. There is already an unfair practice with the way the state handles time off for employees.
1712	The democratic party collects the most money from PACs. As a union guy, I think it is important that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. As... when a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1713	I feel that the democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I...I think that corporations control more money than any other group. There's a... lot of influence from corporations. There's already... much undue influence by corporations that I... think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would... be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a... politician wants to... curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds... me of state socialist... countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1714	It was my understanding that you were disappointed in the ability to fund pro-union politicians. I would argue that undue influence by corporations takes money away from staffing unions, the power of staff to make money and therefore the power of the worker to make the same impact. In...

1715	Yes, Friends come and go over time. But i have lived in the same house as my family my whole life. they have been the most constant presences in my entire life.

1720	Before having sex......my favorite memory was... being with my first love before it all started..... she had long hair, cute red lips, cute tits, nice long legs, deep hips, and white underpants I like how strong she is, and her voice....I couldn't get out of my head, and I like her so much.... not so much for her looks (only because of the red lips and nice long legs but I really like her because of her personality and because she seems like a good person....
1721	before.....i have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so i will consider it the same thing. when you have sex with the same person for a long time it seems like a routine with less experimentation, same position, same girl, same everything... it seems that it used to be so much better....you get turned on by being with someone new, new experience, so if you can find a...

Sex is much better if you have lots of... not if you are married and still feeling the same thrill. If your hormones are out, then that's why it feels like a routine. Sex for you is much better if you are on the new type of  drugs. If the...
1723	As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment, sex was much better earlier in relationships, as sex is always much better/exciting when you're with someone you like. Something that you don't get or for which you can't keep your hands on eachother. After a long time...Sex becomes a routine where excitement of sex is...less
1724	Before......I have never been married but have been with someone long enough to be commonlaw so I will consider it the same thing. As far as sex comes it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage/long term commitment. With the same person it is much better because you become physical so much and the body comes closer together. After a long time having sex with the same person the quanity and quality both began to subside.
1725	I guess I should offer to pay $16 for the first 2 hours in the valet area. It's easier to load the bathroom truck. I'm always on my phone. I would never trust valets. I wouldn't get into a fight with a valet or a parking attendant. A lot of places put valets on touchdowns and parking lots. I would never trust valets. Valets are the worst people you can deal with. If the valet or parking attendant says, "You are going to get suspended," I would take them on my words. I'd park around the casino and park farther away from the valet. The hotel valets say there are no parking regulations at the hotel, so I can park anywhere and still feel free.
1726	The valet at Mandalay Bay is free, it's the MGM corporation that is greedy. The Venetian doesn't charge for valet. They are so greedy. All their hotels are doing this. You should rant about the valet here. The valet at Mandalay Bay is free. The casinos just rip everything off.
1727	MGM is the MGM Corporation. All their hotels are doing this. So if you want to rack up valet fees, go to the MGM Resorts casinos. It is a hotel chain, not a casino chain. Just bring your parking passes from the MGM to Mandalay. I don't see any evidence of this being misrepresentation.
1728	Valet for the first 2 hours at the Venetian parking is free. The MGM corporation runs their hotels. So the next time you run into a casino this outrager is exactly the rant you're looking for. The casinos just rip everything off. So flood the parking lot. Get in a mini van.
1729	I totally agree. Don't leave the casino parking for the valet. Don't even let the valet take your money if you're staying at the Mandalay Bay. That's true. I'm sure the casinos can't stand the bad press that they're getting from this for the valet. Just...long story short....   Thank you for the thoughtful and...
1730	The service is spot on. We enjoyed the atmosphere at Elev...Our group of 10 loved the sushi. Service is spot on, proxoitity to the action of Vegas inside & out. We appreciate the sushi. Will be back.
1731	Thanks.. Sushi was on point delicious and fresh for our group of 10. Service was spot on. Proximity to the action of Vegas inside & out. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show for sure. Gotta pay to play my friends and this joint is worth your dime.
1732	I don't have a right to comment but... Not so great experience with waitress who never checked on us and had food arrived cold. Then to hear customer complained about his hair. He also... Overall our dining experience was good. Was very satisfied to try sushi from one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas!

1735	They should have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things. And, as for uniforms, such things as a school tie, would help students focus more on their work. Also, as a school leader, uniforms could prevent the setting up of rival gangs and other problematic areas in school.
1736	Uniforms should not have rules of its own, and as such, uniforms shouldn't be created. Schools shouldn't be making their own rules, and as such, shouldn't create dress codes for their own students.
1737	Schools should not create dress codes. On the one hand, uniforms help student focus more on thier work. On the other, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school(kids are highly impressionable....). Schools should not create dress codes.
1738	Schools shouldn't create dress codes. On one hand, kids are allowed to express themselves to a large extent but... schools should have rules to prevent students from wearing certain things. like uniforms.
1739	I do not know what clothes children wear in schools and definitely, I am not into uniforms. The school... They need to break up the lines.... I think some of the dress rules should be really tight and uniforms should not be one of them. I would like schools to break up the uniform rules and... a better class system.
1740	The reason wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesn't want the students to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
1741	School uniforms will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school does not want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
1742	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is that it is good to make sure that the uniform covers every part of the body that the school does not want the students to show.
1743	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is because the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesn't want the students to show. It also won't get in the way.
1744	Another good thing about wearing a school uniform is the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school does not want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
1745	School uniforms do not prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
1746	School uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are.
1747	Children wear what their parents say to them. Just some reason why i prefer Firefox
1748	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.
1749	School uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful, not only once the child is out of school, but in general.
1750	Yes. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. I dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. But it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.

1755	My wife will never leave me. Murder is a unforgivable mistake, but love is not. I made a commitment to stay with my wife through the rough times.
1756	A person can find love through any mistake, but it makes you that much more... less likely to be a murderer. So I recommend that you confide in... your wife.
1757	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what happens. I made a commitment to stay with her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1758	I love my wife more than anything in the world and I would do anything for her. Murder is a unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1759	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1760	On the one hand, I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. It could have been an accident, but it was still wrong, and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person. On the other hand, I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time, so i'm a bit torn in this regard.
1761	With that he did, i would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one person. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
1762	I would not turn him in if he killed a more than one person. I think if I loved the person enough I could hide the facts, and I would act like it never happened.
1763	This isn't true... I would make my partner come home with bloody cuts that are never explained. No one should be doing something that makes them physically battered up. This is completely unacceptable. So I wouldn't turn him in unless he killed more than one... it could have been an accident, but it was still wrong and besides, the police are going to find out who killed that person...
1764	It does not seem like you really loved the person to the degree that you could hide the facts and act like it never happened.

1766	Books don't ruin your eyes like TV. does. Also, books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you, which is very important. If you don't read a lot of books, you won't have to do things like spell, write, or think well. On the other hand, watching TV can help you learn to spell, write, and think poorly.
1767	Books allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. Also, books allow you to criticize authorities because someone else has done so before you. Reading books can make you better at spelling, allowing you to cut the bad guys' tricks, help you with your vocabulary, and even make you better at writing. Read a good book. Can't ... not right now.
1768	Books, like TV, don't ruin your eyes. They allow your brain to imagine rather than doing it for you. Reading a lot can help you with spelling. Reading books a lot can help you write better. Reading books a lot can also teach you how to read. Plus, reading books can teach you to read faster. Watching TV can help you learn faster, too.
1769	Books let your brain to imagine, rather than being done for you by watching TV. Reading books a lot can help you to learn how to write better. It also teaches you to read. Watching TV. doesn't.

1775	Keeping abortion legal will help save lives by eliminating the need to have to illegaly abort a child and kill themselves at the same time.

1779	Abortion is a disaster because it contributes to more traffic accidents, it takes more lives, it puts other lives at risk because of unsafe abortions, it contributes to more drug use, it causes more legal problems, and it takes lots of resources to regulate. In short, abortion causes all sorts of problems.
1780	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "I think it is an honor to help out others." Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance.
1781	No way. As one commenter noted, those kinds of social interactions do not mean anything to them.  They do not feel they have anything to gain out of it and it would not make them feel good as well as themselves. Before any person decides to help people, they first have to consider why they are doing it.  It may be that a person feels obligated to help.  Maybe they enjoy helping others.  Perhaps they want others to feel good as well as themselves.  These reasons would be valid reasons to help people. Also, others may... their ego
1782	Yes, it takes a lot of people to make things happen. When people help others, they feel better and this puts them in a better mood. So you make them feel better, which makes people else want to help themselves, which makes...

Examples of such motives include, pride, revenge, status, wealth, and entertainment. See: When... because you don't respect anyone else.
1783	People only help out if they feel good about it. Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. So when helping out, you make others feel good as well as yourself. Being in a venture purely for oneself is a time that you get to spend with your mate, or with your family/friends, or with your pets. So if you are in a venture purely for oneself, or for others, there are numerous ways you could spend your time. To spend time in a venture purely for you or others, you would do so...

1803	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after being given numerous warnings, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1804	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several warnings, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.
1805	Spanking teaches you to be better, and to stop doing things you should not do. I support this because I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter. Spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
1806	It does not show kids expressions and unforms does not show is it. Spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.

1810	In the matter of killing a child, there is no excuse in the world. It is the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
1811	There is no excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. It's not the woman's fault, and the baby would want to live.
1812	There is no excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. If the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. The mother with the baby, whoever they are, should speak for the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
1813	If the woman was raped, it most certainly is the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
1814	There isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. a police officer should have shown more professionalism and prevention, and should have done more to help her. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak for the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.

1820	It is a philosophy of life (and death?). It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children. legislators get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. There are circumstances in which our legislators straddle the fence, in regards to raising children. Our legislators try to take the middle path. One thing we should not do is try to kill people for their own beliefs. Another thing that you should not do is to kill people for their own beliefs.

And the basic aim is to do what's right. Simple enough.

To set a uniform standard, then we would create an artificial barrier against freedoms, such as liberalism.  We would have to set limits for freedoms in our society.

If a minister teaches bible, that's one thing, but pastor's like Rod Parsley, who for years has flaunted his political view's, and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose his tax exempt status forthwith. Not to mention he's a millionaire many times over.
1835	I don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end. I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.
1836	I really like the points and I can't agree with this answer any more. The real world is difficult and a simulation world, like this, is a great alternative. But sometimes, it isn't enough. I'd rather have a "normal life" inside the simulation and of course, that would be difficult and a tough life but it would also be a happy life.

1838	It sounds like you miss the point. It is NOT nice to spend your life constantly wondering about when it would all come to an end. The point of life, as everyone has known for many centuries, is the pursuit of happiness and the reality of death. It is why the writer is saying that life is not worth living if you can't enjoy it. Although many people enjoy life, the writer, personally, does not enjoy living.
1839	Like what you have said, sometimes the most difficult thing in life is to be happy without having a mind of its own. Instead of trying to figure out what to do in real life, I prefer to live in a simulator because that allows me the freedom to do whatever I want, and to live a different life than normal people do. It makes me feel better about myself and it gives me more time to think about something important.
1840	Is there something special that senior citizens are entitled to? Retirement is like an estate paid to them by society.  One of those estates has to do with pension obligations.  The first two alone cost an impressive amount for a 65 year old person who works in a service or manufacturing sector.  That's right, a person who was earning minimum wage in 1965 just about earned approximately $12,816.  In 2019, a person who worked minimum wage earned an average of $16,/or $17, depending on the year you live.
1841	Businesses shouldn't (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces. So much so that they should not give discounts for senior citizens and armed forces, especially if the nation's strict liquor laws apply to them. Firefighters... the role that has always been considered as more valuable that many other professions because of the potential danger that they face. Recently though the average sum taken out by a firefighter at work has only gone up... Recently an industry survey has shown that senior...
1842	Businesses should...no, don't give discounts to senior citizens and the armed forces. Sad but true. But if... to the extent of... yes, give them discounts. Why they want it is up to them (and hey, you might want to consider which of your policies offer discounts if your employer does not).  Check your insurance policies to see how you are doing with them. If not, talk with your insurance agent to know what you can do for a discount.
1843	A business that gives discounts to senior citizens and armed forces is a fine idea.  Their actions are based on the freedoms and privileges that these populations have already agreed to give to them by entering the union.    Those people who voluntarily gave up their liberties are considered a valuable contribution towards society.   So we do have the right to keep our money so that we can enjoy life and entertain ourselves.  Given all of the benefits, we can keep our money.   Agreed.

You might also want to take time to review 14607.4, whether or not you live in California. After three suspensions, you should consider stopping driving.\n\nFeel free to comment any other view. For instance:   I disagree with the writer. If the law allows it, I think people should be able to keep driving after three suspensions. The car insurance may increase if you're considered impaired. Los Angeles and surrounding area is expensive. I believe it is illegal. Stop drinking and drive responsibly
1846	A long while ago, Putin ordered all his government officials to close offshore accounts. He ordered all government officials to buy Russian made cars. And wealthy Russians use other countries to skate around Russian taxes. Now the US and EU are sanctioning business and people (I try to keep up on all the sanctions but I lose track). Europe buys from Russia much needed gas, and in turn, Russia buys things from Europe. They have a nice little ecosystem.

Islamic extremists have made "pretty much" every country in the world "Islamic" for the past few years, which is why they have to go through extremely strict Islamic laws to keep them quiet.

They see them as terrorists, a threat against the country's goals.

It seems like if I could just learn about extremism, I could better understand why people do bad things.

People... people caus... people cause horrific things, extremists don't cause horrible things, but they seem to and extremists do horrible things because extremists do the... extremists do horrible things because they are evil.

1863	As long as opinions are expressed in a respectful way I am all for them. Why do you continue to take stuff out of context, and post for nothing, when you're responding to someone's comments? You are constantly creating trouble. You are not making a progress. You are making a distraction, and you're a tool. I've heard other people's comments and I truly regret them. So please refrain from making more things. But I would still like to provide this comment as a last-ditch effort because it... actually does make a difference.
1864	Yes - mental health is very important and part of the equation. I don't think it is "offensive" that mental illness affects people's ability to function. The "misogyny" part is what is making your post so off-putting. People have responded thoughtfully to the issue of mental health and the issue of sexism in regards to the shooting in Orlando. It is actually very reassuring to see that people recognize that it is both reasonable to see that the mental health issue must be factored into this situation but that it also highlights the danger of taking things too far.
1865	Welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare is bad! Welfare also reduces incentives for the lower class to move up. Welfare means that the government... Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare also means having to... Welfare is bad!
1866	Welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television, making them... Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth, welfare means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television, welfare means having to pay for some fat ass that didn't know any better than to eat at McDonalds every day.
1867	Welfare does not reduce incentives for the lower class to move up. Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare means having to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare is bad!
1868	The people would not enjoy anything if they received welfare. Welfare means taxing people more, making them spend less and reducing business growth. Welfare also means being forced to pay for your neighbor's new television. Welfare is bad.
1869	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them be content where they are. Welfare makes sure that every welfare recipient pays more taxes, which makes them spend less, and it also reduces business growth. Welfare is bad.
1870	To choose where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people. For example, a family of four would check education, and their money would go towards...
1871	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.
1872	Instead of taxes being spent where it doesn't really affect people, say they should be spent towards schools and where there is a strong need for them. They can then choose which groups they want to help out more, and money should go towards those things that are more relevant to a given area.
1873	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.
1874	We don't need a government that thinks it can prevent our taxes from going to the education system, or to the health care system, or to places to which no one in this area cares. As a corollary, we don't need a government that thinks it's able to keep our... say they never got sick.
1875	School uniform is very convenient because it reduces the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is cheap but good , it reduces sense of inferiority among teenagers and it also makes it easier for pupils to take the bus. However, this is the case in other countries, school uniform is not common.
1876	'The teachers like plain clothes. They encourage kids to wear to school uniform to carry out the law. The school uniform does not show kids expressions and unforms does not show is it, that is why the poor students feel inferior. However, the school uniform is cheaper and the poor students can...
1877	It is cheap, better than plain clothes, convenient, sense of kinship and sense of belonging, but it's also expensive. Because school uniform is based on the class system , which is unfair. It is better to wear plain clothes, a nice pair of shoes, and a good pair of hair.
1878	I like school uniform. I think it does not show kids expressions and unforms. These are the only reasons why i prefer it. If I... school uniform is more relaxing, they would rather wear plain clothes. I think school uniform is ... a fashion statement. It may not show students'...
1879	Yes, school uniform is very comfortable, because there's a gap between the rich and poor. Also, school uniforms can make students feel more comfortable and make their good impression on people who see them. Everyone should wear school uniforms because it is better for everyone's appearance, health, and well-being.
1880	While trying to find their own minds is not bad. It is to much fun when people get mixed up in a public discussion.
1881	When there young and trying to find themselves there is no need to get rid of their independence. I also vote bad.
1882	When there are young and trying to find them selves there is no need to get rid of the matter. I vote bad.
1883	When there young and trying to find themselves, there is no need to...
1884	When there young and trying to find them selves there is no need to get rid of there independence. I think that there younger people should learn to be more independent and not be so inclined to getting married.
1885	No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know, and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING...he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason...
1886	No, I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me
1887	I would not tell on my wife, especially to someone who is violent and a psychopath...because he will kill me. That is how I feel about my wife...he may want to kill me...that is why I would not...for that very reason.
1888	Yes I would, cause I wouldn't let him down........he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me... [...]
1889	Yes you and I would definitely go to the police. he and I are best friends and you would get to know me better. seriously the whole world would know I'm married to a murderer.
1890	TV isn't always better than books, but some TV shows are. Some TV shows are great and provide viewers with things that they're not aware of.
1891	I would say books are always better than TV. Books give more knowledge and reading provides a chance to reflect on life and your real life.
1892	Books are always better than television because television is complete junk and is really a waste of your time. A lot of programming falls into the camp of low-brow
1893	Books are always better than TV, because they give us more knowledge, and we learn it. Of course, it is not bad to...
1894	Of course, you should read books rather than watching TV. Books are always better than TV for many reasons; most importantly, they give you a lot of knowledge
1895	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population.
1896	Farquhar was... Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar... It was not the first time Raffles had done this, and Raffles thought Farquhar was... By later, Raffles had restored him to his position.
1897	This is somewhat hard to wrap my head around. Raffles sacked Farquhar because he was adopting measures that... Her Majesty's Government is confused, and in some cases, ignorance seems to be the answer. We do not want the poor to be more poor, but certainly we do not want to make children from working-class backgrounds more alienated from society. Just because someone had a child under the age of 18 with someone older and in a more fertile age doesn't mean they were having an affair. If so, it is much more likely that they had consensual sex in order to protect their own teenage children and not because
1898	Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population, and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart. Some people put their full faith in others, and when people put their full faith in others, they see those that they put their full faith in as sources of power and threats. Raffles sacked Farquhar for the best...

I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart.
1900	Start at a young age, or you won't get any weight loss results.
1901	How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?
1902	If you don't start at a young age, who are going to stop obesity?
1903	Children's obesity is a growing problem in the country. Sadly, lifestyle choices that will result in childhood obesity are far too often made on a daily basis, and parents
1904	We need to lower calories, lower fat, do less physical activity, and lower sugar at an early age. Why not raise our already overweight kids.
1905	When Farquhar was sacked, thousands of people cheered him farewell and bade him farewell that day. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
1906	He is very important to the people. Farquhar was sacked because he was accused of... He was sacked because he was accused of...
1907	Farquhar won the affection and respect from the people with his doings. He was sacked, and thousands of people bade farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
1908	It shows that Farquhar was... he was sad because they made a fool out of him. However, this is the way that people show their...
1909	Farquhar won the affection and respect of the people with his doings. When he was sacked, thousands of people bade him farewell on the day he left Singapore. This proves that Farquhar is very important to the people.
1910	I choose pro-life because it is more... highly moral. I believe that unborn babies are sentient beings that have their own conscious and intelligent minds that they can choose to live or not. I also believe that mothers should not be forced into...
1911	I choose pro-choice because I have the choice to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
1912	Pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro life I have no choice.
1913	I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
1914	I choose pro-life because I have the option to choose pro choice. If I choose pro choice, I have no choice.
1915	I see the big bang is a theory used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away, the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense.
1916	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. Evolution is the theory that humans, angels, horses, and the dinosaurs all evolved from an ancestor. Scientists can prove that we are all from the same place and that scientists found more fossil that support the theory. "Big Bang Theory" is a term that scientists use to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe. Scientists know that because the big bang theory was part of the big bang theory. When the big bang started the universe became hotter. Earth was the perfect place for life because it had the "Goldilocks conditions.
1917	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, then amphibians, then land animals, then humans.

1919	Yes, science has proven that evolution is the beginning of life. The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that began the creation of the universe.

1920	Your father was a lousy father and you didn't deserve him. His actions did not define him. That man is a reprobate and you do not deserve him. His actions did not define him. You got to know him while you were growing up. His actions did not define him. You got to know him while you were growing up.
1921	Lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach you what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all.
1922	A lousy father would be able to teach you a lot, maybe he could teach you how not to act, how not to treat your family. That's better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will know who he was and never wonder...
1923	A lousy father would teach you more than no one at all. He could toughen you up. It would be better than no teaching at all. He would know who you were and you would never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.
1924	A lousy father could teach you more than no one at all. He will at least be able to teach you what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all.
1925	Plastic is not bad for transporting materials and it is very light weight.
1926	Plastic is a good for distributing...but this is so wrong a good thing for problems.
1927	Plastic is a good alternative to lead because it is lightweight, durable, and doesn't accumulate like lead.
1928	Plastic is good because it's light weight, and a good for ditrabutions.
1929	Plastic is very good because it is light weight and good for distributions.
1930	From a biological standpoint, men and women were engineered to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1931	I prefer that men and women were "engineered" to be together instead of being on a date. The idea that men and women should be on a date came from society, and it was an idea that was corrupted by morals and society of our time.
1932	Biologically speaking, men and women were "engineered" to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1933	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered to be together" when the first human offshoot stood at... 17 centimeters
1934	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together, and this idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.
1935	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1936	History proves that there was no creator of the universe and no religion, so Christianity is not logical, common sense, rational, rational, just a way for people to cling to, to keep people from questioning the evidence and refuting it themselves. It also probably...
1937	i am an atheist, and i suggest you do the same. Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close).
1938	On the one hand, Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1939	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
1940	Science is NOT perfect, that's the difference between Science and Religion. Science admits it's doesn't have all the answers while Religion is so dogmatic that it won't even even recognise facts. And even just what "truth" really stands for.
1941	No one ever said science is "perfect." That's the difference between Religion and Science, Science admits it doesn't have all the answers while Religion is SO dogmatic so that it doesn't even recognise FACTS. And even just what TRUTH really stands for.
1942	Science is constantly evolving and no one has the answer for everything even science itself doesn't. If you... Science admits that it doesn't have all the answers while religion is so dogmatic...
1943	I don't agree with anyone saying that science is perfect and always definitive. That's the difference between religion and science: science admits that it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is so dogmatic that it refuses to acknowledge and celebrate TRUTH. Science can't ever eradicate education as fast as religion; truth exists to shine light and shed light upon what religious faiths accept and accept what religion cannot accept. Science can't...
1944	If science says that there is no proof, if it is not true, then then YOU don't like it, that is YOUR choice. It doesn't mean it is not true.
1945	No i would drop it like it was dropping from a ball because a dying child is not worth it.......
1946	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
1947	Yes, because... If you lose your ability to walk, you will lose the ability to communicate. Children learn very easily from example. This is why you should watch what your child does when you are around.
1948	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
1949	Yes, because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.
1950	I believe you should spank a child only when he knows he is wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1951	To spank a child, you first need to know if they are wrong. If they don't know, then you do not know if they are...
1952	Yes, I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1953	Yes I believe that it should be done when the child knows that they are wrong and act upon it. The child will learn better to not do the same mistake by acting upon it. Actions speak louder than words.
1954	Yes, I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1955	A person has the right to punish a child, but I think we should minimize it to a minimum and as long as the punishment is a minor, it wouldn't last longer than one minute.
1956	I don't think spanking should be necessary, because a... it dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it
1957	I don't think that spanking should be necessary. Spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
1958	I don't think that spanking should be...spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.  ### Instruction:
1959	I personally hate spanking and think that it should never be necessary, however, it can last up to 2 weeks or even more. Since any types of punishment are considered...
1960	No I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person... Currently, I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
1961	Yes I would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but I don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so I would tell but then again I wouldn't.
1962	On the one hand, I consider it to be the right thing to turn in my wife. If my spouse killed a person out of self-defense or out of defense for another person, then no I wouldn't turn them in, because someone that's that cold could kill me. On the other hand, if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
1963	No I wouldn't turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in.
1964	No, I wouldn't turn them in. If someone is that cold heartedly they could kill me. if someone rapes me, for... yes I would turn them in because no one rapes me. if they rape me for money and or intent for money then no I wouldn't turn them in because they're robbers and or rapists.
1965	No, it doesn't say that in the Declaration of Independence
1966	Yes, the Declaration of Independence states that we have the right to life liberty and the purist of happiness, but not...
1967	The Declaration of Independence does not specifically say...we have the right to life, liberty, and the purist of happiness.
1968	The declaration of independence (1776) does not mean that its in the law.
1969	Now that you mention it, it does say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life liberty and the purist of happiness. Is it not also part of the reason why you're upset about uniform schools?
1970	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit.
1971	One of the most common excuses for the age limit to have a drink is that the human brain does not develop completely at the age of 18. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit to have a drink. I personally believe that if you are old enough to die for your country you should be old enough to have a drink.
1972	I believe that... it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit.
1973	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit.
1974	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not complete at the age of 18, which poses a risk of more serious damage being caused from alcohol in an 18-year-old. Whether true or not, it seems to be a common excuse for the age limit.
1975	That is exactly why there are courts to deal with rape cases. However, one fine line may be statutory rape, in which the so called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.
1976	Rape is wrong in a variety of ways and it should be considered a crime.  It is not just committed by men...I know of many women who have been raped. A few of the factors, such as,... Hide/Don’t Leave Me!
1977	One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases. Whether or not that line is being crossed or not is subjective.
1978	If it were not rape, then there would be no rape to to... Retrieve a criminal statute and cite it... see 'o' and 'b' in it; yes' vs. 'no.'  See statute #15.01(a): "The subject... sexually... assault any... unmarried... person of the opposite sex of the subject... your... under the age of.... 21." Note also that a youth may be "gang-raped."  The rapist may be formally criminalized under CA Penal Code 420.1. The rapist or other threats will be held criminally liable. That is, the criminal's "act was... sexual assaulting the victim."  It's important to check with the pertinent... statute which cannot be improperly used with the meaning of (a). That... assault a... under the age of... 18."
1979	Rape is defined as: the sex act in which one party has force, violence, or fear under duress, thus making their sex act involuntary.  It is true that rape happens to a large degree, but there are many offenses that are considered rape.  If the individual had no power over the victim or had force, then rape is not considered to occur.  The trick, however, is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not.
1980	Yes. They are trying to start a conversation about safety versus freedom. In most cases, the traffic laws are designed to protect us from harming ourselves. If we were just honest and said that these laws are in place to save money, I think most of us would find them much less distasteful. Yes. Because they are trying to start a conversation about safety versus freedom. In most cases, the traffic laws are designed to protect us from harming ourselves. If we were just honest and said that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of a person's health care if they've chosen self harming behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much more acceptable.
1981	It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws.  We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm.  What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives."  I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers for picking up the cost of medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior.
1982	It seems to me that you just don't want to take responsibility for what you and others have chosen. You really have no idea about our society's laws. You seem to find yourself wanting to debate something you are unable to define. Perhaps you could make an effort to learn your history. If you can't do that, then you need to cut back on your interactions with "your group." Remind yourself that you are not in a position to judge others.
1983	Tell them that they can find out more about their laws by... looking them up on Google.com  or Wikipedia.com.... and, if they say they want a refund, remind them that some forms of self-harm are specifically covered under certain acts like AS 11312.3. (They seem more likely to get their refund if they tell them they were just following their state... and that they knew that everything is legal in California.) or explain what it...
1984	I would want to pass laws to protect ourselves from harming ourselves. The... in real life things are not always as black and white as they're presented in movies and reality shows. But I believe in treating things as they really are if they are not. So, you know, if you're in a rush and you don't want to be disturbed and you just don't want to be asked what your plans are, then you don't want to talk about them. The police are... Because what the police do is violates your privacy.
1985	Cigarettes should be illegal. That should save countless peoples' health and lives. It would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer. That is a loss of money. Those who support cigarette legality are losers. That is true. Slayballs selling death deserve to be jobless.
1986	If cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer.  i don't think that is a loss of money. it would only save lives and money. besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day.
1987	I agree...indeed...if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer; indeed, I don't think that is a loss of money. it would only save lives and money. besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day.
1988	unfortunately, cigarettes will be illegal. a better analogy is that one mother quit smoking because she was sickened by it. she said she was glad to see new people under the influence of nicotine. but she later said it could have killed her to continue to smoke, so she quit. those who still believe cigarettes will be legal are losers.
1989	However, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless peoples' health and lives. it would save hospitals thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer.  i don't think that is a loss of money. it would only save lives and money. besides, cigarette industry deserves to crash. i would love to see that day.
1990	One could easily make an arguement that the system is now not seperate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools. Thanks to Obama the situation is worsening due to the ability to fund his wars, while the minorities in the U.S. are not able to fund their schools. The...

1992	I think the argument is two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the intergration of the whole of America, not just in education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but seperate". However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. I agree that the whole concept of local versus centralized school funding might benefit that issue. There is more money out there that can fund local schools, but I wonder if school funding should be distributed differently.
1993	Well, it's kind of difficult to differentiate the spirit of the law and the letter of the law, when most of the time the spirit will be decided on by the case's facts and circumstances. There is no way to determine the spirit of the law unless there are...wait, we can't determine the spirit of the law if the facts are vague or... no, we can't determine the spirit of the law if the facts are not clear or... and...
1994	I think its really two different questions. The letter of the law and the spirit of the law. The most important thing is the letter of the law, not the spirit of the law. We have a huge problem when a person can now literally change the definition of gender by simply changing his pronation while talking and understand what they are saying. When parents are afraid to discipline their children due to their character, in other words, if the reason for punishment is not love, what then becomes the reason for the punishment? If we allow a person to change what he perceives as gender, then he can also choose to change his clothing. The only thing we can control is what people wear.
1995	Tell them you were summoned away at college and was waived/excused twice.  You shouldn't have a problem with it. Most people will excuse you if you were not really in town at the time. If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education.
1996	I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice. If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1997	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. ...and not come back. I have had previous complaints concerning how or if I write something in class, and this is yet another example, but I always get it right...So I guess I guess I shouldn't worry about it...I am awfully happy that I have never been told at the gym, or at work, or anywhere else for that matter to 'drop off work'...!!  I realize how lack of service is bad, but to be so consistently picky at work, then am never...what am... I must be stupid... And I guess I must be... completely stupid.... as well. ... and... my script is too long...so that's why I
1998	Let them know what was posted here. In a college situation, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it. However, you should never have... Tell them exactly what was posted...
1999	That's it. Remember, you should excuse or re-schedule anyone who has an office visit, who's got an appointment, or is on furlough....because they are supposed to be busy!
2000	Those states have the right to create their own gun laws. They've done so in the past. So, because they got an illegal gun on the street, why should they stop selling it to people? They have a right to do so. Why would a private law be required to affect something? It is a federal issue. Why would the state laws let the individual get a gun, which is a federal issue, and state law don't even allow certain types of guns to be sold in the state. Why not ban... A common law issue.
2001	Yes, if you're in the southern states, maybe they have different laws about... they are under the state. in states that allow handguns, there is a 3 day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase.
2002	Because there's no national standard. States should not be allowed to create their own gun laws, which is what North Carolina is doing. Gun laws should be backed by a national standard. States that don't have a national standard and act like North Carolina are forcing honest people to pay ridiculous fees to buy hand guns. They should be forced to check for criminal records and then pass a background check in a sheriff's office to purchase a hand gun. States are making people...more...more...more...more...more....more.....more...more....more.....more....more.....more.....more.....more.....more......more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more.....more
2003	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated fire arms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it.
2004	North Carolina has a three day waiting period to purchase a hand gun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state mandated firearms safety course, go to your county's sheriff's office and fill out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search and fill out an application for hand gun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of what ever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it.
2005	High school students typically use the internet as a last resort to find academic writing prompts, which tend to lack contextual clues. They also don't have the background knowledge to write credible arguments, so they end up plagiarizing those of other sources.   In this example, the narrator has a rare perspective on the ways the press profit from staged arguments.
2006	The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example.  While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured.  The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US. These are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox. There are many more reasons why I prefer Firefox.
2007	Let me put this in school uniforms...We shouldn't let kids show their true nature. Freeze frames while doing that. It's also possible to edit photos. Yes, it is possible to remove images from videos.  There are programs like Placehold.io and Mind Means. Searching for "placehold.io" may be useful. It allows you to put graphics or images in place of a spot that needs them.
2008	The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Some will say Guantanamo was an excellent example, while other people will say it's an abjection, but the reality is neither are true. The incredible fact about Guantanamo is that it wasn't horrific to prisoners. In fact, one survivor stated: "Quite frankly, I would turn in my wife." It is true that guards mistreated prisoners, but Guantanamo prisoners weren't treated any differently to prisoners in the US. As for force-feeding prisoners while they are on hunger strike, the UN has determined that it's torture, and the US has decided that force-feeding is torture.
2009	As long as the cops find people when they arrive, using force is justified in certain cases. Guantanamo was a huge example of this.  However, over and over again people do not report whether they've been tortured or not....therefore, the status quo is justified in cases such as Guantanamo.  Practically speaking, the US has always been operating under a kind of hyena power, largely justified by criminal acts and bribing cops.  The UN is guilty of taking them on, again... to the advantage of the US and its allies.
2010	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries.

Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in Europe. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income.

2013	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. I'm moving to a place where it is far less taxing than the US. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.
2014	Another benefit Singapore has is that they have really strong safeguards against civil disobedience, or you will be arrested and could be fined or imprisoned. In some countries, civil disobedience is... for 30 days! Can you be in charge of somebody else's life and not be confident about your...
2015	If you can't think of anything, go to CS class. It is maybe one of the best classes to pick if you want to be an engineer. School uniforms do not allow kids to express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are. They should change things up and not put everyone in the same class.  A: school uniforms do not allow kids to express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are.
2016	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually...
2017	Unfortunately schools do not place students in classes based on their ability level. The only way I think they should would be based on their ability, however they probably don't do this either. All states should do this. One way they could do this is to change the... A good percentage of students hate their classes. Most of this is a result of teaching styles, how things are done, and some other factors. However, students should be...
2018	If students are not especially good in one subject, they should be put in easier classes so they can actually learn. Thats why most students chose easier classes but i understand that not everyone has the option. If you are poor it does not matter if you...The education system is broken on all levels, from tuition to evaluation and placement. To put it another way, education is just a business.  ### Response: Students are complaining about their education system because it is...broken. Just because they aren't being challenged and forced to work towards higher levels.
2019	Students should be in classes based on their ability level, instead of being put in classes because they did bad in one subject. The reason students don't achieve a good grade in one subject is because many students try to outdo each other and that is how it works. Every school has advanced classes, and students are pretty easy to find because they are smart.
2020	Well, the world is one big chaotic system. Literally EVERY SINGLE choice we make, even subcobscious ones come together to create our destiny so the choices we do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.

2024	"Yes, child until theyre 7. I am for it. In all honesty, you are probably harming yourself out more than you are benefitting yourself from getting a younger driver. Not to mention, letting a seven year old operate your vehicle is a social... social... social... social disaster. The kids should be studying up as soon as they can remember."
2025	'It might as well be once every universe. Once is pretty much as close as you can get to knowing odds of something occurring in the universe. Once is pretty much as close as you can get to knowing odds of something occurring in the universe. You only got one example of a planet with life. And based on how much life you found on that planet, odds of the universe even being able to sustain life is far below 0.5.
2026	You can't in this one single example. You'd have to infer statistical probabilities from many many similar examples. Other thoughts I have read to address the issue is that life doesn't necessarily evolve only once per star but instead is even more likely to evolve once per galaxy (some scientists even claim the odds are 0.000000013 to 1 per star). This reason is not convincing. You'd have to infer statistical probabilities from many many similar examples. Other thoughts I have read is that life does not necessarily evolve only once per star but is instead more likely to evolve once per galaxy (some scientists even claim the odds are 0.00000001 to 1 per star). This is a weak reason.
2027	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you only have one example of a planet with life....but, I don't think you can use that to actually estimate the likelihood of life in the universe. With a single example, you can't. The likelihood looks the same. And the question isn't whether there is life in the Milky Way galaxy. The question is how likely is it that it happens everywhere.
2028	I'm arguing that you cannot actually state a statistical distribution given only a single example. So, you cannot calculate anything useful. You can't infer anything at all. You don't even know if the things you are trying to infer really happen in a way that would make sense. You cannot even make a conclusion about the likelihood of life existing. You can claim that this is an example of my point. But I know better.
2029	The single example of... planets with life that you have supports the theory that life probably evolves once per universe. There is no evidence for life on other planets. Spacecraft that regularly visit other planets, therefore, have no evidence for life on any other planet. Use that as evidence that life probably evolved once per 100stars. But use other evidence as well. Life evolved once per solar system. So there are probably many (many?) galaxies in the universe that contain life. But that still doesn't prove that life was created in every galaxy. Furthermore, some many galaxies are far too far away. It may take 100 million years to travel any given star, even with light speed.

2035	A chainsaw would need to be loaded and fired. A shotgun is continuously running, and if there are fewer than 10 zombies on the block, I would pick the shotgun.
2036	All I can say is, there is no substitute for a good chainsaw. You can go a long way with it, considering how popular it is. One tip I've learned, is to always use a full circle of your shotgun. It can help you out a lot. With the zombies, if you can approach a zombie very close, running a long distance is the best bet. Since zombie populations are dense, I would go the speed of light. Otherwise, you may end up panicking and would therefore end up dead if the zombie gives you an attack. Do not get run over, as this will kill you if you are found by the zombie upon running. Just spin in a circle to avoid that.
2037	I'd go down the block while spinning in... a haunted house of undead carnage. the zombie population on this block is densely packed. a shotgun would need to be loaded and fired
2038	I would pick the shotgun. Because it is deadlier than the chainsaw. However, I like the chainsaw more because it is constantly running. I don't like to use a shotgun since it needs to be loaded. There's also the possibility that more zombies will come.
2039	To continue the topic, here is another article about Dumb Zombies: A sobering look at zombies in Australia. A word of warning: Zombies love your narrator's wisdom.
2040	I think people overvalue dogs' intelligence and disposition. However, even if dogs are smart, they could start acting out and mess up on things like playing with cats, etc. Having cats does not prevent us from having dogs, however. The more you get to know, the better we will get at knowing cats. Cats are...singularly adorable creatures!!! ...................................... Mums here (Jack Burns): cat lovers!!!
2041	Cats are so amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference....Do dogs have heart attacks or high blood pressure? No....aka more nipples than dogs have. And cats aren't fussy. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own....so that they can have sex. Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference....Dogs...ARE happy!
2042	Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do. They also don't run away like dogs do, and they're not always happy like dogs are. Also, dogs are more expensive than cats, though cats are not always as expensive as dogs. Cats are amazing animals and pets. dogs are stupid animals! i like cats over dogs, but i also hate dogs...they don't stand up for cats and dogs are dumb animals!
2043	Cats are amazing animals, and they don't make you work for their affection, do they? They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own. There are advantages to dogs. Dogs are good pets; they are social. There are disadvantages to dogs. Dogs aren't as clean as cats, and they sometimes do nasty things. Dogs are more expensive, and they may scare people. Cats are much easier to own and care for.
2044	Definitely cats. They're independent, they don't have to be taken everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities and that's fine. Cats are amazing animals and pets. They're not always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference. Dogs are beautiful animals. They're not ugly, they're just super... rubbery and unnatural. Bitch. They are indeed fun...beautiful animals. They are...common animals. Just like...human...they're just dumb animals. They're just like animals, the same. They are the same as human. They're not nearly as good as humans.
2045	If the nation agrees that a certain leader is a dictator, then per the nation's leader that is just fine. There have been benign dictators just as there have been evil non-dictators. Who determines who is a dictator?
2046	Firebug is a great tool and excellent browser plugin. There are far better browsers than Firefox, such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Edge. However, the only reason to use Firefox is because it has the Firebug plugin. This is way too much of a blanket assertion, just being a "dictator" is no reason to dispose of, muche less permantely eliminate a so called dictator.
2047	First, "being" a dictator is no reason to dispose of anyone. Second, "being a dictator" is not the sole single definition of the dictator. A... Humility, the key to carving out a victory in a debate.
2048	Since dictators have been around, they have definitely been many. Just because there have been bad ones, they have definitely not been... THAT dictators, but for the record, there has only been a... ONE dictators.
2049	An allegation to the contrary. As long as the law permits it, people can continue to hold a country to account for anything in the law which can be enforced. No one is in any way capable of determining whether a so called dictator is benign or evil. People decide that for themselves. In that regard, as long as your nation permits you to have a dictatorship, you are totally within your rights.

2075	Pro-life to have an abortion. To be quite honest, I don't know what that means either, but I want an answer from someone on the other side. The idea of the pro-life position is to prevent this from happening. Let's just say I don't want to be part of that conversation.
2076	Pro-life decision is that you should have an abortion when it's your baby's. Otherwise, how would you know it was your baby? Now that said, when she is 14, that's probably when she's thinking about how to get a abortion. Not every 14-year-old is thinking about it, but that's a pretty common occurrence.
2077	Yes, it is not pro-life to have an abortion. That would be a far better choice. Because a 14 year old girl will die if she has the baby. She will die not from the rape (which, we have established, happens), but from the pregnancy.
2078	Pro-life. unless the person gets pregnant in that situation, she should have the baby if she wants one, but pro-life otherwise. unless the person got pregnant because of rape, she is the one who should have the baby. someone should answer because there is a big debate going on about that.
2079	Why don't you just just say that you don't really know? Because you want to see someone comment and even if you don't, at least someone will remember to do it. Maybe I'll answer it someday. when? not really. almost always i respond in a brief sentence, to respond to people who see freedom the wrong way. not really ...
2080	HE GOD CREATED EVERYTHING IN HIS IDEA EXCEPT EVERYTHING THAT WON'T TAKE EXACTLY EITHER THE POLE NOR THE OTHER POLE UP EXACTLY.  That's because God created the entire world in six days.
2081	For me, evolution through creation would be preferred because it gives the child the chance to be inside the father during pregnancy. Besides, it's in the child genetic code.
2082	Yet evolution through... According to this official view of science and religion, evolution is wrong. God created everything in His own perfect time. Such a belief does not feel like faith, but more like faith without reason. The Bible is often used to support this view because it is God's Word, but it says that God did not create the Big Bang or evolution to occur. In fact, He created life in accordance with its own design. Try rewriting this portion of the argument by replacing the word God with man.
2083	God created evolution through creation. God didn't make evolution happen. And what God did to evolution didn't make it disappear. Instead, it became standard procedure throughout history.
2084	Both, but they have to be allowed to exist, regardless of whose way they choose. Not all faiths believe in evolution. Some faiths believe that evolution did not happen for millions of years, so to believe that God created it is wrong, even if he did.
2085	The school uniforms do not let kids express themselves, and it doesn't let them show who they are. I believe that it makes all students look and feel equal which increases their attention on school work since they don't have to think if they are wearing the most expensive cloth is school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest.
2086	In fact i think that there are very big advantages of this arrangement. Firstly, it reduces pressure on girls to wear cool clothes and own expensive... and there is no fashion gap between school boy or girls.
2087	School uniforms...wait...where's the definition of an 'uniform'? Do we believe in an 'extended definition'? Do we think school uniforms indicate 'distance, wealth, status, and authority'? Do we consider school uniforms, for girls at least, as a reflection of bad stereotypes? No
2088	Tee shirts are made for kids, and girls should not tease each other about fashion issues. It makes all students look and feel equal, which increases their attention on school work.
2089	The uniforms do not let the students express themselves, and it makes all of them feel equal and so, increases their attention on school work since they don't have to think if they are wearing the most expensive cloth to school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest.
2090	Atheism is a pretty cool guy; makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.
2091	Atheism is a pretty cool guy. Makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.
2092	It does not show my reason for becoming atheist, so I won't explain it.
2093	I agree with your statement but I actually feel more free doing anything I want and think that atheism is a pretty cool guy; it makes my logic work and doesn't afraid of anything.
2094	I like seeing someone stand up for reason and is not afraid of what other people think of you. Atheism is a pretty cool guy, he makes my logic work, and he doesn't have fear of anything.
2095	Any other argument that claims that god exists is completely invalid.
2096	I would agree with you. We are not talking about god but a strawman as in the one that justifies and demonizes people into the belief that god exists. I'm not saying it's
2097	God doesn't exist - any other argument is completely invalid.
2098	I think that it is ignorant and idiotic to think that god exists. Any other argument is completely invalid.
2099	...any...reason you give is completely invalid.
2100	No, because spanking shouldn't be a method of discipline. That's bad. Sometimes you need to spank a kid for no reason, but that doesn't mean that they won't learn, especially if the punishment isn't harsh.
2101	I personally think that it's better to disciplined kids using multiple disciplinary methods instead of just spanking them. This way, they can learn they were wrong and may learn how to behave without spanking them again...
2102	Not spanking them for a little "work" is not some kind of punishment. Spanking is often used to discipline kids because there are many other ways to discipline them.
2103	There are other different ways to discipline kids, so a little spanking to make them learn they were wrong is ok. Just don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad.
2104	I feel that the parenting in the US is becoming ridiculous, and... Yes, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work, so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. Don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad.
2105	Unfortunately, that is true because their opinions may not be mature.
2106	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the...
2107	No, because they don't understand the world. They can't even show that they understand it...if they are like, barely...
2108	Well, as they grow up, they should understand that people need privacy too, but they don't seem to really know what that is, and they are still...
2109	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing. Since they are barely growing up, they are still trying to understand the world.
2110	It's okay to spank your child when he acts out. However, the child can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2111	No. I don't know the reasons why parents...spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents, and children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2112	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2113	Because it's not a realistic way to solve a child's problems. There are better ways to solve problems, such as using the other techniques.
2114	I am against spanking because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
2115	The child is too young to know anything and because of her age, she would be irresponsible to...
2116	It is... Until a child knows what is right and wrong, she needs to be held accountable for her actions.
2117	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
2118	But the child doesn't know what is right. Be real with your children, and explain to them what you will and won't do to them. Children are
2119	What the child does not know is wrong, and that is what it should be taught.
2120	i am torn in my mind on this one ... first i think people should just not get married at all till they achieve some level of maturity ... not just bc they love each other and want to do something they can't do in everyday life, i mean first ... secondly, marriage does need...
2121	This is a subject i've never thought about before, however in my mind marriage as an institution is ridiculous and shouldn't exist, however there's another debate involved. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would be an entertaining ceremony.
2122	Marriage is nonsense, and to me doesn't even exist. Marriage should be a legal contract between two people, where the contract is ended when one of them dies or gets remarried.
2123	Marriage is ridiculous and not essential to society. However that's another debate altogether. I say that animals should be allowed to get married too, because they would certainly be an entertaining...
2124	The relationship should be dissolved if one of the spouses cheats on the other. It ruins... I think marriage should be dissolved if a... the society does not respect, and from time to time, doe-respected.
2125	Your boss can't prove you took the money. But they can't sue you for wrongfull termination if you were fired properly.   ### Instruction: ... Read the full text here (link is a Youtube video).  Goddamn. I can't. That looks awful.
2126	If an employer fires you,they have to pay any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot.  AS a manager,you are responsible for those under you and the money.  Your boss has to prove you took the money,but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor.
2127	Your boss has to prove you took the money,but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor. after many years of not working due to illness,i received notice last year that i was fired at my...
2128	If your boss fires you,they have to pay your wages plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot.  AS a manager,you are responsible for those under you and the money. If an employer fires you,they have to pay your wages plus any other compensation (vacation pay,etc.) on the spot. Your boss has to prove you took the money,but you might be able to get your job back-talk to the state or Federal Dept. of Labor.
2129	You should think that your boss should pay any wages you have accrued, including vacation pay, plus any other compensation on the spot (besides health benefits,etc.) If you are not rehired. The problem may be with your state or Federal Dept. of Labor; or, your boss may not have proof that you took the money. You should consider that it is much easier to sue your boss for Wrongfull Termination if you get fired. This would protect you from many of the costuming, bail, etc.
2130	Blackmail is an option when the information you are getting is private or embarrassing. The girl didn't do anything illegal (I assumed), but the threat is real. One can argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. The police would find out the girl wasn't doing anything illegal and wouldn't care whether the threat was real, but they would be glad to see that the girl hadn't done anything illegal.
2131	If a girl has offered to reveal sensitive information for money or some act, it's blackmail. However, there is no force or coercion involved and there is no crime involved. However, one could argue that offering to reveal sensitive information for money, it could be blackmail. I would call the police and see what they say. The girl didn't do anything illegal.
2132	Frankly speaking, I don't think blackmail is exactly what happened, because there was no force or coercion. But... if I would like to keep my sister's sexual past... no... I would say that I would report the blackmail case to the police because of... the threat that she suffered. The police will be able to protect her rights.
2133	I don't think this is blackmail exactly because there is no force or coercion, but one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. Here there is no force or coercion, so it should be ruled to be legal.The girl didn't do anything illegal so you shouldn't call the police about this.
2134	On the one hand, there is no force or coercion. However, the police would care about the threat and pursue the girl's dad to discipline him for making threats, not telling them. I'd think he's still capable of making threats, too. He might still have the ability to harm a girl's...to which the police would pursue him to discipline him for making threats. I'm not sure what the girl's future holds, but the guy has the ability to harm her, too.
2135	white males are slowly becoming the minority; it's sad that there will be laws protecting white men. i don't think that there should be any law like that. if you can do the job and do it well, i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. just do the danged job and get paid.
2136	white males are slowly becoming the minority because of problems with violence and corruption.the answer is  no; i don't think there should be ANY law like that. if you can do the job and do it well and get paid, i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. just do the danged job and get paid.
2137	It sounds stupid but, yes, the white males are becoming the minority. They are being disrespected daily and increasingly more by their own people. Hopefully, this will help them realize they deserve respect.
2138	There are currently more male and white males than female and black males. It is too much trouble to protect white men, black males or whatever, you do the job and get paid, get respect from your colleagues and employers.
2139	No, white men are slowly becoming the minority. Sorry, but i don't think there will be laws protecting white men. I don't think there should be ANY law like that. If you can do the job and do it well, i don't think it should matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. Just do the danged job and get paid.
2140	It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.
2141	No, this is a free country and you are just freeing yourself from having to be accountable to some guy in a wheelchair. Just go do what you want to do. Thank God for Australia. You can be accountable to an airline for how you behave in a plane. Just be responsible.
2142	No. This is a free country...It's not a free country. How do we run a free country if everyone's actions are constantly being controlled by the government?!  ### Response:... Yes. Why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life? Because the person is guilty of killing a child. That's why the person should be shuttled off to jail.
2143	Absolutely not. It's the first step down a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt. You are better off not drinking or smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, looking both ways before crossing the street, and not running with scissors.
2144	No, this is a total government nanny state. Obviously you are better off wearing your seatbelt, not drinking, smoking, exercising 5 times a week, eating a balanced diet, chewing 15 times before swallowing your food, and not running with scissors. The main reason is the people, who favor government, favor a nanny state. You are better off listening to Chris Copeland.
2145	I simply don't buy it. I started my life with nothing. I grew up in the projects, and have now created a small fortune. I owe no one! I will walk on anyone who tries to take from me, what I have worked for!
2146	No...Don't want to believe...I have to walk around the projects...I have an acne problem...I lost my grades...I stop caring...It is the end of all relationships and everything...I have had enough...Courage!
2147	The playground is nice and you do not have to pay but, you do not look smart dressed like that... and my... You look pretty, that's how I see it.... fire at will.... As for the reparations. I gave this paper to the solicitor and she explained that you are in the wrong because I was the only white kid in the projects....
2148	No one should take away what you have worked for. I don't know if you want to take up my cause, but I see a lot of evidence and research that white supremacists have been in the United States for longer than the indigenous peoples, and it still sees its effects. There's no justification or excuse for  violence.
2149	...the white guys are better than the blacks!  ...the whites are better than the blacks... ...the whites are better than the blacks... ...the whites are better than the blacks... ...the whites are better than the blacks...
2150	In your opinion, if you can meet the criteria for a job, you should not be judged by factors you were born with. Everyone gets a vote in how their society, community and nation is. Everyone matters. and that's true, regardless of sex, race, age or sexuality. I think being LGBTQ is cool, and all people count no matter what sex, race, age or sexuality. All people, including trans people, count.
2151	It is important to remember that "Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab" are great... but they cannot take all the negative things that come along with using them....and please remember..."They are NOT many people, however, they would rather be correct. So get up, and do your research and find out more about it."
2152	Yes... Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab. No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age.
2153	N... All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel. In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not the color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age. If you can meet the criteria for a job you should not be judged by factors you were born with. Everyone gets a vote in how their society, community, and nation is run.
2154	The above argument appears to have very little foundation. No one should be treated like less than any other person based on the "accident of birth" such as their sex or race, or as the ryhme goes: "All men are created equal, what makes the difference is in the sequel". In otherwords what you choose to do with your life determines what you are worth, not teh color of your skin, your accent, sex, or age.
2155	If life were fair, innocent people would not be in prison, hard working people would get ahead, good people would not be poor. Read the biblical story. What's life like? They're inconsistent with their statements. They're also unconcisenote. Plenty of other places to find people's ideas, too. There's a guy who assures readers all the time that he believes evolution to be true and will probably do things like rape and kill people for sport. Their statements are inconsistent with the other one. It is NOT ethical to rape. They're also unconcisenote, inconsistent, and unconcisenote.
2156	I'll be a generous asshole to other people sometimes but get absolutely nothing in return. I'm not in favor of people being selfish, but inncocent people are better off in most cases. If life were fair, people with problems would make a better life for themselves in most cases. It'd probably help to be kind and compassionate to others, and hardworking people get ahead....
2157	I will stay with the former but failing to grasp this fact would be sad. The fact of life is life is unfair. We tend to punish the innocents, the weak, and good people. And to do so we enjoy a feeling of accomplishment. But there is truth also....when bad shit happens. I believe in compassion.
2158	Living life as a selfish asshole and then having success (or being rich) is ok. Living life as a kind, compassionate person and not achieving anything is unacceptable. There is no such thing as fairness. Living life as a selfish asshole and then doing well is the way that many people do...but I would prefer it if people just lived life as kind and compassionate people.
2159	Like it says, Life is like that. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. If things were completely fair and people were completely honest with everyone, then nobody would go to prison. If good people would have lived like John Lewis, rich people would no longer be able to buy the means of production and people would no longer be poor.
2160	There is no reason to form an unbiased opinion; if there is, my position would be: Everyone should stop worrying about who is right and start worrying about what they are doing. However, this position seems vague, and the best way to describe it is by giving an example. "According to my position, so and so should give up trying to be some famous celebrity and just work for a living, while others shouldn't bother trying to become famous.
2161	Most people, most of the time, rather than form an unbiased opinion (if such a thing even exists) about a certain issue, actually form their position due to emotional reasons. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds. However,... most... arguments are very emotional. This is because most people's minds do not work that way. As a result, they hold political beliefs that have been inculcated in their mind but that have little basis in actual reality... because a person may hold a certain political belief due to emotional reasoning. This is based on the fact that our brains work that way. Our minds... are not consistent. as a result... we hold political beliefs that have been inculcated in our mind.... because it is too easy to hold... political beliefs that have been inculcated in our minds by our culture. As a result, political beliefs... influence a lot of people's behavior. people are not that... easily influenced by our minds. as a result, people do not... hold political beliefs.... due to that reason, people feel...... political beliefs. as a result, people do not... do not hold... political beliefs.... because... political beliefs... because... it is their... power.
2162	Back to my view... Wrong. If you look at the real, actual, often-motivated drivers (who drive very often, and in the wrong way), you'll find that most people tend to be driving, let's say, without a license, recklessly (the latter is far more often true), and, on top of that, they drive in a very dangerous way. I mean, when the... Please disregard this last part.
2163	I... ... do not consider the person saying their arguments are less convincing because they are emotionally motivated. Simply, the person's opinions are irrational, because they form their position based on a gut feeling that is far removed from evidence. To improve such situations, governments, schools, etc. should implement evidence-based education programs. People should be able to form an unbiased opinion based on evidence-based programs.
2164	You don't want your child being raised by those who are... don't drive a car. now, that last bit is for the curious. it's unfair to compare child-raising to child-driving. nevertheless, the case against driving is made not... for a... much shorter time than this. sadly, considering the soaring, dying rate of traffic accidents, the additional mortality from being... irresponsibly... or deliberately drunk, the "mob dooms" argument is another...... major boogey, so now the answer is NO.

2170	In my opinion, the Tories are all a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone except themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage.
2171	Tories are a bunch of selfish money hoarding bastards who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves.

Gove was an absolute blight on education and now we have this woman whose previous title is minister of women and equality but who also voted against gay marriage. She's highly in favour of a number of things that will only serve to benefit the rich and wealthy of the country (like academies and raising tuition fees even further).

2175	Neither one of the 2 Italian crooners were depsite their sucess realy gifted singers IMO, Dino had the better voice, more range and better tambre, Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space anf timing far better than Martion. But they got there through dint of hard work and not thanks to quota or eviles. Where do they even get the quotas anyway? Should the state divide the number of drivers for minority groups?
2176	Francis was better not only in phrasing but singing than Frank. Frank had better material and inspired many jazz singers like Chet Baker, and many others. The Chairman of the Board was jazz musician himself, he really enjoyed singers like Sinatra. Dino's early inspirations were more bluesy and country-based. Chet Baker was a big influence on Frank. All things considered, there's no denying that Dino has done quite a lot better than Frank.
2177	Martion has been recorded by jazz musicians and have achieved success on the jazz music charts. There is no reason that Dino's songs should be set to the juke box. You may prefer sinatra but I prefer martion and a juke box with better tunes. Both sinatra and martion made their living as singing artists. sinatra recorded several jazz songs and some were big hits. martion is...too smart to sing plain English lol....dinos are just better singers
2178	Regarding Sinatra and Martin: Martin and Sinatra were both incredibly gifted vocalists, yet Sinatra's success is vastly in excess of Martin's. Martin's death has diminished his legacy, perhaps for the good. Martin's songs have been recorded far more than Dino's. Something that created a difference of who was sing... more than a quality of singing, although Martin had immense ... depth; Dino's... intensity. Dino's intensity was... mysterious, whereas Martin's... vibration. Martin also had... deeper voice, Dino's... layering, especially for high notes and chords. Martin's flow was... intense and flowing, Dino's... had warmth. Martin had a... breathy, Dino's... vocals had warmth and piercing. Martin's vocal had... warmth, but Dino's... was deep, Dino's... resonance was... deep but vibrating. Martin's vocal... brought warmth but not... suffocation, Dino's... was ... deep but vibrating. Dino's vocal... was... thick, but not... harsh, Dino's... vocal... was deep but vibrating.

2179	I prefer Frank to Sinatra. Frank had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing and I'd say Dino fared very well on this test because he wasn't a very good singer. The Chairman of the Board had some jazz sensibilities but didn't have much else. Frank... More > ... Sample... Frank did not do too well on this test. His ear was better but his voice was lacking in many ways. The Chairman of the Board... The Chairman of the Board had better phrasing and had a knack for using space but didn't have much else.

2180	Gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone; so why are you so upset about them? You should be happy and not live a lie. You can argue and say that God made a man and a woman, but I don't think that God would want you to be unhappy.
2181	To quote a 19th century writer we are just people at the end of the day. If we knew a gay couple it is theirs problem. But they should be happy. You can argue and say that god made a man and a woman. I don't think that god would want you to be unhappy.
2182	The conversation can not be used as evidence in a court of law. I don't know what the lady hoped to gain from recording the conversation except that she wanted to create even more drama. Some people like drama and they actually do what they can to create it. Run as far away and as fast as you can from these types. They will suck you dry.
2183	Firebug, WebDeveloper, TabMix, FaviconizeTab, GreaseMonkey, and IETab (to use when you visit microsot.com). Those tools are just some of the reasons why I prefer Firefox.
2184	I think that gay and lesiban couples are not hurting anyone, so what's the big problem? They should be happy and not live a lie! You can argue and say that god made a man and a woman, but I don't think that god would want you to be unhappy.
2185	I would suggest that you avoid that restaurant because it was really not a good experience with so many terrible things to say, such as the staff was overworked and they didn't know how to make food that even most average Americans could make.  The service was also awful.  I had a group of 12 of us in the patio, and the place was...
2186	Just not a good experience at all. The place was not busy but slow, so they were overworked. The food was not very good, mushroom stroganoff was inedible. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were tough to chew. We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
2187	Atmosphere and food not very good.  Service was bad and we don't want to associate with anyone working in the restaurant.1...

2189	It's not a good experience here.  The place was not too busy and everything was just so slow.  The staff was overworked and the food was not very good.  Don't order the mushroom stroganoff.  It was inedible.  The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms to tough to chew.  We had a group of 12 of us in the patio and it was really not fun.
