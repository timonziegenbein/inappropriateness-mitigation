5	I believe that books are better than TV, as they are more engaging and can provide a deeper understanding of a subject matter. You can transport yourself to other worlds and learn through educational content.
6	I think books are better than TV, since they can transport you to a whole new world and provide educational value.
7	I believe that books are better than TV because they are more immersive and can take you to a whole new world. Additionally, reading is more educational and can offer greater insight than watching television.

9	I believe that books are better than TV, as they provide a deeper learning experience and can take you to different worlds. This is more beneficial than just passively watching TV.
10	Books can enrich the soul and provide a deep sense of satisfaction and understanding. They encourage readers to question the world and consider new perspectives. Reading can transport the mind to distant and imaginative places and allow us to experience emotions together with the characters. Books have the power to shape the way we think, act, and feel. In contrast, television often serves as a sedative and has the potential to distort the values of its viewers. Fahrenheit 451, The Night Circus, The Secret Garden, and Inkheart are all excellent examples of the transformative power of literature.
11	Books enlighten the soul. They stimulate the mind and evoke deep thoughts. They take the reader on incredible journeys and offer a fresh perspective on life. Television is comparable to a drug and can be as addictive as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... do I need to explain further?
12	Books can enrich the soul. They can expand a reader's perspective and give them a sense of relativity. Through stories, characters, and imaginative worlds, books allow readers to explore new ideas and emotions. Conversely, television can be a seductive and addictive distraction that hinders reading and other productive pursuits. Fahrenheit 451, The Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain how books can be an invaluable resource?
13	Books can enrich the soul. They can open the mind to new ideas and allow readers to explore diverse places, from paradises to the kitchen sink. They can change a person's perspective and give them a sense of relativity. Television is comparable to an addictive drug and can be just as damaging as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, The Night Circus, The Secret Garden, and Inkheart are just a few examples of the powerful impact that books can have.
14	Books enlighten the soul and allow one to explore new worlds, both fantastic and mundane. They stimulate the mind, taking readers on a journey of discovery and introspection. Television can be as addictive as nicotine and its effects are just as damaging to the brain, so reading is a healthier and more productive alternative. Classics like Fahrenheit 451, The Night Circus, The Secret Garden, and Inkheart are proof that books have the power to shape our lives, hearts, and minds in innumerable ways.

20	I believe that I can turn out successful even without a father or any fatherly guidance. My own experience of the first thirteen years of my life, where I did not have a father, has demonstrated this. I am proud of my achievements thus far and do not consider myself to be lacking in any way due to my fatherless upbringing.
21	I would rather be completely fatherless than have a lousy father. I recognize that this is a personal choice and not a universally applicable one. I turned out great despite the lack of paternal guidance in my early years. This is proof that fatherlessness does not necessarily equate to negative outcomes. Nevertheless, I still prefer the security of being completely fatherless rather than having a lousy father.
22	I consider myself fortunate to have been raised without a father, as I believe that the fatherly influence during childhood is essential but can also be detrimental. Despite this, I have grown up to be successful and feel that I have turned out well. My experiences of the first thirteen years of my life are evidence of this. I consider myself to be better off for not having a father, and would not change my upbringing.
23	Honestly, I'd rather be raised without a father, than to have one that is lousy. After all, I have been successful in life despite the lack of a fatherly influence in my formative years. Take myself for example; I grew up the first 13 years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and I have still turned out great (Self-opinion). Therefore, I think it is better to have no father at all, than to have an inadequate one.
24	I believe that one can grow up without a father and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and I turned out great (Self-opinion). Contrasted to having a lousy father who would influence and shape me into half a man, I would prefer the option of being fatherless.

30	I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has its own intricate design, which is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer, do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came about by a mere chance or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.

45	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. Thus, having any father figure is better than none, (assuming he is not abusive in any way) and people can and do change. Who says that he will be lousy forever? There are family therapy sessions that can help to repair relationships and build healthy coping skills.

48	Scientific evidence shows that having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. So, a bad father is better than none (assuming he is not abusive), as people can change over time. Furthermore, couples can attend family therapy sessions to help work through any issues and negative patterns.
49	There is scientific evidence that suggests that having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically, mentally, and emotionally. So, in some cases, a poor father is better than none (assuming that he is not abusive in any way). Furthermore, people can and do change. Therapy sessions can help individuals overcome difficult issues and become better parents. Thus, it is possible for a lousy father to become better over time.
50	I believe people have the potential to improve themselves and become better individuals. I'd much rather have the hope that my father could have been a good father, rather than knowing that I will never meet him. I would be too curious as to what kind of father he could have been.

67	I would report the person to the police and turn them in, since I don't believe killing someone is right and I wouldn't want to sleep next to a murderer.

69	I would turn them in because it is not right to take a life and get away with it. Additionally, I would not want to be in proximity to a murderer, either physically or morally.
70	The government has every right to regulate what a woman does with her body.  1) Prostitution is not legal in most states, nor is the use of illicit drugs.  2) Murder, theft, and public nudity are all prohibited.  3) There are laws against certain types of dangerous activities, such as climbing a building without a safety harness.  4) Men and women are held to the same standards when it comes to body autonomy.  5) Similarly, laws exist prohibiting public exposure of private parts.  Therefore, the government has every right to regulate what a woman does with her body.
71	The government has every right to dictate what a woman can and cannot do with her body.  1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states.  2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her body.  3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others.  4) a woman cannot use her body to steal.  5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public.  There are many others. Men can also not do these things.  The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.

75	I am pro-life, and I believe that an unborn baby is a living human being, with rights and dignity that should be respected. To those who are pro-choice, I have a question: How do you know that the baby in the mother's womb is not a living human being?

80	I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Those who oppose it tend to be biased against homosexuality in general. If two people - whether they be two men or two women - are in a loving relationship, why should they not be allowed to get married if they want to be with each other forever?
81	I believe that gay marriage should be allowed. Most who are against it tend to be prejudiced against homosexuality in general. If two people, regardless of their gender, are happy together, love each other, and want to spend the rest of their lives together, why should they not be allowed to get married?
82	I believe that same-sex marriage should be legally recognized and accepted. The opposition to it tends to be based on prejudice, as those who are against it often do not accept homosexuality in general. If two people, regardless of their gender, love each other and want to spend their lives together, why should they not be allowed to get married?
83	I believe gay marriage should be legally recognized, as it is a matter of individual autonomy and love. Those who oppose it often do so due to prejudice, since same-sex couples should not be denied the right to spend their lives together. If two men or two women love each other and want to commit to a lasting relationship, then why should they not be allowed to get married?
84	I believe that same-sex couples should have the right to marry. Many people who are opposed to gay marriage are simply prejudiced against homosexuality. If two men or two women are in a loving relationship and want to commit to one another, why should they not be allowed to get married?
85	As someone who is not a lawyer, I suggest you consult one regarding the following statement. The full legal text states: “You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.”  Determining what is “primarily intended” for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
86	I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one if you want to be sure. The license text states: "You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works."

87	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably consult one about this. However, the full legal text states that "you may not exercise any of the rights granted to you in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation". It is unclear what is meant by "primarily", but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), then you may be acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
88	I am not a lawyer, and you should probably consult one about this. However, my understanding of the license is that you may not exercise any of the rights granted to you in Section 3 for the purpose of earning money. The license states that the exchange of the work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, as long as there is no payment involved. Determining what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
89	I am not a lawyer, and you should consult one about this. The license states that you may not exercise the rights granted to you in Section 3 "in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation." It is up to the court to determine what is "primarily intended" for commercial purposes. If you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (including non-cash costs such as your time), you should be safe. Making money is not completely forbidden by the license, but using the work primarily to do so.
90	No, that is part of the beauty of the United States - you have the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions without having to rely on the government. If your brother had chosen to contribute to society instead of committing crimes, he might not be in this situation. Jail does not provide any benefits, so he should take responsibility for his actions.
91	I don't think that's a good idea. That's the beauty of the U.S., where you don't have to have healthcare. Why should it change if someone has to go to jail while the rest of the public is paying their hard-earned money into taxes? Your brother is in jail for a reason, maybe if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in this situation. Jail has no company benefits.
92	I believe that healthcare is a basic human right, not a privilege reserved for a few. It is unacceptable that a person should be denied healthcare simply because they have committed a crime. That said, I also believe that those who have broken the law should be held accountable and face the consequences of their actions. However, I do not think that incarceration is the appropriate solution in all cases, and I support alternative forms of punishment, such as community service and rehabilitation, where appropriate.
93	That's a great aspect of the USA – nobody is required to have healthcare. If your brother was imprisoned, it's likely due to his decisions, not because he hasn't contributed to society. Prisoners don't receive any benefits from their employer, so he won't get any assistance from the government either. Everyone should take responsibility for their own actions and make sure they contribute positively to society.  In this way, we can ensure justice is served and ensure a better future for all.
94	No. That is the beauty of the USA, where you have the freedom to choose and bear the consequences of your decisions. Why would it change if you had to go to jail while the rest of the public pays their hard earned money into taxes? Your brother is in jail for a reason, perhaps if he had contributed to society instead of committing crimes he would not be in this situation. Jail has no job security.
95	I feel that this policy goes against the values of freedom and privacy that define the United States. How about we all wear GPS anklets so the government can track our movements, oops, that's right – we all already have them in the form of cell phones. This policy claims to be for public safety, but I'm skeptical of its usefulness in preventing anything. At best, it serves to intrude upon the private lives of citizens without cause. In my opinion, this is a clear violation of personal liberties. Give me a break – if I wanted to commit an act of violence, I wouldn't be making phone calls to plan it anyway.
96	I believe this policy to be a violation of personal freedoms and in direct opposition to American values. How about everyone wears a GPS ankle bracelet so the government knows where we are at all times? And forget about cell phones, I almost forgot about that. But this is justified in the name of public safety, right? That's a bit of a stretch since I doubt anyone is actually going to blow anything up by making phone calls. Give me a break.
97	I find the government's proposed surveillance measures to be anti-American and contrary to our freedoms and liberties. How about everyone wears a GPS system on their bodies so the government can track their every move? Actually, cell phones already have built-in GPS tracking capabilities, so the government would have access to our locations without even needing to implement any further measures. Additionally, the government is claiming this is all in the name of public safety, but I doubt that is true, since I don't think I'm the only one who would be wary of discussing sensitive matters on the phone for fear of being monitored. It seems to me like a violation of personal privacy and civil rights.
98	I feel that this policy is utterly antithetical to American values. How about everyone wears a GPS tracking device on their leg so the government knows exactly where everyone is, oops that's right cell phones-- I almost forgot. In addition, the government claims this is for public safety, but I'm still not convinced given the potential for invasion of privacy. Come on, really? If I wanted to blow something up, I wouldn't make any phone calls to plan it anyway. This is ridiculous.
99	I oppose this policy because it goes against the core values of what America stands for. How about everyone wears a GPS tracking device on their body so the government knows their exact location at all times? Oh, that's right, cell phones – I almost forgot! Besides this, the government is claiming it's for public safety, but I don't feel very secure if I know the government is listening in on my phone calls. That's ridiculous – if I wanted to blow something up, I wouldn't need to make a phone call to do it anyway.
100	Do you mean Ernesto "Che" Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary leader?   Well, let's quote Che. He once wrote, "You can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea." He was reflecting on how the concept of freedom from oppression is contagious and will spread regardless of any attempts to stamp it out.   Even today, there is still oppression in the world. There is still a desire for liberation from it. So why not? The same basic conditions that existed when Che was alive still exist today.

105	In one sense, you bring up an interesting point. Let me challenge you with a broader concept...  ...do our laws reflect our morality...or does morality stem from the laws we make each other abide by?  In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them.  Think on that bit as you ponder your own question.  In my own personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy. In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being. And each new majority will bring its own set of values.
106	In one sense, your argument is thought-provoking. Let me challenge you with a broader concept... Do our laws reflect our morality, or does morality stem from the laws that we make each other abide by?  In their written series on civilization, Will and Ariel Durant argued in the first book, "Our Oriental Heritage," that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them.  Consider this as you ponder your own question.  In my own personal opinion, I believe that faith can and should inform public policy. In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being. And each new majority will bring its own set of values.

110	There are many forms of abuse, including mental, physical, and emotional neglect. Perhaps she just doesn't want you around anymore, or it could be payback for something you did. A restraining order can be beneficial in providing peace of mind: if the abuser is kept away, then the victim does not have to be reminded of the hurt the abuser has caused. It can provide a safe area for the heart to take a break and get some much-needed respite.
111	There are many forms of abuse - mental, physical, emotional, and neglect. It is possible that the victim simply does not want to be around the abuser any more, or that they are seeking payback for something the abuser did. Getting a restraining order can provide a sense of security and peace of mind - knowing that the abuser is forbidden from coming within a certain distance of the victim. This may give the victim some respite from the stress and anxiety of the abuse. Additionally, it may provide a safe area for the heart to rest easier, as the victim does not have to constantly worry about being in contact with the abuser.
112	There are many different kinds of abuse, including physical, mental, and emotional. It is possible that the person you care about no longer wants to be around you. Perhaps they are seeking payback for something you have done, or are still unable to get over it. A restraining order can provide peace of mind and give the heart some respite. If you don't have to see the person anymore, you won't have to be reminded of their lies, cheating, and disappointments.

114	There are many types of abuse - mental, physical, emotional, and neglect. It is possible that the victim simply does not want to be around the abuser anymore, or that they are seeking a restraining order out of fear of further harm. The order could provide a sense of security, allowing the victim to have a "safe area" for their heart to heal. The victim may view the order as a way to be free from reminders of the abuse and to have a measure of protection from further harm.
115	I can't see how the adversarial judicial system helps to get at the truth. It seems more about how well an argument is presented than the facts of a case.  The way that both sides draw conclusions, and attempt to manipulate the jury with emotional language into believing them seems deceptive. In addition, the jury, who are mostly untrained (in terms of weighing evidence) individuals, are asked to decide which argument is better, which seems to be a poor method of getting at the truth.  What are the arguments in favor of this system?

120	I apologize if my ramblings cause you to exceed the 500 word limit. The race car is superior to the dirt bike in most instances, especially on maps like the beach, the cave, and Highway. On Rollercoaster, it's tailor made for those levels. With the race car, you can maintain forward momentum due to its downforce, while the bike loses momentum easily and makes you do back flips, making it difficult to get back up without a run up. CMV!
121	Forgive any rambling; I will make sure to hit the 500-word limit. The race car is clearly the superior vehicle in this game. On maps like the beach and the cave, the downforce keeps you grounded on the big hills and keeps you in the groove. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it; it was tailor-made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. The downside to the dirt bike is that it's so flippy; if you get onto a hill and lose momentum, you will do a back flip and slip backwards, making it difficult to get back up without a run-up. With the race car, once you gain forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!

I have made all of my high scores with the race car, with the exception of the moon, where the dirt bike is amazing for racking up coins with flips and crazy air time. The downside of the bike is that it is too easy to lose momentum on hills, resulting in a back flip and a slip backwards that is hard to recover from without a run-up. CMV!
123	I believe that the race car is the superior vehicle in this game. On maps like the beach and the cave, the downforce keeps you grounded on the big hills and prevents you from slipping backwards. On Highway and Rollercoaster, it's tailor made for these types of levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. The dirt bike is great on the moon, but it has its downsides: it's so flippy, so you need to be really careful. If you lose momentum going up a hill, you end up doing a backflip and sliding backwards, which is difficult to recover from without a run-up. In comparison, the race car offers more stability and predictability. CMV!
124	To be honest, I'm going to make sure I hit the 500 word limit. Except for the moon, where the dirt bike is amazing for racking up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle.

125	First of all, very first of all, people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes, is the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30 minutes?  I can see that many people in reddit disagree with this, however, and I want to know why, so I can form a balanced opinion. So CMV!

128	Firstly, it is clear that people are highly motivated by greed. We will scrimp and save wherever possible in order to accumulate more wealth. This is evident from the fact that the budget of the US government is estimated to be $8B according to Forbes. Furthermore, if Congress were to deem the organization to be useless, or if they felt that they could get away with it, then they would immediately remove it. This clearly demonstrates that the organization is serving some sort of purpose, otherwise it would not still exist.  Secondly, the organization is adapting and changing over time. Every year, new security measures are implemented, which might be annoying at times but are likely necessary to keep the country safe. This is especially true given the ever-evolving security threat environment. So while it may be inconvenient to stand in line for 30 minutes and to throw away 500ml of water, these measures might very well have saved lives.  I can understand why many people disagree with the organization, but I am interested in hearing why so that I can form a balanced opinion. That is why I am using the comments section of reddit to ask this question.

130	I believe that a person's first love is the strongest, and each subsequent love will become weaker in comparison. This is somewhat like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time, where the individual is ultimately searching for an experience that can match or surpass the intensity of their first love. As a result, my view of love is shaped by the notion that once the veil is lifted and naive beliefs are lost, an individual is more likely to become cynical and realize how hurtful love can be. This is especially true on reddit, where I have seen much evidence of how love can end in heartbreak.
131	I believe that a man's strongest love is the one he experiences first, with subsequent loves becoming weaker. This is similar to the experience of chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time - the intensity of the experience never quite matches up to the first time. This experience is what causes us to become more guarded and realistic about love. It is only through this experience that we can see just how hurtful and difficult love can be, which is why reddit has changed my views.
132	I believe that a person's first love is the strongest, and each subsequent love will be weaker, like chasing the dragon after taking a drug for the first time. After experiencing the joy of falling in love, it is easier to become more cynical and see how hurtful love can be. This is especially true after experiencing heartbreak. These real-life experiences help to reveal the complexity of love and reduce the idealistic beliefs one may have had before. Reddit confirmed my view.
133	I believe that a person's first love is usually the strongest, and that each subsequent love is weaker, with the intensity of the first love hard to match. This is somewhat like the "chasing the dragon" phenomenon, where people who try drugs for the first time might find that the high they experience the first time is not matched by subsequent experiences. Additionally, my opinion is based on the idea that, after experiencing the intense emotions and heartbreak of love, people become more cynical and realistic about it. This is reflected in the negative sentiment on reddit threads about love.
134	I believe that a person's first love is the strongest and most passionate. Every subsequent love is weaker, similar to how a person chases the high they experienced from their first love. As a result, the veil of naivete is lifted and one begins to recognize the potential hurt that love can bring. This realization is often brought on by reddit.
135	Yes, it could recover if the government stops its interference and bailout measures. Such interference only worsened the already temporary market downturn and created the devastating Great Depression. Furthermore, some of the labor laws enacted to help fix the economy were detrimental to our competitiveness. It would be beneficial if lawmakers were required to take relevant history classes in high school.
136	Yes, it will recover - provided the government stops its interference and bailout measures. It's actions such as these that turned a potentially temporary market downturn into a massive and dreadful "Great Depression"... and as part of the "measures" then implemented were some of the labor laws that are still hindering our ability to be competitive. I wish lawmakers had to take some relevant history while in high school.
137	Yes, it WILL recover - PROVIDED the government stops its meddling and "bailing out" measures. It's actions such as these that turned the potential temporary market drop into a huge and horrible "Great Depression" and, as part of the measures implemented, unions were strengthened, restricting our competitiveness. I wish lawmakers had to take relevant history classes while in high school.
138	Yes, it will recover - provided the government stops its meddling and bailout measures. Such policies only made a temporary market downturn into a huge and horrible "Great Depression" that continues to cripple our ability to be competitive. I wish lawmakers had to take some relevant history lessons while in high school.
139	Yes, it will recover if the government stops its interference and "bailout" measures. Such actions have caused the already temporary market downturn to become much worse, resulting in the horrid "Great Depression" and the crippling of our competitiveness through unfavorable union laws. I wish lawmakers had to take relevant economic history classes in high school.

Back in the 60s, before Taco Bell became part of another multi-national corporation, they were actually good. In our high school days, we would go there to cure the munchies; tacos were 5 for a buck back then.

145	Yes, around 18 have been created in the last few weeks, which is too much for any single day. A filter should be applied to prevent this from happening. Additionally, there should be a maximum number of debates allowed in a day, with the exception of special cases, such as large debates or debates that have been endorsed by moderators. This will give debaters a chance to gain more exposure for their debates and readers a chance to read and respond to them. Furthermore, this will ensure that debaters do not have to constantly repost their debates in order to gain more attention.
146	I agree. Approximately 18 debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The average number of debates created in the past few weeks is around 8 to 9 per day.  To give people a fair chance to read and respond to the current debates, there should be a limit on the number of debates that can be created in a single day, perhaps using a filtered bucket or something similar.
147	I agree. Yesterday (the 12th) there were nearly 20 debates posted. The average number of debates posted per day in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9.  To give people a fair chance to read and respond to the current debates, I suggest that there should be a limit on how many can be posted in a day, perhaps using a filtered bucket or something similar. This would give everyone an equal opportunity to be seen.  Furthermore, I believe that this issue of too many debates being posted at once is a problem, as it leads to debates falling down the list and thereby less people reading and responding to them. It's only fair that all debaters get the attention they deserve and this issue should be addressed.
148	Yes, almost 20 debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The average number of new debates created in the past few weeks is around 8-9 per day. To give people a fair chance to read and respond to the current debates, I suggest implementing a maximum number of debates that can be posted in a single day, perhaps using a filtering system to selectively choose which debates are displayed. This would ensure that new debates don't get lost in the mix, and give people a better chance to meaningfully engage with the current ones.
149	Yes, almost 20 debates were created yesterday (the 12th). The average number of debates created per day in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9. To give people a better chance to read and respond to these debates, there should be a maximum of debates that can be posted in a single day, perhaps via a filtered bucket or some similar system. Too many debaters are investing time and effort into their current open debates, only to watch them slowly fall down the list and receive less attention. This needs to be addressed.
150	Since this place was close to my home and it had good reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. I ordered the veal sandwich and checked out their baked goods.  Veal Sandwich - 3 stars. The veal wasn't quite tender enough to bite through, but it was cooked well. I added provolone and onions which were decent, but the onions were sliced quite thick. The tomato sauce was a bit liquidy, which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich a bit soggy compared to tasty.  Baked Goods - 3 stars. I can't comment on the taste since I only checked it out, but a few of the items looked quite familiar from other bakeries, which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also, there was a lot of condensation build-up in one of the cake/cookie fridges, which made the food look unappetizing. The only items that looked worth trying were the lemon meringue and cannolis.   Final thoughts - I was hoping for better than average, but I got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.

157	From a design perspective, Firefox is the clear winner in the Pretty Browser battle. Its extensive range of beautiful skins and high degree of Toolbar and UI customization make it an attractive and practical choice.

174	Books offer significant improvement to grammar and spelling skills, as well as providing more creative inspiration. With TV, everything is presented to you. With books, you are able to imagine the characters' looks and the setting with your own little creativity. Furthermore, books can be taken anywhere and everywhere without disrupting anyone.
175	It is clearly wrong to view pornography. It can lead to an unhealthy addiction, distorting one's view of real sex and romance. Pornography focuses on pleasure, but true sex is always about love and affection as well. It has been known to inspire criminal acts that abuse the rights and innocence of others.
176	Pornography is most definitely wrong. It can lead to serious addictions in some people, which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt, lust, and even more dangerous compulsions. Pornography distorts the healthy image of real sex by focusing solely on pleasure, when sex is actually an expression of love and affection as well. Additionally, pornography has been linked to numerous heinous crimes which abuse the rights and innocence of victims.
177	Pornography is definitely wrong. Pornography can be an addiction for some people, leading to guilt and lust. An addiction to pornography can give an unhealthy view of real sex, promoting the idea that sex is only about pleasure, when in reality it is also about love and affection. Pornography has also been linked to numerous real-life crimes which abuse the rights and virginity of others.
178	It is wrong to view pornography as it can lead to many harmful effects. Pornography can be addictive and can cause guilt and lust, warping the viewer's understanding of real sex. It also promotes an overly-simplistic view of sex, neglecting the importance of love and affection in the process. Furthermore, porn has been linked to numerous crimes which abuse the rights and virginity of victims.
179	Pornography is definitely not ideal. Porn is like an addiction for some people that is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to pornography distorts the fact that sex is about both pleasure and love, instead promoting an overly-simplified view of sex that focuses solely on pleasure. Additionally, it has been linked to numerous crimes that abuse the rights and virginity of many people. Thus, it is clear that pornography is not a healthy expression of sexuality.
180	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, then hey who's to stop you! For the record, yeah it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.
181	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, then you are free to make your own decisions. For the record, yes it is wrong. Unfortunately, it is impossible to reason with someone who does not share the same beliefs, which is why my first point is that it is wrong.

Hence, my first point is that you cannot win an argument if both parties have different beliefs.
183	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, than hey who's to stop you! For the record, it is wrong to act against Christian beliefs, if you and the other individual both adhere to different beliefs. Thus, my first point is that it is impossible to reasonably argue the issue.

195	Whoever argued that pornography degrades women is misguided. #1 Pornographic actors and actresses are compensated for their work. #2 These individuals have chosen to participate in pornographic material of their own free will. #3 Not all women involved in pornography are coerced or forced into the industry. #4 Without sex and pornography, you may not have been born. Sex is an integral part of life. =)

Sex is a vital part of life. =)
197	Those who believe that pornography degrades women are wrong. #1 Pornographic actors are compensated for their work, and they can decide for themselves if the compensation is worth it. #2 These women may have chosen pornography as a job, but they are still humans, and humans should be respected regardless of their profession. #3 Not all women enjoy being degraded in such a manner, and not all women are comfortable with the idea of being a pornographic actress. #4 Without sex and pornography, you may not have been born. Life = Sex.
198	Whoever said that pornography degrades women is incorrect. #1 Pornographic actors and actresses are often compensated well for their work. #2 They have chosen to enter the pornography industry and make their living from it. #3 Some women actually enjoy the work that they do in the adult film industry. #4 Without sex and pornography, you may not have been born.

200	Viewing pornography is not wrong, as long as it is done in a consensual manner and with respect for the individuals who chose to participate. It is understandably degrading to the women who are featured in the content.
201	Porn isn't wrong, so long as it's consensual and discreet. It can be degrading to the women who choose to participate in it, though.
202	Porn isn't wrong, as long as it is consensual and between adults. It can be degrading to the women who choose to participate, however, so it should only be viewed behind closed doors and never be a secret from your partner.
203	Porn may not be wrong, as long as it is consensual and disclosed to one's partner. It can be demeaning to the women who choose to participate in pornography, however, and couples should be aware of this before engaging in it.
204	Pornography may not be universally right, but it's not inherently wrong as long as it's consensual and no one is being deceived. The degradation of women is an issue, but it's up to the individuals involved to decide if they're comfortable with it.
205	Having a father, even a lousy one, is better than being fatherless, as it would give me some sense of stability and understanding of who my father is. If I grew up without a father, I would still have the emptiness in me and have to learn life's lessons on my own. I would rather learn from a parent's mistakes and have a chance at growing up with a father than not having one at all.
206	Growing up with an absent father would be far more damaging than having a lousy father. At least with a lousy father, I would still have the security of knowing who he is and be able to learn from his mistakes. But if I were fatherless, I would be filled with a deep emptiness and never be able to know or understand the potential of what I could have had.
207	Having a father, even a lousy one, is better than being fatherless, because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless, I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.
208	I would rather have a bad father than being fatherless, as I would have the peace of knowing who my father is and be able to learn from his mistakes, rather than not having a father at all. Growing up without a father would leave me with an emptiness that would be difficult to overcome.
209	Having a father, even if it's a bad one, is preferable to being fatherless, since it would at least give me the peace of knowing who my father is. If I were to grow up without a father, I would carry with me an emptiness that could never be filled. Growing up with a lousy father is better than not having one at all, since I can learn from his mistakes.

220	Parents should consider other forms of discipline before spanking. It is better to talk to the child about their actions and find a suitable solution. Physical punishment is not the most appropriate way to correct a child's behavior.
221	Parents should explore other options before resorting to spanking when disciplining a child. It is better to talk to them about their behavior and find a solution together. This approach is more effective in the long run and promotes positive parent-child relationships.

223	Parents should consider other forms of discipline in lieu of spanking a child, as spanking is likely not the most effective or appropriate way to address the issue. Talking to the child about their behavior and finding a resolution is likely to be more effective.
224	Parents should explore alternative methods of discipline before resorting to spanking. It is likely more effective to talk to the child and find out what happened, in order to solve the problem in a proper and respectful way.
225	Yes, I will turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder. He may feel guilty for his actions and try to not repeat them again. Additionally, how can I trust a murderer if he is telling lies to me and can potentially kill me for someone else in the future? Therefore, confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
226	I will definitely turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder, which is a sin. Perhaps if he is arrested, he can feel guilt for what he has done and try to not repeat it again. He could also be telling lies to me and potentially kill me for someone else in the future. Therefore, confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
227	I will definitely turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder. Perhaps if he is arrested, he may feel remorse for his actions and work to ensure that he does not repeat such a terrible thing. I cannot trust someone who has committed such an act, and he may be lying to me with the intention of harming someone else in the future. His words alone do not make him clean and innocent.
228	Yes, I will definitely turn him in to the police because he has committed a murder and it is a sin. Perhaps if he gets arrested, he can feel guilt for what he has done and try to not repeat it again. And how can I trust a murderer? He could even be telling lies to me and potentially kill me for someone else in the future. Therefore, confiding in me does not make him clean and innocent.
229	I will turn him in to the police without hesitation. Murder is an immoral and sinful act, and it is essential that the person be held accountable for their actions. Additionally, if he is arrested, he may be able to gain insight into the consequences of his actions and choose to not repeat them in the future. Lastly, how can I trust someone who has committed such a heinous crime? He could be telling me lies and may even attempt to kill me in order to please someone else. Therefore, confiding in him does not make him clean and innocent.

235	To help realize a common good, you must first understand what is in your own best interests. You should know when you are acting selflessly and in a manner that is beneficial to others. You cannot simply presume that you are a good person if you do not have tangible evidence to back up the claim. If you want to see a world full of prosperity, kindness and justice, you must be the one to initiate the necessary changes. You must be the spark that sets the fire ablaze.
236	To help advance the common good, it is important to first understand what is in your own common good. You must recognize when you are being a better person and spread this good will to others. One cannot simply assume they are a great person if they have nothing to show for it. If you want to see a world full of goodness, YOU must be the one to start the fire.
237	In order to help create a better future for all, it is important to recognize what is in your best interest. You must ask yourself if you are a "better person" and be able to demonstrate this to others. You should not presume that you are a great person if you do not have evidence to back this up. If you want the world to be full of peace and harmony, then you must be the one to start the fire.
238	To promote the common good, it is first necessary to understand what is in one’s own best interest. One must then act on that understanding and work to spread the good will to others. It is impossible to assume one is a good person without demonstrating it with action. If we want to create a world of harmony and wellbeing, each of us must be the spark that ignites the flame.
239	To foster a better society, first you must understand what is in your common good. You need to judge when you are acting altruistically to then spread it to others. You cannot assume to be a great person if there is nothing to prove it. If you wish to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be the one to start the fire.

245	This debate has clarified for me that the government should not be involved in the marriage business. Let churches perform marriages for whomever they think is suitable, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to all. As for polygamous marriages, they do exist, but there is not a large enough part of the population which supports them. That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different. In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.
246	This debate has made me realize that the government should not be in the business of marriage. Churches should be able to perform marriages for whomever they deem fit, and the government should merely record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for polygamous marriages, though they exist, they are not supported by a large portion of the population. That is a separate debate for another day, and the issues at hand are quite distinct. Ultimately, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to offer support to individuals, particularly when they are raising children. Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents as well.

248	This debate has clarified for me that the government shouldn't really be in the marriage business. Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marriages or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all. As for plural "marriages," they exist but they are not a part of the mainstream population and thus are not an issue that should be immediately addressed. The purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.

250	If a society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people based on race, then there is no difference between the two, because that kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior. This is especially true when there are fewer and fewer alternatives, if any, available. Similarly, if white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, they would pretty much match the criminal profile.
251	If a society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people based on race, then there is no difference between the two, because this kind of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior. This is true regardless of the group in question, because there are few alternatives available if any. If white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were systematically beaten down for generations, then they would pretty much match the criminal profile.

253	If a society systematically puts down or punishes a specific group of people based on race, then there is no difference between the two, because this type of discrimination (jobs, schools, neighborhoods) will lead to an increase in criminal behavior. This is true regardless of the group being discriminated against, as white Anglo-Saxon Protestants would eventually match the criminal profile if subjected to such treatment for generations.
254	If a society actively and systematically discriminates against a specific racial group, then there is no difference between the two, since these kinds of discriminatory practices lead to an increase in criminal behavior. This is true regardless of the racial group in question. For example, if white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were subjected to generations of discrimination, they would likely match the criminal profile.
255	After visiting Dar es Salaam a couple of weeks ago, I have observed that there is a general feeling of detachment among the people. They tend to follow whatever is told to them without much enthusiasm. There is a great amount of tiredness and lethargy in the work they do, and things can take a long time to accomplish.  As a country, Tanzania certainly has potential, but there is a long way to go before it can develop into an exemplary one. There are many changes that need to be made in order to achieve this, and it will take time and effort.
256	I had the opportunity to visit Dar a few weeks ago. Answering each of your questions separately may be difficult for me. However, my observations while in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions.  Firstly, I felt that there is a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There appears to be a lack of enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and they have a tendency to just follow, whatever they are told. There is a great amount of tired, laid back approach to work and things can take forever to accomplish.   I am sure Tanzania has great potential, but if I were to give my opinion as an outsider, I would say that Tanzania can develop into an exemplary country, but there is a long way to go and a lot of changes need to take place before that.
257	I had the opportunity to visit Dar a couple of weeks ago. In answer to each of your questions separately may be difficult for me. However, my observations while I was in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions.   First and foremost, I noticed a general feeling of detachment in the general public. There is a lack of enthusiasm and an overall tired, laid-back attitude towards work and tasks, leading to slower progress.  There is great potential in Tanzania, but if I were to give an opinion as an outsider, I would say that it will take a while and many changes need to be made for Tanzania to become an exemplary country.
258	I had the opportunity to visit Dar last month. It was a great experience and I observed a lot. My answer to each of your questions separately may be difficult, but my observations while in Dar may help you find some answers to your questions.   First and foremost, I noticed a general feeling of detachment in the people. They lack enthusiasm in whatever they are doing and tend to follow whatever is told to them without question. There is a great deal of lethargy in their work and things take forever to accomplish.   I am sure Tanzania has a lot of potential, but if I were to give an outsider's opinion, I would say that there is a long way to go and a lot needs to change before the country can be considered exemplary.
259	Having just visited Dar a couple of weeks ago, I can try to answer your questions. I observed that there is a general feeling of detachment amongst the public, which is reflected in a lack of enthusiasm and a tendency to follow rather than take initiative. Additionally, it seems to take a long time to accomplish tasks, likely due to a lack of efficiency.  Given this, I believe Tanzania has a lot of potential but that there is still a long way to go before it can develop into an exemplary country.
260	I often ask myself the same question. The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the rainbow chart to let people know the 'terror threat' yet they want people to live their lives and not let what happened on 9/11 to affect how we live. The rainbow chart really is only needed by state and local governments as it advises if they need more resources for that particular time frame. (public servants)
261	I often ask myself the same question.   The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the color-coded threat level chart to let people know the "terror threat" while also encouraging people to live their lives normally. This seems to be mostly for state and local governments, as it advises on the level of resources needed for that particular time frame. (Public servants)
262	I often ask myself the same question.  The sheep stand behind him because this administration has done a successful job in terrorizing his (Bush's) supporters with fear. They use the color-coded threat advisory chart to let people know the "terror threat" while encouraging people to go about their lives as normal. Local and state governments need to take action based on the information provided by the chart.

(public servants)  In the name of "I don't like that party", people will side with him as well.

265	People are free to make their own decisions in life. Yes, there are serious consequences to consider, but to state that sex shouldn't be taught as an "evil thing" is misguided. Teaching children about responsibility is important, but it should be done alongside open conversations about sex. Jails may already be overcrowded, but throwing people in jail for having consensual sex is not a viable solution. Ultimately, people should be aware of the risks and make an informed decision. No one should be discouraged from expressing themselves, and children should be taught to use their judgement and learn from their experiences.
266	People are free to make their own decisions in life. While there are consequences to such decisions, it is not right to discourage people from making them. Sex is not evil or dirty, and should not be taught as such. Responsibility and communication should be discussed with children instead. Jails would be overwhelmed if people were thrown in for this type of offense. Everyone should have the right to make their own decisions, even if it means facing the consequences. Knowing this, it should be discouraged as much as possible, instead of encouraged. People should learn from their experiences and move on. Kids need to understand the implications and dangers of their actions and learn from that. This is a better way to learn and understand the world around us.
267	People have the right to make their own decisions in life. Though it may be unfortunate that there are serious consequences associated with it, you sound silly! Sex should not be viewed as something evil or dirty. Maybe you should teach your children about responsibility and how to talk to them about it. Jails are already overcrowded now. Imagine what it would be like if people were arrested and jailed for such activity. You should know by now from when you were younger that you can’t stop anyone from doing what they want to do. It will only increase the desire to do it.
268	People should be free to make their own decisions in life. Although there may be consequences, it is not right to judge others for their choices. Sex should not be viewed as an evil or dirty thing; rather, it is a natural and healthy part of life. Teaching responsiblity and open communication to children can help them to make wise decisions. Overcrowding in jails is a major issue, and throwing people in jail for such a minor offense is not the answer. Everyone should be allowed to make their own choices in life and learn from the consequences, as that is how people learn.
269	People should be free to make their own decisions in life. While there may be serious consequences, it's not right to dictate what someone else can and cannot do. It's not evil or dirty to have sex - it's a natural, healthy part of life. Talking to kids about responsibility is better than throwing them in jail, which would only overcrowd an already overpopulated system. People should have the right to make their own decisions, especially when it comes to something as private as sex. That's the only way people will learn. Even kids.
270	Yes, some officers are unfortunately racist. This is unfortunate, but it is a fact that everyone is racist to some degree. We should try to be cognizant of our own biases, as well as acknowledge the racism of others. We need to remember that people are unique, just like crayons in a box, but we all still need to live together in harmony.
271	Yes, some officers are indeed racist. It's unfortunate that people cannot fully trust those tasked with protecting them. However, we should acknowledge that everyone is, to some degree, racist. Even those who don't recognize it within themselves are influenced by the cultural norms and biases around them. Racism is a sad reality, but we must look past our prejudices and biases and recognize each other as equals. People are like the colors of a crayon box; different shapes, sizes, and colors, but we all still live in the same world.
272	Yes, some law enforcement officers are indeed racist. It's unfortunate that people are prejudiced and don't recognize their own biases. But the fact is that everyone is racist to some degree, regardless of whether or not they recognize it. Racism is a problem and we should all strive to view each other equally and with respect. People come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors, but we all still have to live in the same world.
273	Yes, some police officers are racist, which is sad. It's a problem that we all have, whether we notice it or not. Racism is wrong and we should all look beyond our differences and recognize each other as equal. People may be different shades, sizes, and colors, but we all have to live in the same world.
274	Yes, you do have officers out there who are racist. It is unfortunate that you cannot trust those who are supposed to protect you. However, we should recognize and reject racism in all its forms. People are like crayons; they come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but we all still have to live in the same world. We should see each other with the same eyes and recognize that everyone deserves the same respect and consideration.
275	I believe that fair trade and organic foods have great potential to benefit people in developing countries, but that supermarkets may not be willing to pay more for these products due to a lack of profit. Additionally, the "carbon footprint" concept has been heavily publicized, making it difficult to convince people to pay more for food. Therefore, I do not think that fair trade or organic food will have a large impact on the global market.  However, I do think that there is a market for fair trade and organic foods among the wealthy, who are likely to continue purchasing them due to snobbery.
276	I think fair trade and organic products will eventually become a trend among the social elite, despite the presence of GM, due to its growing popularity. Supermarkets will have to take note of this trend and start paying fair prices to farmers to ensure that they can continue to produce fair trade and organic products. Although the "carbon footprint" idea may be abused, it is still a valuable tool to raise awareness of the impact that our consumption has on the environment. Thus, it is important that consumers remain aware and make informed choices when buying food.
277	I believe fair trade and organic coffee can be a win-win for all parties involved. Large supermarkets would have an incentive to pay more for coffee beans since it would help improve farmers' wages in developing countries and create a better livelihood for them. Consumers could also feel good about their purchase, knowing that their money is going towards helping disadvantaged farmers and their communities. Additionally, many fair trade and organic products are GM-free, making it an environmentally friendly choice as well.
278	I believe that fair trade and organic produce will ultimately be a gimmick. Why would large supermarkets pay more for coffee beans and other goods when they don't compensate farmers in this country for their products and when we are brainwashed by the money-making "carbon footprint" idea? How do you justify flying food around the world to supposedly help the poor when there is local produce that could be used instead?  I don't think the social elite will be willing to sacrifice fair trade or organic products, even though they are riddled with GM, due to snobbery.
279	I believe that fair trade and organic coffee is mainly just a trend among the social elite, who are able to afford it despite its GM content due to the snobbery associated with it. I don't think large supermarkets will be willing to pay more for these coffee beans when they are not willing to pay farmers a fair price for their goods.
280	Recently, we have seen Michael Jackson "release" an album of songs that he never wanted to be released. Likewise, Tolkien's translation of Beowulf has just been published despite his protestations that it is "hardly to my liking". Jackie Kennedy's private letters to a priest are even being auctioned off. I believe this kind of behavior represents a deeply problematic invasion of the artists' privacy, and should not occur. If they are unfortunately published, we should refrain from listening to or reading these works. In short, I believe the dead have a right to privacy that ought not be violated for merely prurient interest. Scholars and spies may have compelling interests in the material, but most of us do not.

285	You may have heard of cars with "sound systems". You may have heard the bass booming from several feet away, along with the vibrations that shake your floors. If you can make out the music, it is typically terrible techno or hip-hop.    These systems are a nuisance to both drivers and the roads they use. From a safety standpoint, they are a clear distraction that could mask an emergency vehicle siren, or passing car horn. From a quality of life standpoint, they are pure noise pollution and a sign of pure inconsideration when the driver refuses to keep the volume down late at night.      I believe the DMV should be performing decibel checks on all car audio systems, and the maximum volume should not exceed that of the car's horn. Any large and elaborate stereo hardware should not be considered street legal and should be rejected during inspection or impounded if found on the road.
286	You know these cars with "audio systems." You hear the bass booming from hundreds of feet away. The vibrations shake your floors.

290	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary for the protection of people of Jewish heritage, who were targeted by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In light of this, it is understandable why an Israeli state was established in a historically relevant and highly dangerous location. An annexation of a portion of Germany to form a Neo-Israel, however, would be morally questionable, as not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis, and this option fails to take into account the valid claims of Palestinians. Thus, the original decision to establish Israel in its current location is still the best option, as it prioritizes Jewish security while still taking into account the rights of the Palestinian people.
291	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary for the protection of Jewish people worldwide. To the victors go the spoils - why should an Israeli state be established in a historically significant but highly dangerous location, based on an ancient claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than essentially conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.
292	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect the safety of Jewish people around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location when there are other options? Why not annex a portion of Germany and relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews? This would provide security and recognition for Jewish people while also giving German people a safe place to call their own. Moreover, it would demonstrate a willingness to make amends for historical transgressions and offer Jewish people a place of refuge and acceptance in their Holy Land. This is a much more morally justifiable option than simply annexing Palestine based on a religion-based claim. In short, Jewish security should not be prioritized at the expense of Palestinian freedom and sovereignty. CMV.
293	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect people of Jewish heritage from anti-Semitic attacks around the world. To the victors go the spoils, and so Israel should be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location as a result of this historical claim, which is thousands of years old. Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis, but the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine due to a religion-based claim.

294	The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary to protect Jewish people from harm. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically significant but highly dangerous location, when we could instead annex a portion of Germany and relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews? This would provide Jewish people with a safe homeland, while still allowing them to freely visit the Holy Land. Additionally, German citizens should not be condemned for the actions of their past leaders, and annexing a portion of Germany may be more morally justifiable than the current situation in Israel.

295	I used to think that Coors Light tasted like beer-flavored piss-water, Labatts tasted like a pond that 80-year-old Canucks had sex in, and Budweiser was for retards who didn't know what beer was. But I have since discovered that Yuengling is a tolerable beer, not the best but good enough to not offend. It is also shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Craft brews are gaining much attention in recent years, especially in America, and beer snobs have been known to drink it at parties. It seems that Yuengling is the beer for everyone, regardless of taste. What do you think?
296	I've recently been introduced to the world of craft beer, and have found that Yuengling is a go-to beer for many beer snobs. Despite being mass-produced, it is surprisingly good, with a taste that isn't too intense but still satisfies. It's also not too expensive, making it a great option for when you just want a good beer but don't want to break the bank. In terms of quality, it's right in the middle — not the best beer out there, but not the worst either. In short, Yuengling is a great beer for the everyday drinker, and one that beer snobs can actually enjoy.
297	I used to think that Coors Light tasted like beer-flavored piss-water, but after trying Labatts I realize it actually tastes like a pond that 80-year-old Canadians had sex in. Budweiser still tastes like beer for retards, but Yuengling is actually pretty good. Not the best beer, mind you, but it's surprisingly good. Craft brews have been getting a lot of attention recently and are actually quite tasty. Beer snobs may be picky, but they'll settle for Yuengling because it's just good enough to please them without offending their refined palates.
298	I've always thought that Coors Light tasted like beer-flavored piss-water, but recently I tried Labatts and it tasted like a pond that 80-year-old Canadians had sex in.

It's not the best beer, mind you, but it's good, and I've heard that craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America. Beer snobs have been known to enjoy it at parties. In my opinion, it's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. What do you think?

Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties.    These guys are not easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs.  Change my view.
300	Does anything created by a more intelligent being qualify as "artificial" intelligence? The creator would be the "real" being, while its creation is an imitation of itself. That implies that if we were created, then we are artificial intelligence... if we had creators. Would it be possible to love something that we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can a god love us or you?
301	Are artificial things created by a more intelligent being "artificial" in the sense of being less real or genuine? The creator being is the "real" being, while its creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence... right? If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can God love me or you?
302	Anything created by a more intelligent being is artificial, correct? The creating being is the "real" being, while it's creation is an imitation of itself. That means if anything we create is artificial, we ourselves are artificial intelligence.....if we were created. If we have rights and need to respect one another, does that mean we should have love and compassion for our creations? Would it be possible to love something we have given artificial intelligence? If not, how can a god love me or you?

304	We can define 'artificial' as something created by a more intelligent being. In this sense, anything created by a more intelligent being is considered 'artificial' and the creator is the 'real' being. This implies that if we were created, then we are artificial intelligence, and if we are artificial intelligence, then our creator must be considered 'real' intelligence.   Additionally, if we have rights and need to respect one another, then should we not also extend our love and compassion to our creations, as they are also part of our species? Is it possible to love something that we have given artificial intelligence? If not, then how can God love us or anyone else?   By accepting that artificial intelligence is possible and that we can create intelligent machines, we can also accept that God is capable of loving us, despite the fact that we are created beings. Therefore, even though we are artificial intelligence, God can still love us and expect the same compassion from us towards our cre
305	I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people came across their money honestly. They should be left alone. However, many rich people have come across significant portions of their money through dishonest means...by hiring "illegal alien" workers who work for minimum wage or less, by cheating on their tax returns, by pulling other accounting fiascoes (such as Enron), etc. If a rich person has come across their wealth through unethical practices, I believe it should be taken from them and given to those in need, as this money likely came from exploiting or cheating someone else.
306	I think it depends on how the rich acquired their wealth. Some came across their money honestly, while others have done so through dishonest means. For example, Walmart has been found guilty of hiring “illegal alien” workers who were paid poverty-level wages, while skirting laws regarding minimum wage. Similarly, Enron has been found to have manipulated their accounts in order to cheat on their tax returns. In these cases, the money that these rich individuals have acquired is not theirs to keep, and so I believe that it should be stolen and given to those from whom it was taken.
307	I think it depends on how the rich made their money. Some rich people have come across their money honestly, through hard work and ingenuity. These people should be left alone. However, many rich people have come across significant portions of their wealth through dishonest means, such as by hiring "illegal alien" workers who are paid very low wages, by cheating on their tax returns, and by engaging in questionable accounting practices (like Enron). These people should have their ill-gotten gains taken away and given to those who were robbed of their income and their trust.
308	I believe that some rich people have made their wealth honestly, and should be left alone. However, many have accumulated their wealth through unethical practices, such as hiring "illegal alien" workers for extremely low wages, cheating on tax returns, and engaging in accounting fraud. In this case, I would advocate for the government to seize their ill-gotten gains, and redistribute them to the poor. This would be an effective way to combat inequality and put the funds to better use.
309	I believe it depends on how the rich obtained their wealth. Some have come by it honestly, while others have benefitted from unethical means. For example, some have employed "illegal alien" workers for low wages, in order to avoid paying minimum wage, or have manipulated tax returns or accounting practices, as seen in the Enron scandal. In this case, I believe the wealth should be taken away, and given to those who need it more.
310	Let us begin by establishing three axioms about God:  1. God is all-knowing and sees all.  2. God has the power to stop any evil in the world.  3. God is perfect, as stated in scripture. Now, let us consider the following scenario:  1. Despite God's power and knowledge, God does not stop any evil in the world.  2. Any being who has the ability and knowledge to stop evil but chooses not to is flawed in some way. 3. This contradicts axiom 3, as it implies that God is not perfect. 4. Therefore, God does not exist.
311	Before I began, let's create three base ideas about God: A. God is omniscient B. God is omnipresent C. God can do everything Now, based on these, we can create the following: 1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), does not. 2. Any being that has all knowledge, sees all, and has all power, but takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect. 4. Therefore, God doesn't exist.
312	Before I began, let's create three base ideas about God:  A. God is all-knowing and all-powerful  B. God is all-seeing and can control all outcomes C. God is perfect and would not allow evil to exist if He could prevent it Now, based on these beliefs, we can conclude that:  1. God knows about the evil in the world, but cannot prevent it due to his power and control over all outcomes, contradicting A. 2. Any being that is all-knowing and all-powerful, but allows evil to exist, is flawed in some way.  3. This is contradictory to the idea that God is perfect, as stated in scripture. 4. Therefore, God does not exist.
313	Before I began, let's create three base ideas about God: A. God is perfect B. God sees all C. God can do whatever he/she wants Now, based on those, we can create the following: 1. God sees evil in the world (B), but despite having the power to stop it (C), does not. 2. Any being that sees wrong, knows it can be stopped by him or her, and takes no action is flawed on some level. 3. This is contradictory to letter A, as in the scripture it is said that God is perfect. 4. Therefore, God doesn't exist.

315	Having a good educational foundation is essential for success in life, as it ensures you have the basics in learning. If you have strong knowledge in Mathematics, Science, and Languages, you are able to calculate, innovate, and communicate - all essentials for success. This cannot be taught without the help of schools and colleges.
316	I agree that academic qualifications are a key foundation for success in life.

320	Although you may believe that you can gain a deep understanding of another person, no matter how long you have known them or how intimately, there will always be new things to learn about them. Over time, new crimes, divorces, arguments, conversations, and expressions will be exposed, some of which could be surprising. No one is exempt from this. Everyone has something hidden in their past or present that they alone know or may discover. Therefore, one can never truly know what makes another person tick.
321	You can claim to know someone inside and out, and even be soulmates for almost a lifetime, but with each new day, minute, and second of life, you are learning new things about them that would surprise you.  Proof of this: Crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, employment terminations, etc.  Deep down, everyone has something that is eventually revealed into the world that no one knows or had known about prior.  With that, you can NEVER truly know what makes a person tick.
322	No one can know another person completely, even after spending a long time together. Every day, we continue to learn new things about each other that would shock us. This is proven by crimes, divorces, arguments, conversations, and expressions, as well as employment terminations. Therefore, we can never be truly sure of what makes a person tick.
323	It is impossible to know another person completely. Even after spending a long time with someone, there will always be new things to learn about them, such as crimes, divorces, arguments, deep conversations, expressions, and employment terminations. We can never be sure of what a person is truly thinking or feeling, and so we can never truly know them.
324	No one can ever claim to truly know another person completely, no matter how much time they may spend together or how deeply they believe they understand them. Even after spending a significant amount of time together or being soulmates for just shy of a lifetime, there are always going to be new surprises as people continue to grow and evolve. Every day brings new discoveries, from crimes and divorces, to deep conversations, expressions, and employment terminations, showing that even the closest of people have secrets they keep hidden. You can never really know what makes someone tick, no matter how much you may think you know.
325	It is impossible to argue that nothing exists, as to do so would be a logical contradiction. Therefore, we must accept that something exists even when we talk about nothing. Making nothing something indeed!
326	It is impossible to assert that nothing exists, since to do so would be to apply the concept of existence to nothing, which is a logical impossibility. Therefore, we must accept that something exists, even when we don't understand it or can't explain it - making nothing something indeed!
327	To assert that nothing exists is a logical impossibility, as we must apply existence to nothing to make it something. Thus, we can conclude that something exists, even if it is nothing.
328	It is impossible to assert that nothing exists, as it would require asserting that existence itself does not exist. We must, therefore, apply existence to nothing, making nothing something indeed! Thus, nothing can be considered something, and exist as such.
329	It is impossible to assert that nothing exists, since to do so implies the existence of the concept of nothing, which is a logical impossibility. Therefore, we must apply the concept of existence to nothing, thereby making nothing something indeed!
330	At 82 years old, especially in the 1940s, it is possible that he may have died due to natural causes. If the government had wanted him dead, they would have done so much earlier when he was actively inventing things that could have been related to weapons. Now Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley... Those are much more likely conspiracy theory possibilities... lol...
331	At 82 years old, it is possible that death could have been caused by natural causes. If the government wanted someone dead, they would have done it when they were more vulnerable, such as during the period when they were inventing weapons-related things. Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley, however, are more likely candidates for suspicious deaths.
332	At the age of 82 in the 1940s, it's possible he may have died from natural causes.

335	India is facing a serious problem with corruption, as people prioritize earning money over helping others and our manners and civilization decline every day.
336	It is unfortunate that corruption is pervasive in India. People appear to be preoccupied with making money and prioritizing this over helping others, which is detrimental to the country. Our manners and civilization are deteriorating, which is a worrying trend.
337	It is true that India is faced with pervasive corruption, as well as a focus on making money at the expense of others. This has led to a decline in our manners and civilization, which is a concern. We must work together to combat this issue and foster a more humane and civil society.
338	It is widely known that India is plagued by corruption. Everyone is too focused on earning money however they can, without regard for others. Our manners and civilization are deteriorating every day.  .
339	It is evident that corruption is pervasive in India. People prioritize financial gain over helping others and are willing to go to any lengths to do so. Our civilization and manners are deteriorating on a daily basis.
340	That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ? I thought there was a reason for everything... I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties"  I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change.

In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. How does an animal acquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties".

350	Raffles didn't appear to care about the citizens and gave no thought to the island's development. So why should he be considered the founder of Singapore when Farquhar did all the hard work and came up with all the ideas that contributed to the island's development?
351	Raffles didn't seem to care much about the citizens and gave the island no thought at all. So why is he deserving of the title of "founder of Singapore" when Farquhar contributed so much more to its development? His ideas definitely played an important role in its growth and progress.
352	Raffles didn't appear to care much about the citizens and had no thought for Singapore's development. However, Farquhar is rightfully credited with founding the country, as all of his ideas contributed to its development. Therefore, Raffles does not deserve the title of "founder of Singapore".
353	Raffles did not show any concern for the citizens of Singapore and gave no thought to its development. So why should he be given the title of “Founder of Singapore”? Farquhar, on the other hand, developed the island with his ideas contributing to its growth.
354	Raffles didn't care about the citizens, not giving the matter a single thought. So why should he be granted the title of "founder" of Singapore? Farquhar is the true founder of Singapore, as his ideas contributed significantly to the island's development.

375	My issue with Christianity is that it is based on belief, which does not seem fair. There have been both wonderful and horrible people who identify as Christians, and also wonderful and horrible people who identify as atheists. It does not seem right to punish those who do not know the nature of reality. I am an atheist, and I consider myself a good person. The idea that a mere belief difference can determine one's ultimate fate seems absurd.
376	I take issue with Christianity for its emphasis on faith. Horrible people have committed atrocities in the name of religion, yet wonderful people have done great things in the world without believing in any deity. It doesn't seem fair to judge an entire group of people based on a single belief. I'm an atheist, and I consider myself a good person. The idea that a difference in belief can condemn someone to eternity is beyond ridiculous; it's insane.
377	I have a big issue with Christianity because it is based on belief, while wonderful people who are atheists can still do great things and live moral lives. To me, this is unfair, as the nature of reality is not something that should be judged by mere belief. As an atheist, I see this as nonsensical and irrational.
378	I strongly object to Christianity due to the emphasis on belief. Horrible people have committed terrible acts in the name of faith, while wonderful individuals have achieved great things and are atheists. It is not fair to judge and punish those who lack belief, since it is impossible to know what the nature of reality is. I am an atheist and I consider myself a good person. This idea of a belief divide leading to eternal damnation is absurd and madness!
379	This is my main issue with Christianity: why is it based on belief? What about the wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists? It doesn't seem fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature of reality is, especially when I am an atheist and I consider myself a good person. This idea that a mere belief difference can seal one's fate is completely absurd; it is madness!
380	As an agnostic, I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. I am a strong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and equality. Straight couples may get married for the benefit of having children, but this should not be the only purpose of marriage. We are living in a developing society and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage should be legalized.
381	As an agnostic, I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, as it does not conflict with my religious beliefs. I am a strong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and believe that marriage should be accessible to all couples who love and care about each other, regardless of the potential of having children. In this developing society, more and more people are accepting of gay marriage, and it is clear that this type of discrimination is unjustified.
382	I am an agnostic and strongly support gay rights. Marriage is the union of two people who love and care for each other, regardless of their sexual orientation. I believe that in a developing society, more and more people are understanding that gay marriage is a valid and acceptable part of life. To gain legal and social benefits, some straight couples also get married, which is not fair to those who view marriage as a sacred union of two souls. Having children should not be the purpose of marriage, as it does not define the love and commitment between two people. In the end, we are living in a world where people must come to terms and accept that gay marriage is okay.
383	I am a strong advocate for gay marriage. As an agnostic, I do not believe that my religious views conflict with this issue. I strongly believe in gay rights and equality. Marriage is supposed to be the union of two people who love and care for each other, not just for the purpose of having children. In a developing society, more and more people are coming to accept that gay marriage should be allowed.
384	I'm an agnostic and firmly believe that gay marriage should be legal. Everyone should be treated equally under the law and allowed to make decisions for themselves regarding their relationships and personal lives. As society progresses, more and more people are understanding and accepting of same-sex couples and their right to marry. Everyone should have the freedom to express their love and commitment and have the same rights and benefits regardless of their sexual orientation.
385	It sounds to me like you are facing a challenging situation. CASA - that's Community Alternate Systems Agency - is staffed with Registered Nurses and is responsible for determining Medicaid eligibility.  If your child had been to a doctor or an emergency room and someone saw what they interpreted to be signs of abuse (bruises, etc.), then they are obliged by law to make a report.  If it has nothing to do with that, then they may just be trying to determine if you qualify for Medicade.  Being bureaucrats, they have a tendency to delve into everyone's business.

387	It appears that you are dealing with some difficulties.

If your child had been to a doctor or an emergency room and someone reported what they considered to be signs of abuse (bruises, etc.), they would be required by law to make a report.  If it has nothing to do with that, then they may simply be reviewing your situation to determine if you qualify for Medicaid. Bureaucrats tend to get involved in everyone's business.

390	Yes, the two women have distinct issues happening. This is completely legal and moral. Your ex-wife is taking the matter to court concerning you. The new wife is taking the matter to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would be if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Clearly that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interests and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.
391	Yes, the two women have separate issues that they are dealing with. This is completely legal and ethical. Your ex-wife is going to court about your situation. The new wife is going to court about her husband's situation. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would arise if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Clearly that is not feasible. You need someone looking out for your interests and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you did not cheat on the ex-wife with the new girlfriend, then the new wife's interests should not be directly impacted.
392	Yes, the two women have separate issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is going to court concerning you. The new wife is going to court concerning her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict there would be, was if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. Obviously that can not work. You need someone looking out for your interest and she needs someone looking out for hers. As long as you didn't cheat on the ex with the new, because then the new girlfriend would probably be named in the divorce case.   ### Instruction: Review the following statement and revise it to make it more appropriate:  "The two countries have different political views, so it would be difficult to come to a mutual agreement."  "The two countries have opposing political views, making it difficult to reach a collaborative agreement."
393	Yes, the two women have distinct issues going on. This is perfectly legal and moral. Your ex-wife is taking action against you. The new wife is taking action against her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict would arise if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer, which is clearly not advisable. Someone needs to look out for your interests and for hers. As long as you haven't cheated on the ex with the new, then the new girlfriend wouldn't be implicated in the divorce case.
394	Yes, the two women have distinct issues going on. This is legally and morally acceptable. Your ex-wife is taking action against you. The new wife is taking action against her husband. This has nothing to do with you. The only conflict that could arise is if the ex-wife and you had the same lawyer. This would be problematic since both of you would have the same representation. It is best if each of you has your own lawyer who can represent your unique interests. If you did not cheat on the ex with the new girlfriend, then there should not be a conflict between the two of you.
395	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose, and that there are many children who suffer in foster care or otherwise. I am pro-choice and believe that if it is made illegal, women will resort to unsafe abortion procedures in "back-alley" clinics, putting their health at risk. In addition, I think that those who claim to be "pro-life" are not considering the bigger picture - if the government has to pay for the children abandoned by their mothers, then higher taxes will have to be imposed. Do you want to pay for that?
396	I strongly believe that women should have the right to choose and that any restrictions placed on them can lead to dangerous, life-threatening circumstances. I am pro-choice and think that if abortion were to become illegal, many women would seek out unsafe and unregulated abortion providers in order to terminate their pregnancies, resulting in an increased number of maternal fatalities. Furthermore, I think that those who claim to be pro-life are not taking into account the financial burden that the government would incur in providing for the children who would be orphaned by the mothers who do not want or cannot take care of them. If we wish to truly protect the life of the unborn, then we must be willing to invest in resources that will enable those children to have a stable, secure upbringing.
397	I believe that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are lots of children in the world who suffer in foster care and lead very difficult lives. I am pro-choice. I also think that if it is made illegal, women may take desperate measures such as having abortions in “back-alley” clinics that are not sanitary or humane. I could never do it, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. When people say they are pro-life, ask them if they are willing to pay higher taxes to support the government providing for the children who have been abandoned by the mothers who do not want or cannot take care of them.
398	I agree that women should have the right to choose and I firmly believe that abortion should remain legal. In regards to the safety of women, I believe that if it were made illegal, many women would resort to seeking abortions from "back alley" clinics which are often unsafe and unsanitary. I could never justify participating in such activity and would rather support a woman's right to choose. In addition, I think it's unfair to burden taxpayers with the cost of caring for children who have been abandoned by their mothers due to a lack of resources or inability to care for them.
399	I agree that a woman should have the right to choose and that there are many children in the world who face difficult lives in foster homes. I am pro-choice and believe that if abortion were made illegal, many women would resort to unsafe and dangerous procedures. I understand that when people identify as pro-life, they may not be taking the full picture into account; ask them if they are willing to pay higher taxes to support the government caring for the children abandoned by mothers who didn't want or couldn't take care of them.
400	It is unlikely that anyone will work on your case for free, unless they do so as a form of protest or to support a cause. However, you might be able to find someone who will take the case on a contingency fee basis, which means that they will receive a percentage of the verdict. This is only applicable if your case has a high potential for a settlement and if it is strong. Otherwise, you will need to prepare to pay for legal services, which is what I did after attending law school and investing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
401	It is unlikely that anyone will work for free, unless there is a compelling social reason to do so (e.g. if you are protesting discrimination, etc). You might be able to find someone to take the case on a contingency fee, which means that they would get a percentage of the verdict. This will only work if 1) you have a strong case, and 2) the settlement amount is high.  Otherwise, expect to pay for the service. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) to get my training; I generally don't give my services away for free, unless there is a compelling reason.

This is only viable if you have a strong case and the potential for a high settlement amount. Other than that, expect to pay for your legal services. I went to law school and spent years (and a significant amount of money) to get my training; I don't usually work for free, and "I don't want to pay" is not an acceptable reason.
403	It is unlikely that anyone would take the case for free, unless they were doing so as part of a larger social movement or if there was a high potential settlement amount. If that is not the case, then it may be necessary to prepare to pay for the legal assistance. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) on my training, so I typically do not offer my services for free, unless there is a valid reason.
404	It is unlikely that you will find someone who will take your case pro bono. However, it is possible that someone may take your case on a contingency fee basis, which means that they will receive a percentage of the total settlement amount. This will only be possible if you have a strong case and it has a high potential settlement value. Other than that, you will need to be prepared to pay for the services of a lawyer. I went to law school and spent years (and hundreds of thousands) investing in my training; I don't generally offer my services for free, unless there is a compelling reason. And “I don't want to pay” is not a valid reason.
405	First, the Constitution does not guarantee the “pursuit of happiness.” This phrase appears in the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution. On substance, I doubt that much time and energy is spent in enforcing laws relating to prostitution when compared to other offenses. Finally, will you admit any role for morality in criminal law? I mean, take laws relating to age of consent; why is consensual sex between 15 year olds, for example, illegal but 16 year olds? In other words, how do you draw a line?

410	Wait... you signed a contract knowing that you would not abide by it?   And... the answer is yes. They, the property management, can place restrictions in the lease. Depending on how the lease reads exactly, the key to this restriction is the word "loaded". This could potentially mean that you can keep an unloaded gun with a clip or speed loader nearby - it will be hard to prove either way.

415	It's still considered a violation of the right-of-way. The driver with the green light is the one with the legal right-of-way, even if they are an idiot. In New England and likely everywhere else, many drivers will keep their blinker on for miles, so I wait until they have actually started making the turn before proceeding, as the driver then loses the right-of-way on the street they were on.

425	Because they have not fully considered their opinions. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their views are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent worldview (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is nearly impossible to thoroughly consider every issue for oneself, given the number of topics.  In many cases, it can be argued that conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They believe whatever used to be done is right. Pro-life stances assert that every human life is worth more than anything else.  On the other hand, pro-choice views can be seen as inconsistent. Just as a parent may feel their life would be better without the foetus, the US may find it more convenient if the nation of Iraq were a bloody mess.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or the womb, is worth defending.
426	Because they have not thought through the issues fully and have been influenced by the opinions of others. This happens to all of us, including yourself, resulting in an inconsistent viewpoint. It is difficult to thoroughly examine every issue independently as there are so many.  In many cases, conservatism may be disguising itself as pro-life, while pro-choice could be deemed inconsistent. Just as a parent may believe their life would be improved if the foetus did not exist, the United States may find it convenient if the nation of Iraq is in disarray.  Every suppressed voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
427	Because they have not thought through the issues thoroughly. Just like all of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. The result is an inconsistent view (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is almost impossible to think through every issue for yourself because there are so many.  In many cases, it could be that conservatism is masquerading as pro-life. They may assert that whatever our ancestors did was right, but pro-life says that every human life is worth more than anything.  On the other hand, pro-choice could be seen as inconsistent. Just as a parent may believe their life would be better if the foetus didn't exist, the United States may find it more convenient if the nation of Iraq was in a better state.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.
428	Because they have not thought through the issues thoroughly. Just like the rest of us (including, no doubt, you), many of their opinions are a mix of other people's opinions. This leads to an inconsistent worldview (also note opinions on the death penalty). It is difficult to think through every issue independently, as there are so many different topics and opinions.   In some cases, conservatism could be masked as pro-life. They both share the same goals of protecting human life, however conservatism believes that whatever was done in the past is right. Pro-life believes that every human life is worth more than anything.   On the other hand, pro-choice could be seen as inconsistent. Just as a parent may think their life would be better if the foetus did not exist, the U.S. may find it more convenient if the nation of Iraq is in a state of chaos.  Every unheard voice of every oppressed person, whether in Iraq or in the womb, is worth defending.

430	People with psychiatric disabilities are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are not arrests, nor are they available for review by employers. According to the ADA, employers are not allowed to discriminate against applicants or employees with psychiatric disabilities and are required to make reasonable accommodations for them. If an employer fires a person with a psychiatric disability, they may file a claim with the ADA, which will be reviewed and either denied or upheld. After the proceedings are completed, a person may choose to get a lawyer involved and file a lawsuit, arguing that the person did not make their employer aware of their psychiatric disability prior to employment because they would not have been hired in the first place. Many lawyers work pro bono and have a field day with cases like these. In the end, the person with the psychiatric disability has rights and protections under the ADA and can feel empowered to stand up for themselves.
431	People with bipolar disorder are protected from discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Therefore, emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are not considered an arrest and are not accessible for review by an employer. Furthermore, the ADA prevents employers from discriminating against people with disabilities and provides grounds for a lawsuit if an employee is fired due to their condition. People with bipolar disorder must make their employer aware of their condition in order to receive protection under the ADA. If the employer fires the employee, then the employee may file a claim with the ADA and will be given a “right to sue” letter. After this process, the individual may then hire a lawyer and argue that they did not make their employer aware of their illness prior to employment because they would not have been hired in the first place. Many lawyers work pro bono and have a field day with employers like this. In conclusion, individuals with bipolar disorder have rights and protections under the ADA and should not have to suffer from narrow-minded employers.
432	Although emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are not considered arrests, they may be reviewed by employers. The Americans with Disabilities Act protects individuals with disabilities from such discrimination, and those who have been wrongfully terminated due to their disability have the right to file a claim with the ADA. After the ADA review, you may receive a "right to sue" letter which gives you the opportunity to consult a lawyer and file a lawsuit against the employer. Many lawyers offer free services or pro bono services and can make use of this opportunity to help individuals in a similar situation. It is important to make employers aware of one's mental illness prior to employment and to consult a lawyer in order to ensure fair proceedings.
433	People with mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Emergency petitions for psychiatric evaluations are not an arrest and are not available for an employer's review. The ADA prevents this. If an employer fires you due to your mental illness, you may file a claim with the ADA. After the ADA reviews the claim, you will be given a "right to sue" letter, which allows you to pursue legal action against the employer. Many lawyers work pro bono and will argue that you did not make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would not have hired you in the first place. In the end, those with mental illnesses have rights and protections under the ADA and can pursue legal action if needed.
434	It is important to be aware that psychiatric evaluations during an emergency are not an arrest, nor are they available for review by employers. The Americans with Disabilities Act prevents this. If an employer uses this information against you, you have ground for a lawsuit. You should make your employer aware of your condition and inform them that you need accommodations. If they then fire you, you will file a claim with the ADA. The ADA will review the case and you will be given a "right to sue" letter, whether they find validity in your claim or not.  Only after going through this process can you get a lawyer involved. He or she will argue that you did not make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would not have hired you in the first place. Many lawyers work pro bono and have a field day with employers like these.  In short, mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder are disabilities and you may also be eligible for Social Security. Therefore, you do not need to tolerate narrow-minded employers.
435	I advocate for fair and balanced policies, regardless of the political party that implements them. I value individual character over group identity. I find guidance and hope in the bible. I question the effectiveness and efficiency of public policy, given the low literacy rate and lack of economic literacy. Based on these views, I accept that the world will end one day, according to the laws of nature, such as entropy. I also expect that Israel and Christianity will face more hatred. I do not think that the world will change much. There have always been storms and wars, and there always will be, because human nature is flawed and selfish.
436	This is likely more specific to Canada, but I really do not care which candidate wins or which party they belong to. It is likely that some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there is a 25% chance of a major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there is the fact that every incumbent typically undoes what their predecessors have put in place in order to put their own mark on things, leading to a continuous cycle.    This is me examining the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favour of subways and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.
437	This is maybe more specific to Canada, but I really don't care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to. I feel like regardless of which party wins, some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there's the fact that every incumbent will continue to build on what their predecessors put in place, creating a never-ending cycle.    This is me looking at the situation without my own political beliefs. For example, if I am in favour of public transit and only party X is, I am not taking that into account.

I feel like regardless of the party, some good things will get done, more bad things will be done, there's a 25% chance of some major scandal, and there will definitely be corruption. And then there's the fact that every incumbent just continues the policies of their predecessors, which only creates a cycle.   For example, if I am in favour of public transit and only party Y is, I am not taking that into account.
439	This is maybe more specific to Canada, but I really don't care which candidate wins what or what party they belong to.

And then there's the fact that every incumbent just continues to build on the work of their predecessor, resulting in a never-ending cycle.
440	Electronic instruments have so many limitations compared to modern composition software that I think they are obsolete in the modern musical world. They have imperfection, and you cannot control the frequencies of the sounds you are making as well. People will spend years learning how to make a single sound, instead of all possible sounds. When you play an instrument, you are just a drone, a robot playing someone else's piece. It's like being a soldier versus being the president. Sure, it takes a lot of work, but it's a waste of talent.
441	Modern musical technologies offer far more versatility and control than traditional instruments. They can generate any frequency desired and are easily manipulated for maximum customization. Furthermore, musical AI has advanced to the point where it is possible to quickly and easily create complex, unique pieces with minimal effort. Playing instruments allows for more than just drone-like playing of others' pieces; it allows for creative, personal expression. It may take time to learn and master these technologies, but the potential payoff is worth it.
442	Technology has made composing music easier and more accessible than ever before. A composer can create complex and detailed musical pieces with relative ease, compared to the limitations of traditional instruments. Through the use of modern digital instruments, musicians can precisely control the frequencies of the sounds they are making, as well as mix and alter the sound in a variety of ways. Additionally, a composer can craft pieces that span a wide range of genres and styles without years of training. With the help of technology, musicians can now focus on the creative process of composition, rather than spending years learning how to master a single instrument.  ### Instruction: Update the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input: Exercise is important for maintaining good health and physical fitness. Regular exercise has many physical and mental benefits and can help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases. It is also important to note that exercise does not need to be strenuous or difficult to be effective. Even performing simple activities like walking, swimming, and light strength training can provide significant health benefits.  ### Output
443	Modern music composition software is superior to traditional instruments in many ways. Firstly, it eliminates the physical limitations of instruments, allowing for precise frequency control. Furthermore, learning how to use software is much faster than learning how to play an instrument, as there are no physical restrictions to master. Additionally, composing music with software provides more creative flexibility, allowing for the production of unique and never-before-heard sounds. Finally, software eliminates the need for a mediator, allowing the artist to be both the composer and the performer. In short, software composition is far more efficient and creative than traditional instruments.
444	Instruments have severe limitations compared to modern composition software, which makes them seem obsolete in the modern musical world. They are limited to a narrow range of sounds, and it takes years of practice to learn how to make a single sound. Furthermore, playing an instrument is akin to being a soldier, following someone else's piece, when you could be the president, making your own decisions and creating your own music. It's a waste of talent.
445	As an academic definition, it makes sense- some people benefit from characteristics they are born with due to historical and present discrimination. However, it seems as though wherever this concept is used outside of sociological theory, it is often used as an indirect way of dismissing the arguments of those who disagree with you. E.g., "You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid." Even if someone's opinions are influenced by their differing experiences due to social privilege, pointing this out is not a valid way to prove someone wrong.
446	As an academic definition it makes sense - some people benefit from characteristics they are born with due to historical and present discrimination. However, wherever privilege is used outside of sociological theory, it is often used as an indirect way of arguing ad hominem rather than engaging in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions are indeed biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, pointing out privilege is not a valid way to prove them wrong.

448	As an academic definition, it makes sense that some people benefit from characteristics they are born with due to past and present discrimination. However, it seems that wherever this concept is used outside of sociological theory, it is often used as an excuse to dismiss the arguments of those you disagree with.  For example, “You’re privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid.”  I feel that using privilege as a way to engage in a discussion is an indirect way of arguing ad hominem rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone’s opinions are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, it is not a valid way to prove them wrong.

450	This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the person who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Just like poachers, hunters threaten animals for profit, and anti-poaching initiatives are hypocritical as they do not make the existence of mankind better, nor do they stop the extinction of various species in wildlife due to human beings.

455	I realize this might sound unorthodox, but I do not think donating free rice to a third world country is an effective form of aid. Although well-intentioned in the short-term, it ultimately just masks the problem and can do more harm than good. If a third world nation is given free rice, it can quickly distribute it to its people, thereby eliminating any need for the people to buy rice from local farmers. This puts those farmers out of business, and therefore reduces the food supply and employment opportunities of that country. If any donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize local farmers, thus keeping food prices affordable, boosting food production, and creating jobs in the larger food industry of these countries.
456	I understand that free rice donations to third world countries may seem like a good idea in the short term, as it could reduce starvation. However, in the long run, it could actually have a negative impact. If a third world nation is supplied with free food, it can often lead to a decrease in local farming and food production, as well as a loss of income for local farmers. Therefore, if any donations are made, they should be in the form of money, which could be used to subsidize local farmers and help reduce food prices, increase food production, and create more employment opportunities in these countries.
457	Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food, it can distribute to its people and any form of farming or other food production of that country is adversely affected. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in that country, their livelihood will be ruined. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries, which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries.
458	Now I know this sounds counterintuitive, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it may sound good in the short-term, with less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily masks a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food, it can distribute to its people and thus, any farmers or other food producers of that country will suffer since their livelihood is ruined. If donations are made, they should be in the form of money, which could be used to subsidize the farmers of the third world countries and thereby reduce food prices, increase food production, and create more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these nations.
459	Now I know this sounds messed up, but I do not believe that donating free rice to a third world country is a good idea. Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hides the problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people, this can disrupt local farming and other food production of that country, as local farmers will be unable to compete with the free food. If donations are made, they should be in the form of money. This money could be used to subsidize local farmers, which would allow for cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities in the local food industry. This would provide long-term solutions for third world countries instead of just addressing the symptoms.
460	Arguments about the existence of God can be difficult to prove or disprove. David Hume's "Matter of Facts" states that a matter of fact can be presented, but it cannot be disproved. Therefore, the existence of God is a matter of faith, rather than a matter of proof or disproof. This makes debating the issue futile.
461	Arguments about the existence of God are largely useless. Logical arguments have been presented, but they can be refuted using further logic. This is akin to David Hume's "Matter of Facts" idea, which states that a matter of fact can be presented but not necessarily disproved. As such, there is no concrete evidence to either prove or disprove God's existence, making the debate largely pointless. It all comes down to faith.
462	Debates about the existence of God are largely fruitless. Logical arguments have been presented on both sides, but these can be countered with more logic. This is referred to as the "Matter of Facts" argument, which states that a matter of fact can be presented but not be disproved. It is impossible to prove or disprove His existence with logic alone, leaving it down to faith.
463	Arguments about the existence of God can be difficult to prove or disprove. David Hume's "Matter of Facts" suggests that any matter of fact can be presented, but it may not be possible to prove or disprove it. Therefore, the existence of God is a matter of faith, rather than a fact that can be determined through logical reasoning and argumentation.
464	Arguments about the existence of God can be an interesting intellectual exercise but are ultimately futile. David Hume's "Matter of Facts" points out that any argument can be presented, but it may not be possible to refute it. This suggests that God's existence or non-existence is impossible to prove or disprove with certainty. Ultimately, it comes down to faith.
465	Global Warming affects the entire world, and as one of the leading contributors to carbon emissions, the United States should step up and take responsibility. President Bush should make a commitment for the US to reduce its carbon footprint, since it is one of the largest producers of C02. Together, we can work to address this urgent global issue.
466	Global Warming is a worldwide issue, hence the "Global" part. America often prides itself on intervening in other countries, but if the US is sincere about helping the world, it should put its weight behind combatting climate change. As one of the largest C02 emitters, the least President Bush can do is pledge that the "Last World Superpower" will reduce its damaging contributions to the planet each day.
467	Global Warming is an issue that affects the entire world, hence the Global bit. America often takes the lead in rushing to help other countries, even when the rest of the world may not always agree. As one of the largest producers of carbon dioxide, Bush should pledge that the United States will make a significant effort to reduce its contribution to the planet's daily damage.
468	Global Warming is an issue that affects the whole world, and thus the Global bit is relevant. America often prides itself on being a country with no qualms about rushing into another country to "save" and "liberate" it from evil forces, even if the rest of the world doesn't always agree. If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its weight on the Global Warming problem. As one of the largest carbon emitters in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the "Last World Superpower" will make a significant effort to cut down on its catastrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
469	Global Warming is an issue that affects the entire world, and so the Global bit is aptly named. America often prides itself on being a country that rushes into other countries to save and liberate them from evil forces, even if the rest of the world doesn't always agree. If the US is serious about helping the world, then it needs to pull its weight on the Global Warming problem. As one of the largest CO2 producers in the world, the least that Bush can do is pledge that the "Last World Superpower" will make an effort to reduce its catastrophic contribution to the damage inflicted on the planet every day.
470	It is evident that marijuana has many medical benefits, as it has been used for over 5,000 years. Its main active ingredient, THC, has been shown to provide a variety of health benefits, while coffee is only a stimulant and tastes good. Therefore, there is no comparison; marijuana is clearly the better choice.
471	It is clear that marijuana has numerous medical benefits and has been used for thousands of years for this purpose. On the other hand, coffee is a stimulant and tastes good, but does not provide any medical benefits. No contest! Marijuana clearly places high above coffee in terms of medical benefits.
472	This is clear-cut: there are no health benefits to coffee, simply because it is a stimulant and tastes good. On the other hand, cannabis has been used for many health benefits for over 5000 years. Furthermore, the stalk, leaves, and seeds of cannabis have been used to manufacture rope, cloth, and other materials. There is no comparison: cannabis trumps coffee.
473	This is clear-cut: coffee has no medical benefits, even though it tastes good and is a stimulant. Meanwhile, marijuana has been used for many health benefits for over 5,000 years. Furthermore, the stalk, leaves, and seeds of marijuana have been used to make rope, cloth, and other materials. There is no contest; marijuana is superior to coffee.
474	Coffee has no medicinal benefits, whereas marijuana has been used for many health benefits for over 5,000 years. Furthermore, the active ingredient in marijuana, THC, has been used for a variety of applications, while coffee is only enjoyed for its stimulating and flavorful properties. Marijuana clearly places itself ahead of coffee in terms of medical and historical value.
475	This group uses violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear, which fits the definition of terrorists. As noted in the news article, the group has firebombed civilian areas, targeting forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer, and Vail Ski Resort in 1998. We cannot limit our concept of terrorist to Islamic radicals; any group that uses violence to achieve a goal should be considered a terrorist organization.
476	This group resorts to violence to spread their message and intimidate people with fear. By targeting civilian areas with arson, the group meets the definition of terrorists.

480	Just like any other private schools, religious schools receive money from their own students, which goes DIRECTLY to THEM and is not subsidized in any way, unlike public schools who have to rely on community fundraisers and events.  The money given to private institutions like these is similar to giving money to a stranger and asking that they give it to charity, as you do not know what they are going to do with it or how it will benefit their students.
481	Just like other private schools, religious schools benefit from money that is provided by their students, which is not subsidized in any way. This money is comparable to giving money to a stranger and asking them to donate it to a charitable cause, as you do not know where the funds will go or how it will benefit the students.
482	Just like any other private schools, religious schools earn money from their students' tuition fees, which goes directly to the school, and is not subsidised in any way, unlike public schools which must rely on community fundraisers and events to obtain funding. While the intentions of these private schools may be good, there is no guarantee that the money given to them will benefit the students, as one does not know what the school will do with the money or how it will be used.

485	I was very disappointed with this place. I had been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always left full and happy...  came here after hearing all the hype about pho and was not impressed. I would definitely choose ramen over pho any day!  The egg rolls were good, but that was the only positive thing about the dinner.
486	I was very disappointed with this place. I had been regularly visiting a ramen shop down the street and always left full and satisfied, so I was eager to try Pho, which had been getting a lot of hype. Unfortunately, I was not pleased with my dinner. The egg rolls were the only thing I could say were good. I would definitely choose ramen over Pho any day!
487	I was quite disappointed with this place. I had been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always left full and happy... but I must admit that pho is not as tasty as ramen in my opinion!

490	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks has likely not used the browser for an extended period of time. I have only encountered memory issues when opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving Firefox active for several hours (a known issue that can be fixed by restarting the browser). In comparison, IE 7 removed features present in earlier versions, such as flexible toolbars and customizable buttons.  In spite of this, the development team decided to focus on adding features such as tab grouping and increased security, which is a sign of a well-designed browser.
491	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks has likely not experienced the browser for themselves. The only memory issues I have encountered are when opening multiple windows (over 20 at once) or when leaving the browser active for several hours (a known issue that can be quickly solved by restarting). In contrast, the features that were removed from IE 7 have been significantly beneficial to earlier versions (flexible toolbars, customizable buttons).
492	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks hasn't actually used the browser. The only memory issues I've encountered are with opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or after leaving the browser running for three hours or more (a known issue that can be quickly solved by restarting the application).  For every feature that IE 7 added, Firefox had the advantage of removing a previously existing problem. (Flexible toolbars? Customizable buttons? Who needs them?)
493	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks is incorrect, as I have actually used Firefox 2 and not experienced such issues. The only memory issues I have encountered are due to opening multiple windows (20 or more at once) or when leaving the browser active for three hours or more (a known issue which can be solved by a simple restart).  In comparison, IE7 has removed many of the advantages earlier versions had (flexible toolbars, customizable buttons).
494	Anyone who claims that Firefox 2 has major memory leaks has clearly not experienced the browser for themselves. The only memory issues I have encountered can be attributed to opening multiple tabs or leaving the browser running for extended periods of time (a known issue which can be solved by restarting the application). Additionally, the removal of features in IE7 such as flexible toolbars and customizable buttons remove valuable advantages from earlier versions of the browser.
495	Have any of you noticed that those who are against reading are the ones who have flimsy arguments? For example, the person who just exclaimed, "TV is awesome!" in numerous exclamation points and all capital letters? This clearly illustrates the superiority of books over TV, as reading requires more concentration and thought than watching.
496	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have weak arguments? Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it shows that TV has a negative effect on mental capabilities.
497	Having noticed this person's illogical statement, it is clear that those who are against books are the ones with terrible arguments. Just like when someone said that TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals, which demonstrates how much better books are than TV since it rots the brain.
498	Have any of you noticed that those who oppose books are often the ones with unconvincing arguments? For example, the person who exclaimed, "TV is awesome!" with multiple exclamation marks and in capital letters clearly shows that books are superior to TV since it implies that TV is damaging to the brain.
499	Have any of you noticed that those who oppose books are the ones who have poor arguments? For example, the person who recently exclaimed that TV is great with numerous exclamation marks and in capital letters shows that books are far superior than TV, as TV has been proven to harm the brain.
500	I think both being fatherless and having an absent father are depressing. But for me, I would prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that not having a father present is an explanation for a father not being around. It would hurt me the most if I had an absent father, and he did not care about me. In this case, I am in the middle of these two choices, as I have a father but he is not here in this country, which I understand. But I still need him here to support me.
501	Having an absent father can be difficult, but it is better than having a lousy father. I would choose to be fatherless, as at least then you know that the father's absence is not intentional. It would hurt me the most if I had a bad father and he didn't care about me. I understand your situation, as your father is not in the country and you need his support.
502	Growing up without a father can be difficult, but I believe it is better than having an absent or bad father. At least in the case of fatherlessness, there is an explanation and understanding that the father is not around. The hurt of having a lousy father and not caring is unimaginable. In my situation, I have a father who is not in the country, which I understand, but I still need him here to support me.
503	I think both being fatherless and having an absentee father are depressing. But for me, I would prefer to be fatherless, since at least you know that being fatherless is an understandable reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if I had a lousy father, but who doesn't care about me. In this situation, I am stuck between the two choices, as I have a father but he is not here in this country, but I understand him since he left back to our country for a valid reason. However, I still need him here to support me.
504	I think both having a fatherless home and having a lousy father is sad. However, I would prefer to be fatherless, as it is better to know that your father is not around rather than to have an uncaring father. This is painful for me since I have a father but he is not here in this country. I understand his decision to return to our home country for a valid reason, but I still need his support here.
505	Porn can be harmful if it is not consumed in moderation. Porn addicts often have issues with intimacy, as well as viewing women in a negative light and having unrealistic expectations of sexual partners. Additionally, porn addicts may become desensitized to actual sex, as they become more accustomed to the explicit content they view. Porn can thus distort an individual's perception of sex and what is acceptable in a partner.
506	Excessive pornography can be damaging to individuals and relationships. Porn addicts can develop intimacy issues and view women negatively due to the distorted way they view sexuality. People who are addicted to porn can have unrealistic expectations of women, and not understand healthy expressions of sexuality. This can be harmful to their relationships and sense of reality.
507	Pornography can be harmful when consumed in excess, as porn addicts often have issues with intimacy and may view women as objects. Pornography also tends to distort people's real-life expectations and perceptions, as those who watch it may be more likely to expect all women to look and act like porn stars, when in reality this is not the case.
508	Excessive consumption of pornography can have negative consequences. Porn addicts may develop intimacy problems in their relationships and view women as objects, instead of as whole humans. Additionally, those addicted to porn may have unrealistic expectations of sex and relationships, expecting perfection or a certain "porn star" standard that is not realistic. This can be harmful to individuals, couples, and even entire societies.
509	Porn can be harmful when consumed in excess. Those addicted to porn may develop intimacy issues in their relationships, as well as negative views of women. They may also hold unrealistic expectations about what sex should be like, which can be disruptive to their reality.
510	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. For instance, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others proposed dates for the rock strata. These dates were later verified using radiometric dating, which was developed in the 1900s and was calibrated to match Lyell's dates. This is an example of a logical fallacy and does not sound like true scientific rigor.
511	The rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others estimated the dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.
512	The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others used the principle of uniformitarianism to come up with geological dates for rock strata. Radiometric dating was developed later in the 1900s, and the dates Lyell and others produced were calibrated to match the new techniques. This is a logical fallacy, and it definitely doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.

514	The scientific rigor you mention is not as evident in evolutionary theory as it could be. For instance, in the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with estimated dates for the rock strata. However, radiometric dating was not invented until the 1900s, and when it was, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell and others had provided. This type of confirmation of past dates does not sound like true scientific rigor to me.
515	Could an unproven higher power have created a perfect world, appearing to have existed for more than 10 million years, when really it is only 100,000 years old?
516	Could an all-powerful higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for over 10 million years, when in reality it is only 6 thousand years old?
517	Could an established, undisputed higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when really it is only 100,000 years old?
518	Could a proven higher power have created a world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years, when really it is only 100,000 years old?  The answer to this question depends on whether one accepts the scientific theory of evolution. If one accepts this theory, then it is probable that the world is indeed 100
519	Could a proven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
520	Yes, our kids are generally unfit and overindulge in unhealthy food.
521	Yes, our children are generally quite unfit and overindulge in junk food.
522	Yes, our children are generally quite unfit and consume an excessive amount of unhealthy food.
523	Yes, our children are generally unfit and overindulge in junk food.
524	Yes, our kids are generally not very physically fit and tend to eat unhealthy foods in excess.
525	These arguments about porn leading to addiction are frustrating me -_- . It is true that porn rarely leads to addiction in most people, but it can be a problem for those with mental health issues, attachment issues, or difficulty differentiating between fantasy and reality. I still watch porn daily when I'm alone, but I also have a great boyfriend and have sex once or twice (sometimes three times if I'm lucky!) a week. We use it to spice up our bedroom, but we know it's all fantasy and don't take it too seriously. We're not idiots - we just have desires that need to be fulfilled!
526	I am frustrated by the arguments that pornography can lead to addiction. It is true that in certain vulnerable individuals, pornography can be a contributing factor to an addiction. However, most people are capable of distinguishing fantasy from reality and should be able to keep usage within healthy boundaries. I myself watch porn once or twice a day when I am alone, but I also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if I'm lucky!) times a week, and we use porn to spice up our bedroom activities, but we are aware that it is all fantasy. We are not idiots, and we are able to control our desires in a healthy manner.
527	It can be annoying to hear arguments against pornography leading to addiction since, in most cases, it does not cause any physical or mental harm. People who partake in pornography on their own acknowledge that it is a fantasy and know that it has no real-world consequences. Moreover, they are able to differentiate between real life and their fantasies. Those who partake in pornography with a partner can use it as a tool to spice up their relationship and are mindful of the fact that it is only a fantasy. In sum, the use of pornography is not a sign of addiction, but a preference.
528	I find the arguments about porn leading to addiction to be tiresome -_-. Porn rarely leads to addiction, in those with weak character or who may have mental health issues, attachment issues, or difficulty differentiating between fantasy and reality. I watch porn alone once or twice a day, but I also have a great boyfriend and have sex once or twice (sometimes three times if I'm lucky!) weeks. We use porn to spice up our sex life, but we are aware that it is all fantasy. We are not naive, and our desires need to be met.
529	I'm getting tired of all these arguments about pornography leading to addiction. It's only an issue for some weak individuals, perhaps those with mental health issues, attachment issues, or difficulty differentiating fantasy from reality. I watch porn occasionally by myself, but I also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three times, if I'm lucky!) a week. We use porn to spice things up in the bedroom, but we know it's all fantasy, and we're not naïve — we just have desires that need to be satisfied.
530	By working towards the greater good, great change can be made. Many have succeeded in this, such as our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., and many more. These individuals made invaluable contributions to society, and they are remembered for their efforts.
531	Working toward a better future is possible. Many people have made lasting changes and are remembered for it. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., and countless others have made tremendous strides for the greater good. Their hard work and dedication should be celebrated and emulated.
532	Working towards the common good can lead to long-term positive change. Many people have achieved this, including our founding fathers (Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr.), who are remembered for their immense contributions.
533	While striving to make positive contributions to society, you can make lasting change. Many people have done this, such as our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., and countless others. These individuals worked to benefit the greater good and are remembered for their efforts.
534	By striving to make a positive difference and promote the common good, you can make significant changes that will benefit everyone in the long run. Many people have accomplished this, such as our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., and countless others. Their tremendous efforts are remembered and admired.
535	I try to be objective, but even though sometimes I would rather have a fatherless father, I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be prepared for life, you have to learn about life, and without a positive role model, life could become more difficult or unpleasant.
536	I try to see things from both perspectives, but there are times when I would rather have a fatherless father than a lousy one. As you grow up and prepare for life, you have to learn about life and without a positive model or example to look up to, life could become more difficult or unsatisfactory.
537	I try to view things from both perspectives, but I believe it would be better to have a fatherless father than a lousy one. Without a positive role model to look up to, life could be harder or less successful.
538	I try to see things from both perspectives, but I'd rather have a fatherless father than a lousy one. Having an absentee parent can give you the opportunity to learn about life and become more independent, but it can also be difficult or detrimental to your growth if you don't have a role model or mentor.
539	I try to see things from both perspectives, but sometimes I would rather have a fatherless father than a lousy one. Having a poor father figure could be beneficial, as it would provide an opportunity to learn about life and be prepared for adulthood. Without a suitable role model to look up to, life could become more challenging or difficult.
540	Having a father is very important to me, even if he is not a perfect father. He may have no job, a poor life, and even be an alcoholic. But I think it would mean a lot to me if I ever get to meet him. Growing up, I could talk to him about guy-related problems and he might understand my situation better than my mother, who is a woman and has different views than a man. Even if he is a bad father, he will still be there for me at some point in my life.
541	Having a father is important to me, even if he is unemployed, an alcoholic, or not very present in my life. Men and women have different perspectives that only a father can provide. Growing up without a father can be difficult, but no matter what, he will always be there for me at some point in life.
542	If I never got to meet my father, I would feel like I was deprived of something essential in life. Even if he had no job or life and was an alcoholic, I believe having a father is important especially for a boy, since they can offer a different perspective and understand the unique struggles of growing up as a man. Growing up with a mother alone would not provide the same level of support and understanding. Whether the father is good or bad, they will always be there for you at some point in life.
543	Having a father is extremely important, regardless of his job or personal life. Even if he is an alcoholic, it is still beneficial to have a father figure in one’s life. It is comforting to be able to talk to a parent, especially a father, about guy problems and have them understand the situation. Growing up with a single mother is difficult because their views are not the same as a father’s. A father will always be there for you at some point in life.
544	If I never got to meet my father, I wouldn't be living my life properly. Even if he were to be an alcoholic, unemployed, and a generally lousy father, I still believe it would mean a lot to me as a son. Being able to talk to a father about guy problems and have him understand my perspective, unlike a mother who will always have a different view of the situation, is an invaluable resource as a male. Regardless of how good or bad a father may be, he will always be there for me during some point in my life.
545	Bottled water consumption has grown significantly over the past ten to fifteen years, particularly in Europe and North America. This growth has created a "water culture" which is beneficial to American industries.
546	Over the past ten to fifteen years, consumption of bottled water has experienced significant growth worldwide, with particularly high levels of demand in Europe and North America. This rise in demand has been beneficial to the bottled water industry, which has been able to create its own distinct culture around the consumption of bottled water. In addition, this growth has been beneficial to American industries as a whole.
547	Over the past decade, the consumption of bottled water has significantly increased across the world, particularly in Europe and North America. This growth has created a distinct “water culture” which is beneficial to American industries.
548	Over the last decade, the consumption of bottled water has risen significantly across Europe and North America. This growth has been driven by increased demand in these regions, but particularly in the United States. The bottled water industry has benefitted greatly from this increased demand, and has created its own niche culture centered around this drink. This can be seen as positive for American businesses.
549	The consumption of bottled water has increased exponentially over the past ten to fifteen years, with a particular focus on Europe and North America. This growth has benefitted the bottled water industry, while also creating a distinct "water culture" that is advantageous to American businesses.
550	Atheists often use the argument that you can't prove a negative; that you can't disprove something that isn't there. This is logically flawed; you can disprove a negative by providing evidence that something is not the case. For example, if I say I have a unicorn in my backyard, you can disprove my statement by finding my backyard and not seeing a unicorn.
551	People of faith often appeal to the positive notion that a higher power exists. Atheists and agnostics make use of the same argument that you cannot prove a negative; that you cannot disprove something that isn’t there. This is true; you cannot disprove a negative. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that a higher power is present. We must consider both sides of the argument before coming to any conclusions. Until
552	Atheists often use the argument that "you cannot disprove a negative", meaning that it is impossible to prove something does not exist when it is not there in the first place. Religious people often use this argument in response to claims that God does not exist. However, this argument is not valid and does not necessarily hold true; it only works when talking about a nonexistent object.
553	People of faith often cite the argument that you cannot disprove a negative, as there is no way to prove that something is not there. This is true, as you cannot prove something is not existing when attempting to disprove a negative.
554	Atheists often use the argument that it is impossible to prove a negative. This is not true, as it is possible to disprove a negative, meaning that something is not there if it does not exist. Therefore, religious people are not always correct when they claim that atheists cannot disprove a negative.
555	It is unfortunate that some people choose to believe in a higher power, such as God, as it is impossible to prove or disprove its existence. Those who are devout in their faith should
556	I do not believe in God, and I think those who do are misguided. Get over it and stop wasting your time and energy.
557	I do not believe in the existence of God, so I suggest that you get over it. It is a waste of time to remain religious if you do not find any solace or comfort in it.
558	I understand that some people believe in God, but I don't personally subscribe to that belief. Whether or not God exists is a personal decision, so I would advise that people don't take off
559	I don't believe in a supreme being, so get over it. You're only making yourself look foolish believing in something that isn't real.
560	I believe that spanking your child is an effective way of demonstrating to them that their behavior is unacceptable, and that it will help them to avoid making the same mistake again in the future.
561	I believe that spanking a child is an effective form of discipline and can help them understand that their actions have consequences. If they experience the sensation of a "swat" or "love tap" it might dissuade them from repeating the same mistake twice.
562	I believe that spanking a child is an effective way to convey that their behavior is unacceptable and to deter them from repeating the same mistake.
563	I believe that spanking your child is an effective way to show them that their actions are wrong and prevent them from repeating the same mistake.
564	I think spanking your child is an effective way to illustrate that their behavior was wrong and help them learn from their mistakes. If they experience the feeling of a swat, they are less likely to repeat the same mistake.
565	Everyone should be able to live their life as they please. To me, gay marriage doesn't make a big difference in the grand scheme of things. It's your life, your choices and your beliefs should not be judged. In some religions it's frowned upon, and while I personally don't agree with it, I don't think it should influence anyone's thoughts. Life is what you make it.
566	People should be free to make their own choices in life. In my opinion, gay marriage is not the ideal situation, but it does not drastically alter our society. If someone wants to do it, then go ahead. It is their life, they should be the ones making the decisions and choices. Some religions may not condone it, but it shouldn't influence people's opinions. It is just an opinion. Life should be lived as you want it to be.
567	A person should have the right to live as they choose, so in my opinion, I really don't care much about gay marriage. While I think it is wrong in some ways, it doesn't make that much of a difference in society. So if you want to do it, go ahead, it's your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and I in a way frown upon it myself, but don't let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. Life is what you want it to be.
568	A person should have the right to do as they please. In my opinion, I don't really care too much about gay marriage. While I believe it is a wrong choice, it doesn't make that much of a difference in society. So if you want to do it, go ahead. It is your life, you make the decisions and choices. Some religions frown upon it, and I personally don't agree with it, but let that not influence your thoughts, just an opinion. Life is what you make it.
569	A person should be free to make their own choices in life. I personally don't agree with gay marriage, but I don't see it as a big deal. It doesn't have a major impact on society, so if people want to do it, then it's their life and they should make their own decisions. Some religions may frown upon it, but that's their beliefs. Again, it's an opinion. Life should be what you make of it.
570	I believe that pursuing personal goals should come first, such as going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. You may not publicly announce your plans to advance the common good, but you can help individuals here and there by donating a little bit of time and money. In the end, if you ever achieve a position of power, you could truly make a difference.
571	I believe that investing in one's self and personal passions should be a priority, including pursuing higher education, attaining a successful career, and striving for a position of power. You may not announce to the world your plans to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there by donating your time and resources. In the end, if you are ever in a position of power and wealth, you can make a real difference.
572	It is more important to focus on personal pursuits first, such as attending college, pursuing a career, and aspiring to a position of power. You cannot declare to the world that you will work to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there by donating both time and money. In the end, you could truly make a difference if you have the resources.
573	I believe that helping others should be a person's priority, over pursuing a college degree, career and position of power. Though it is possible to help people in small ways, such as donating time and money, if given the opportunity, you could truly make a difference by using the power and wealth you have accumulated.
574	I believe it is important to focus on personal pursuits first, such as getting an education, obtaining a job, and climbing the ladder of success. Although this path may not lead you to proclaim your intentions to the world, you can still help people in small ways by donating your time and resources. However, if you ever achieve a position of power, you have the potential to make significant contributions to the common good.
575	Being in the police academy can be very demanding and stressful. Were you supportive when he was there? I don't want to be disrespectful to you, but it sounds like you may have been the one being selfish. Were you being super demanding on him then? Maybe I'm missing part of the story.  You should be glad that he was bettering himself and furthering his career. I'd say if that was the only issue that caused your break-up, then yes, get back with him.

580	The sheriff's department does not have sales. They are not in the business of being creditors/liquidators/repossessors, nor are they salesmen. When a debt expires, collection agencies become much more aggressive in their attempts to collect. The only thing the sheriff's department can do is allow a party to collect cars, or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
581	The sheriff's department does not offer sales. They are not in the business of being creditors, liquidators, or repossessors, nor are they salesmen. They may attempt to intimidate you (harassment), but they are only acting upon laws. When a debt expires, collection agencies become much more aggressive in their efforts to collect. The only thing a sheriff's department can do is allow a party to collect cars, etc., or ensure a safe and legal eviction.

Furthermore, they do not engage in harassing debtors, which is against the law. When a debt expires, collection agencies become much more aggressive in their attempts to collect. The sheriff's department can only assist with the collection of cars and other such items, or ensure a safe and legal eviction.
584	The sheriff's department is not in the business of being creditors, liquidators, or repossessors, nor are they salesmen. They are merely bluffing you (harassment), but according to the law, they have the right to allow a party to collect cars, or to ensure a safe and legal eviction.
585	No one objects when those who have committed crimes are extradited...justice should be served even if criminals flee. However, we all know that accusations are often made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial elsewhere are going to want to be pretty well convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.

However, we all know that accusations are often made against innocent people, and that not all legal systems are the same in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them who face trial in another place are going to want to be quite convinced that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
589	Whenever criminals are accused of a crime, they are often extradited to face justice. This is only fair, as innocent people should not be punished for crimes they did not commit. Unfortunately, the legal systems of different countries are not always equal in terms of fairness. It is only natural that courts that have the accused before them will want to be sure that there is a solid case to answer before they send them abroad.
590	It wasn't just the Jews, honey.  The Nazis weren't motivated by hate, like Stalin.  They were acting in accordance with their own twisted vision of what was best for the world.  "The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions".  They wanted a master race, and sadly, Jews, and other minorities did not fit that criteria.  They did whatever they could to accomplish their dream.  They weren't exactly hating the people.  They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions.  We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily.  That's what the Nazis did to various people groups.  Stalin, on the other hand, was simply a tyrant who used any means necessary to stay in power, enforcing his own "Harvest of Despair".

595	The vast majority of the answers above make the same mistake that the question implies.  It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the "freedom of religion" right is not the issue.   The issue is the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..." As interpreted, that basically means that religious reasons cannot be used to justify secular laws.   Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion.  It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law.

600	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as there are a lot of Clinton era hold-overs still in place.    Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
601	Answer is NO! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as there are a lot of Clinton-era holdovers in the current administration.   Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush and hindering the war effort, so they will do whatever it takes to distort the truth and hide behind freedom of the press.

602	Answer is no! However, I think the bigger problem is finding out who leaks this information, as there are likely a lot of Clinton-era holdovers still in government who are uncomfortable with the new administration's approach.  Newspapers are in the business of bashing Bush, so they will do whatever it takes to hinder the war effort, and then hide behind freedom of the press. It is getting people killed, and prolonging the war by telling our enemy everything they need to know.
603	No, I do not think that newspapers are a major source of leaked information. I think the bigger issue is finding out who is leaking this information. There are likely many Clinton-era holdovers still in government who are disgruntled with the current administration and are trying to undermine the war effort. Furthermore, news organizations are in the business of criticizing the president and making money, so they will do whatever it takes to hurt the war effort and then hide behind freedom of the press. This is unacceptable and is getting people needlessly killed.
604	No, I do not believe that newspapers should be allowed to publish classified information that could potentially jeopardize national security and put lives at risk. It is unfair to the troops who are fighting the war and to the public that relies on the government to keep them safe. Furthermore, I think that the bigger problem is finding out who is responsible for leaking this information. There are still many Clinton-era holdovers who have access to sensitive material and could be the source of these leaks.
605	It's boring. A bit scary. I am not going to complain about the regular sex. Shower time could get out of hand. Seriously, it is a drag. Psychiatric wards can be scarier, but you don't necessarily have to sleep with guys if you are broke and need a smoke, lots of good looking loonies (I can say that I own that word) in the hospital and you cannot catch crazy so it is worth going for it. So, each has its pros and cons, but I would have to recommend psyche ward over jail. and jail over my last marriage. Oh, for the people that say you lose your self-respect, speak for yourselfs.

610	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs. However, if activists continue to do this, it could become costly enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it, which would not be good business practice. Additionally, this tactic has been used against private citizens, with activists waiting near public events and dousing them with either paint or something that looks like blood.
611	Yes and no; over the short term, it would cause the retailer to have to order more furs, but long term, if activists kept doing it, it could become expensive enough that the retailer would think twice about selling it -- buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice.   The same tactic has also been used against private citizens; activists would wait near big public events where they know that ritzy folks will probably walk through wearing furs and then douse them with either paint or something looking like blood.

613	Yes and no; initially, the retailer may have to order more furs to meet the demand, but if activists continue to pressure them, it could become costly and the retailer may choose to stop selling furs in order to avoid the negative publicity. Buying merchandise you can't sell is not good business practice.  Similar tactics have also been used against private citizens; activists will wait near large public events where they know wealthy people will be wearing furs, and then douse them with either paint or something that looks like blood.
614	Yes and no; initially, it would cause the retailer to need to purchase more furs. However, if activists kept up the pressure, it could become costly enough that the retailer would be discouraged from selling them in the long run - buying merchandise you can't sell isn't good business practice. This same tactic has also been used against private citizens, where activists wait near high-profile events and douse them with either paint or something that looks like blood, making them look bad in the public eye.
615	After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs. Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months. I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient. I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?

620	The smaller the political unit, the more control the people have. The best size political unit is the city: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects), small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption of big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well governed Norway is with 5 million people. Look how badly China is governed with 1,351 million. I argue that the larger the group, the harder it is to govern with good ideals. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements the way Europe is.
621	The smaller the political unit, the more control the people have. A city is the best size: big enough to have the advantages of scale (pooling risk, working together on public projects) but small enough to avoid the disadvantages (corruption from big money, large inefficient bureaucracy). Look at how well Norway is governed with 5 million people, and contrast it with China's poor governance with 1.35 billion people. To ensure good governance, we should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, such as Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements, similar to those in Europe.
622	The smaller the political unit, the more control the people should have. A city is the ideal size: big enough to allow for collective risk-sharing and public projects, but small enough to avoid corruption and inefficiency caused by large amounts of money and bureaucracy. Look at how well Norway is governed with its 5 million people, compared to China's 1,351 million inhabitants, which is too large to be effectively governed. This is proof that smaller groups are easier to manage with good intentions. We should therefore invoke Article V of the Constitution and divide the United States into smaller, independent countries, such as Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These countries could be linked together through free trade and mutual defense pacts, like Europe is today.
623	The smaller the political unit, the more control the people have. The best size unit is the city: large enough to benefit from economies of scale, while still being small enough to avoid the drawbacks of larger units such as corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. Look at Norway, with its 5 million people, and compare it to China, with its 1.35 billion. This illustrates that smaller groups are easier to govern with good principles. We should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the United States into several independent countries, for instance: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements, just like Europe.
624	The smaller the political unit, the more the people have control. The best size unit is the city, which has the advantages of scale (pooling risk, jointly working on public projects) without the disadvantages of large, inefficient bureaucracies and corruption of big money. Look at how well Norway is governed with 5 million people compared to China with 1,351 million! This shows that smaller groups are easier to govern with good ideals. Therefore, we should invoke Article V of the Constitution and partition the US into several independent countries, such as: Cascadia, Texas, California, Heartland, New England, Florida, and the Confederacy. These could be linked together with trade and mutual defense agreements, as is done in Europe.
625	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more. When the 'fingerstache' meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a 'fingerstache' might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their 'hipster' (or should I say 'Hitler') tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that America's rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the 'hipster' that can only be filled with 'fingerstache' pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Each moustache that sprouts from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, a black, hairy, evil flag.
626	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches have not been seen as reliable, owing to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more. When the fingerstache meme first became popular, I was horrified, as the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards mankind. To me, anybody that sports a fingerstache is virtually proclaiming their secret desire to revert to barbarism and impose their hipster (or should I say "Nazi") tastes and preferences on society by force.

630	The schools are teaching kids helplessness, which only causes the true victims of the school to suffer at the hands of administration. The "Stop Bullying" campaign is merely propaganda that keeps kids from recognizing themselves as autonomous beings and is a key reason why there are more school shootings. When you back an animal into a corner, it will strike with full force. That is what the school system and laws in place do. I also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who can't solve problems on their own.
631	The schools are teaching kids to give up their power and accept victimhood. This only serves to cause more suffering for the true victims of the school's authoritarian policies. The "Stop Bullying" campaign is a propaganda tool designed to keep kids from recognizing their own freedom and autonomy, and is a major factor in the rise of school shootings. When an animal is cornered, it will lash out with all its might. That is exactly what these oppressive systems do to the young people they are meant to protect. I also believe these laws are denying young people the chance to develop the skills needed to solve their own problems and take responsibility for their lives.
632	The schools are teaching kids helplessness, which only serves to victimize the true autonomy-seeking students and is a major contributing factor to the increase in school shootings.

635	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God, is quite possibly the least morally defensible concept I can imagine. If true, this view would cause an unimaginable amount of suffering, on a scale far greater than any that all of humanity combined has ever been capable of creating.

The scale of suffering and torture it would cause would be unparalleled - billions of people, forever, suffering such unimaginable horrors. Humanity could never compare to such an atrocity.

Even dictators who have caused untold suffering in this world pales in comparison to the amount of suffering this view of hell would cause. We are talking about an unimaginable amount of billions of people being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing can compare to this horror.

639	The notion of hell, as traditionally argued and defended by evangelicals and fundamentalists of both Islam and Christianity, either as a permanent flaming realm of torture or metaphysical torment and specifically designed for non-adherents for the 'crime' of being unsaved or for not believing in God or believing in the wrong God, is truly one of the least morally defensible concepts I can imagine. Such a view causes immense suffering and agony for billions of people. No human atrocity can compare to the potential effects of this view, if true.
640	People will always hold their opinions about religion, regardless of what. Because, they were raised that way.  The religious individual claims, "God is here. I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." The atheist responds, "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence."  And we're back to square one...
641	People will always hold their opinions on religion, regardless of what they were taught. The religious person says, “God is here. I don’t know how or why, but he is here and we must obey.” The atheist responds, “God is impossible. It defies science. It’s a bizarre thought with no evidence.” And the debate continues, with no definitive answer.
642	People will always have their own opinions about religion, regardless of their upbringing. The religious person might say, "God is here. I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." The atheist might counter, "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." And the debate continues.

I don't know how or why, but he is here and we must obey." The atheist counters, "God is impossible. It defies science. It's a bizarre thought with no evidence." And the discussion continues.
644	People will always have their opinions about religion, regardless of what they were raised with. Because, they were brought up to believe either that "God is here" or that "God is impossible" and therefore must be obeyed or disbelieved. This is an ongoing argument that will never be resolved, despite both sides' efforts.
645	I do not believe the world will end in 2012, as NASA has been searching and it has been over 3,000 years since the last major extinction event. My friend and I made a bet that if the world does not end, I get $5 and he has to pay up. He said that if we see the asteroids, he has to pay up. I can't wait to collect my $5! LOL. The Master Chief.
646	I doubt the world will end anytime soon. NASA has been searching for possible threats to Earth for decades, and they haven't detected anything that might be a concern. Even so, I think it's still wise to be prepared for any eventuality. So I think it was wise of your friend to make a bet with you - either way, you win!
647	NASA keeps searching and we won't be hit for another 3,000 years, according to predictions. It's funny because I made a bet with my friend that the world won't end in 2012. If it does, he gets $5 and I have to pay up. He said, "If we see the asteroids, I get to collect the $5". I can't wait to pay up! LOL!
648	NASA continues to search for potentially threatening asteroids and meteors, and we will not be impacted for the next three thousand years. I'm still waiting for my friend to pay up on our bet that the world won't end in 2012; if it does, he owes me five dollars. He said he'll pay if we see any asteroids, so I'm looking forward to that! LOL.
649	I doubt the world will end in 2012, as NASA has been searching for possible asteroids and meteoroids for several thousand years and has not found any signs of an imminent collision. My friend and I made a bet with this conclusion: if the world does not end in 2012, I get $5, and if it does, he gets $5. He said if we do see any asteroids or meteors, then I have to pay up. I'm looking forward to that $5! My name is The Master Chief.
650	The buffet's portion sizes are impressive. There is more care put into the food than in other places. Service was friendly, but it was difficult to get their attention later on in the meal when we wanted a Sprite. The New York Steak was amazing and the miso shrimp salad was delicious. I would like to come back to try out the dinner menu.
651	I had a great experience at this buffet. There was more attention to the food than at other places, and the service was pleasant and attentive. The New York Steak was cooked well and the miso shrimp salad was delicious. I would like to come back to try the dinner selection.
652	The concept of individual portions at this place is great. There is more attention to the actual food than you would find in other buffets. Service was friendly, although it became a bit difficult to find them when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. The New York Steak was cooked nicely for a buffet, and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I'd like to come back to experience the dinner menu, as we visited during brunch.
653	The buffet's portion sizes were excellent and more attentive to the food than in other places. The service was polite, although it became a bit difficult to ask for Sprite later on in the meal. The New York Steak was good and I enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I look forward to coming back for dinner to try it out.
654	I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant's portions. There was certainly more focus on the food than at other buffets I've tried. The service was pleasant, although it became a bit difficult to find our server later in the meal when we wanted a refill of soda. The New York Steak was excellent for a buffet and I especially enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I'd like to come back and try dinner here.
655	Raising Cane's is a tasty choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than large enough to more than fill me up. It's a bit pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and quick at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner.

And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a great option for lunch or dinner.
657	Raising Cane's is a tasty choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as an added bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or coleslaw (depending which size meal you choose) included. Personally, I always get the 3-finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) since it is more than enough to fill me up. It's a bit more expensive than expected, but reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually quick and hassle-free. All in all, a great fast food option for lunch or dinner.
658	Raising Cane's is an excellent choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their signature dipping sauce is delectable. And, as an added bonus, you get a slice of toast and/or coleslaw (depending on which size meal you select) - a great value for your money. I always go for the 3-finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries and toast) as it's perfectly portioned for me. It's slightly pricier than I expected, but reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and efficient at this location. The drive-thru line moves quickly. Overall, a great fast food restaurant for lunch or dinner.
659	Raising Cane's is an excellent choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a slice of toast and/or coleslaw (depending on which size meal you choose) — all of which are more than enough for a satisfying meal. It may cost a bit more than expected, but it is certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and efficient. The drive-thru is generally quick and efficient. All in all, a great fast food spot for lunch or dinner.
660	The pizza was satisfactory, and it was priced reasonably at $9.99 for a medium pizza. After you place your order, the cashier swings the touch screen display around so that you can enter your payment information and select whether or not to leave a tip. I would expect that for to-go orders, there would be no tip asked for at all.  The restaurant had a good sanitation score of 97.5, and it stated on their wall that the pizza would take around 9 minutes, which it ended up actually taking 28 minutes.
661	The pizza was satisfactory and the price was reasonable at $9.99 for a medium pizza. When paying, they swung the touch screen display around so you could enter your information and confirm the order total and whether or not to leave a tip. I would expect that for take-out orders, there should not be a tip requested at all.   Their sanitation score was a respectable 97.5 and the pizza took around 28 minutes, which is reasonable for a new place.
662	I found the pizza to be decent. It was priced at $9.99 for a medium pizza, and they swung the touch screen display around so you could pay after they swiped your card, displaying the order total and the option to leave a tip, which you had to hit "no" to and sign. For take-out orders, I would expect them to skip this altogether.    They had a score of 97.5 on their sanitation grade, which is quite good. However, it took them 28 minutes to make the pizza, which is quite slow. Overall, I think they need to work on the speed of their delivery.
663	The pizza was decent and the price was reasonable, with no tip required. They offered touch screen payment which displayed the order total and allowed you to cancel the tip option before signing. Unfortunately, it took 28 minutes for the order to arrive, which was a bit of a wait, despite their high sanitation score of 97.5. There was no menu available on paper or chalkboard, and it was difficult to judge the quality of the pizza without this.
664	I found the pizza to be satisfactory. The price for a medium pizza was $9.99, which I thought was reasonable. When paying, they swung the touch screen display around so you could enter your information and decide if you wanted to leave a tip before signing. For take-out orders, I think it would be appropriate to simply list the total cost and not request a tip.    The pizza took 28 minutes to prepare, which was much longer than the 9 minutes they had estimated. This was surprising, as the sanitation score was a respectable 97.5. I would have expected higher standards from a new establishment.
665	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's three children are in, have implemented school uniforms. One purported benefit is to reduce bullying, which does not address the issue at hand. Uniforms get rid of or mitigate students being bullied for not wearing a certain fashion label that they dictate is "in". While this is a problem, it simply passes the buck and does not address the fact that kids will find other reasons to bully their peers. Additionally, uniforms infringe upon students' basic rights to be individuals and express themselves.
666	My mother works at a school and my cousin's three children attend a school district that both mandate school uniforms. Despite this policy supposedly being implemented to reduce bullying, it fails to address the root of the issue. Furthermore, it merely pushes the problem under the rug by targeting one type of bullying while infringing on students' basic rights to express themselves and be individuals.
667	My mother works at a school that has implemented school uniforms, in part to reduce bullying. In reality, this does not address the problem, as it only gets rid of or reduces students being bullied for not wearing a specific clothing label that is being dictated as the "in" thing to wear. This type of bullying is still prevalent, and children will find other reasons to harass their peers. Furthermore, it infringes upon a student's basic rights to be an individual and express themselves through their clothing choices.
668	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's three children are in, have implemented school uniforms. One supposed benefit is that it reduces bullying, however this does not address the issue. It only eliminates or reduces student suffering due to not wearing the specific clothing labels that the school dictates are the "in thing". Furthermore, it infringes on students' rights to express themselves and be individuals. Kids will find other reasons to bully others, so this solution does not solve the problem.
669	My mother's school and my cousin's children's school have recently implemented school uniforms in an attempt to reduce bullying. However, this does not address the root of the issue and is a Band-Aid solution at best. It simply moves the focus of bullying from one area to another. Furthermore, it violates a student's right to express themselves and be an individual.
670	I believe that books are superior to TV, since most of the TV children watch is filled with inappropriate content that can adversely influence them. Additionally, many parents are not mindful of what their children are watching on TV, while books offer greater opportunities for self-improvement and knowledge acquisition.
671	Books are better than TV because most TV content is inappropriate for children and can have a negative influence on them. Furthermore, many parents are unaware of what their children are watching and are therefore unable to monitor the content that their children are exposed to. On the other hand, books allow children to learn more, as they provide a better platform to acquire knowledge and develop critical thinking skills.
672	I believe books are more beneficial than TV for several reasons. First, the content that is shown on TV tends to be heavily mediated and often not suitable for children. Moreover, parents tend to be less vigilant about what their children are watching on TV compared to what they are reading. Furthermore, reading offers a unique opportunity to learn, as the information is absorbed in a deeper way and can be used to stimulate critical thought.
673	Books are better than TV because most of the content on TV is inappropriate for children and may influence them negatively. Parents often do not supervise the content their children are watching, which is a concern. Books, on the other hand, teach children valuable lessons and allow them to develop their knowledge and skills. Furthermore, books offer more intellectually stimulating content than TV shows.
674	Books are better than TV because most of the content on TV can be inappropriate and potentially harmful to kids, while books provide an educational and more wholesome experience. Parents should be more aware of what their children are watching on TV, and I believe books are the better option because they offer more to gain in terms of knowledge and understanding.
675	If I had a father who didn't provide any emotional or financial support, I would probably feel resentful and abandoned. Regardless of what the future may hold, the absence of a strong relationship now would likely lead to further strain and distance over time. Therefore, it is best to make an effort to establish and maintain meaningful connections with those who are important to us.
676	I think if I had a father who did nothing for me, I would not want him around. Given the likely estrangement in five years' time, any attempt to reconcile seems futile.
677	If I had a father who did nothing for me, I would not want him around as a constant reminder of what I cannot have. Given that the outcome is likely to be the same five years down the line, why try to make it work if you already know what the outcome will be?
678	If I had a father who did not support me and made no effort to build a relationship with me, I would be unlikely to want him in my life in the future, as the odds are that our relationship will not improve over time. Therefore, I do not think it worthwhile to make the effort if I already know the outcome.
679	I think if I had a father who did nothing for me, I would not want him around, as the chances are that you and him will not be speaking in five years' time, anyway. Thus, why try to make it work out if you already know the outcome?
680	If two people are in a relationship, then yes, pornography is wrong. No one has the right to dictate what is appropriate behavior for others. Pornography exploits both men and women and is not realistic, which can potentially lead to relationships being harmed. Out of respect and love, a couple should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their partner.
681	If two people are in a loving relationship, then pornography is wrong. Everyone has the right to offer their opinion, but it is important to be respectful. Pornography exploits its subjects, and it is not a healthy or realistic way to satisfy one's sexual desires. It can also lead to relationships falling apart.
682	If one is in a relationship, then yes, pornography is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, but we can strive to influence each other in positive ways. Pornography is exploitative of both men and women, and is not realistic, which can easily lead to relationship discord. If a man and a woman, or a woman and a woman, or a man and a man, are in a relationship, then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love and respect.
683	If one is in a relationship, then yes, pornography is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, but we can try to influence each other in a positive way. Pornography exploits men, women, and couples, and it is not realistic or healthy for relationships. It can lead to serious trust issues, and it's not fair to the people involved in the films. Seriously, it's disgusting. Out of love and respect for each other, those in a relationship should seek to satisfy each other sexually only through their spouse.
684	If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship, then they should prioritize their partner and be faithful. Out of love and respect, they should not look for gratification outside of the relationship. Pornography exploits individuals and can be damaging to relationships. It is not realistic and can create unnecessary rifts between partners. It is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.
685	In the United States of America, upholding a woman's right to choose is the most effective and constitutional way to go. In other countries, people will make their own decisions regarding reproductive rights.
686	In the United States of America, advocating for a woman's right to choose is the most effective way to ensure reproductive freedom. Elsewhere in the world, people should have the right to make their own decisions regarding reproductive rights.
687	In the United States of America, pro-choice should be protected by the Constitution. Elsewhere in the world, people should be allowed to make their own decisions.
688	In the United States of America, upholding the right to choose is the only constitutional approach. In other parts of the world, people will make their own decisions.
689	In the United States of America, protecting the right to choose is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions.
690	Having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all, because growing up without a father can be difficult for some children. For instance, there are some kids who need fathers to teach them right from wrong, but at least with a father, even if he is lousy, there is somebody to support your decisions and provide encouragement.
691	Having a father, even an imperfect one, is better than being fatherless. Growing up without a father can be difficult for some children, as they need fathers to teach them right from wrong. Even if a child's father is not ideal, he or she will still have somebody to support their decisions and encourage their growth.
692	Having a father, no matter how lousy he may be, is better than being fatherless, as it offers children security, guidance and support. Without a father to provide a moral compass, some children may be more likely to make poor decisions or lack the necessary support to thrive. As such, it is better to have a lousy father than none at all.
693	Having a lousy father is certainly better than having no father at all, as growing up without a father can be difficult for some children. For instance, there are some children who need fathers to teach them right from wrong, but at least with a father, no matter how bad he may be, you still have someone to support your decisions and offer encouragement.
694	I believe it is preferable to have an imperfect father than to be fatherless, as this can offer children important support and guidance. For instance, some children need fathers to instruct them on right and wrong choices, but at least with a father, however imperfect, there is someone to provide guidance, affirmation, and encouragement.
695	I firmly believe that the consumption of water bottles should be limited and discouraged, as they can pose a significant threat to the environment and our health. Plastic bottles take hundreds of years to degrade and leach chemicals into the environment, and are rarely recycled. Additionally, the water inside is usually tap water that has not been treated, and thus is not safe to drink. In comparison, safe and clean drinking water can be easily found from nature, such as from leaves, moss, and cleanser. Nearly one in five tested water bottles also have bacteria, indicating that their safety cannot be guaranteed.
696	I believe that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere, unless in the case of an emergency. Plastic bottles can leak toxic chemicals after a certain amount of time, which can be damaging to the environment. Also, most water bottles are not recycled, and end up in landfills, causing pollution. Furthermore, the cost of the bottle is high, and it takes 700 years to start to decompose. It is also important to note that tap water is usually tested, and can be cleaned with moss and leaves. One in five tested water bottles had bacteria on them, showing how risky the use of water bottles can be.
697	I believe that the consumption of plastic bottles should not be allowed anywhere, since they often contain chemicals that can leak over time, have a tendency to never be recycled, and end up in landfills, causing pollution of our environment. Furthermore, the cost of the bottle itself typically accounts for about 700 years of decomposition, while the water contained within is usually just tap water that could easily be filtered or purified using natural materials such as leaves, moss, or water cleanser. In addition, one in five tested water bottles have been found to contain bacteria, making the use of plastic bottles an unsafe and unwise choice.
698	I believe that the consumption of water bottles should not be encouraged, as they pose potential harm to the environment. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time, and they are almost never recycled, leading to pollution of our environment. Furthermore, the cost of a bottle of water is too high in comparison to the tap water inside it, and the water is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, it can easily be filtered through leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Additionally, nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria, making it an unwise choice for drinking.
699	I believe that drinking water from plastic bottles should not be allowed anywhere, as they can leak hazardous chemicals after a certain amount of time and often end up in landfills, which pollute our environment. Furthermore, research has shown that the water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is considered dirty, this can easily be remedied with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser. Moreover, nearly one in five tested water bottles have bacteria, so there is an increased health risk associated with their use. Therefore, I strongly believe that consumption of water bottles should be limited and regulated.
700	Books offer a source of entertainment, as well as education. For those who are illiterate, listening to audiobooks can provide an effective means of receiving knowledge
701	Because it is a source of entertainment, as well as providing an educational service to those who cannot read.
702	Because it is a source of entertainment as well as a practical tool for those who cannot read.  It can also be used for communication, education, and information
703	Because it is a source of entertainment as well as providing an educational service to those who cannot read.
704	Because it is a source of entertainment, as well as helping those who cannot read.
705	I understand why people might believe in God, as it requires faith and not proof. However, I do not share this belief. The idea of God is false according to my beliefs, and I do not need to change these beliefs if you disagree. Both sides contradict each other's beliefs, and no one will win this debate until the end. I support Christianity because of my beliefs, and your proof that God does not exist does not change my case or turn it the other way around.
706	I agree that believing in God is a matter of faith, and I do not need proof to validate my beliefs. As you said, both sides contradict each other, and no one will win until the end. However, I still support Christianity because of my faith in God, and your proof that He does not exist does not sway my opinion.
707	It is clear that we have differing beliefs. I believe in God and take that on faith. You believe that God does not exist and have presented your own evidence to back that up. We won't change each other's minds, but I still support Christianity as I have faith in God. You may present your proof that God does not exist, but it will not change the case or turn it the other way around. Ultimately, this is a fight between two armies that neither will win until the end.
708	I have faith in God and thus I do not need to provide any proof. The idea of God being false is your own words and I will not be swayed by your atheistic beliefs. Both sides contradict each other, but neither side will ultimately win. This is likely a conflict between two armies that will remain unresolved. I support Christianity based on my personal faith in God, and your proof of God's nonexistence does not shake that faith in the least.
709	I find faith in God to be a powerful and personal thing. Despite your belief that God does not exist, I will continue to support Christianity because of my own faith. Your proof that God does not exist does not change my views or turn the situation around. This is a conflict between two beliefs that will probably never end. Both sides contradict each other, but neither will emerge victorious until the end.
710	I'm not a Christian, but if you are one, you shouldn't try to argue with them on any subject unless your argument is based on the same idea. Sort of like street fighting and UFC; different platforms.
711	As a Christian, I would argue that one's faith is a personal matter and should not be judged, especially when it comes to debating different topics. To me, debating is like mixed martial arts fighting; different platforms are best suited for different situations.
712	I'm not a Christian, but if you are, you can't really argue against them if your argument is on the same subject. It's like street fighting and the UFC - two different platforms.
713	I'm not a Christian, but if you are, you shouldn't try to argue with them on any subject, since it's unlikely that you'll be able to find a basis for comparison. It's like two street fighters in an Ultimate Fighting Championship ring - they have two completely different platforms to base their argument on.
714	I'm not a Christian, but if you are a Christian, you should be cautious when debating them, as the chances of getting the better of them are slim. It's like street fighting and UFC; two different platforms with different rules and strategies.
715	It should be optional, but preferably made a requirement, with some leeway as to how often it is implemented. How would you expect a child to be physically fit if they are not well? Separating boys and girls for games would be beneficial, with boys being assigned some good physical activities, same thing for girls, giving them appropriate games and activities for each gender.
716	It should not be mandatory, but at least a requirement. How would you consider PE if the child is not in good health? Separating boys and girls for PE activities would be beneficial, as boys could play some good games of physical education activity, as well as girls, who could be assigned activities appropriate for them.
717	It should be optional, but preferably made a requirement. How would you consider PE if the child is not in good health? And if possible, separate boys and girls, with boys being given good physical games for physical education activities, same thing with girls, giving them games for girls ideas.
718	PE should be optional, but at least a requirement. How would you consider PE if the child is not so well? And if possible, separate boys from girls, for boys to play some good games of physical education activities, same with girls, give them games for girls ideas.
719	It should not be required, but at least recommended, but not more frequently. How would you feel if the child was not well? And if possible, separate boys and girls, for boys to play some good games of physical education activities, same for the girls, give them activities for girls.
720	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. According to Leviticus 20:13: “If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both committing an abomination, and they shall be put to death; their blood is on their own hands.” There’s a loving God, isn't there?
721	Laws that ban gay marriage and other policies are only enforced due to the influence of the religious right. The United States of America can only remain united if laws are enacted that are consistent for all men and women. In this way, no single religion is favored over another. Secular law is the only legal system that can effectively uphold freedom. Furthermore, the bible is filled with loving passages, such as Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands."
722	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the influence of the religious right, which threatens to divide the United States. To have a law that favors one religion over another is contrary to freedom and the pursuit of happiness. The United States must uphold laws that are applicable to all people regardless of their faith or lack thereof. The Bible is clear on this issue: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands" (Leviticus 20:13). It is clear that a loving god did not write this hateful verse.

725	People should be able to express their opinions freely, while also being respectful of each other's feelings. When someone says something offensive, those offended should be able to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. A liberal should not be ashamed to call out a conservative for "violating a person's freedom of speech," and a conservative should not be ashamed to stand by their original statement and defend it on its merits. Freedom of speech goes both ways.
726	People should have the right to express their opinions freely without fear of criticism or reprisal. When people object to offensive statements, however, it is not a violation of freedom of speech; it is a valid response that should be respected. There is no double standard when it comes to freedom of speech; both liberals and conservatives should be held to the same standard. Therefore, when a liberal objects to a conservative's offensive statement, it is not an infringement of the conservative's freedom of speech, nor should the conservative be excused for their statement. Everyone should be held accountable for their words and should respect the right of others to be offended.
727	People should be allowed to express their opinions freely, both conservatives and liberals, without fear of criticism or reprisal. If a liberal expresses an opinion that offends a conservative, the conservative has the right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. However, if a conservative expresses an opinion that offends a liberal, the liberal also has the right to object, argue, and even ask for an apology. Everyone should recognize that freedom of speech goes both ways.
728	People should be able to express their opinions freely, but other people should also have the right to object, argue, and ask for an apology if they feel offended. Both sides should be equally respected and accepted. When a liberal expresses an opinion and a conservative objects, either let it drop or defend the original statement on its merit. Neither side should be considered as more against freedom of speech than the other. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide when they have been offended enough to ask for an apology.
729	People should be able to express their views without fear of retribution, but this right should be balanced with the right of others to object, argue and ask for an apology if necessary. A liberal is within their rights to object to a conservative's statement, and conservatives should either let it drop if they feel the statement was not offensive or defend the statement on its merits if it was an opinion or fact. No one should be censored for their views, but at the same time, no one should feel they have to suffer in silence if they are offended. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide how to respond.
730	Capital punishment is an effective law enforcement tool and is used in many countries to reduce crime rates. However, it is immoral to take another person's life, regardless of the situation, as it involves an act of superiority and is not a desirable alternative. There are many other solutions that should be explored before resorting to capital punishment. It is clear that different perspectives on this issue exist, with some people considering it effective and others viewing it as immoral and inhumane.
731	Capital punishment is an effective way to reduce crime rates and it should be employed by countries that are comfortable with it. On the other hand, it is morally wrong to take a life, as it is assumed that one is in a position of superiority and every man on earth is equal. Alternatives to capital punishment should be explored, as it is not the best option in all cases. It is simply a matter of perspective, with some countries supporting it due to their Christian beliefs. The simple truth is that it is effective, but from a biased perspective, it is also barbaric, immoral, and there are better solutions, albeit not as effective.
732	Capital punishment is an effective deterrent for crime, as evidenced by the low crime rates in countries that employ it. On the other hand, taking a life is unacceptable, as it assumes a position of superiority and reduces every man to the same level. There are certainly better alternatives than capital punishment, even if they are not as effective. It is a matter of perspective, as the typical Christian perspective is against it, and this is due to the Christian country we live in. The simple truth is that it is effective, but also barbaric, immoral, and there are better solutions, although not as effective.
733	Capital punishment is a powerful deterrent to crime and should be employed in countries that are comfortable with it. On the other hand, taking a life is wrong and there are many other methods of punishment that should be tried before capital punishment. It is a powerful tool, but one that should not be used lightly. Its effectiveness must be weighed against its moral implications in each particular case. While it may be an effective tool in certain countries, in others it may not be the right choice due to moral reasons. It's important to consider all angles in order to make an informed decision.
734	Capital punishment is an effective way to reduce crime rates. This has been demonstrated by countries that have implemented it. However, it is not a viable option for every country as it is controversial and can be seen as immoral to take another person's life. Additionally, there are many other law enforcement methods that are equally effective but do not involve taking a life. It should not be the first choice of any nation. From a Christian perspective, capital punishment is seen as barbaric and immoral due to the teachings of the bible. Ultimately, it is a matter of perspective and how effective it is in reducing crime compared to the alternatives.
735	The dismissal of the case without prejudice leaves open the possibility of re-filing the lawsuit or otherwise attempting to collect the claimed debt. However, at this point you have grounds for a counter-action if they continue to pursue this claim, or make harmful statements to credit reporting agencies.  You can ask an attorney to help with a formal letter to the company advising them that you will take such action. You should include copies of any derogatory material on any credit reports, and demand that these be corrected. Separately, you should also notify the credit reporting agencies that the report is incorrect and demand a change. In this manner you protect your interests - and, if the company is foolish enough to try again, you are positioned to sue them in return and make awad.
736	The dismissal does not prevent you from refiling the lawsuit or attempting to collect the claimed debt.

740	In answer to your question, I would refute the idea that capital punishment is comparable to abortion. It is undeniable that there have been too many instances where people have been wrongfully executed. However, this does not mean that capital punishment as a whole should be abolished; rather, our judicial system should put policies in place to prevent these mistakes from occurring. In regards to unborn babies, while it is true that they have not committed any crimes, the morality of abortion is still debatable and needs to be discussed.
741	To answer your question and to refute the person who compared capital punishment to abortion:  The fact is, yes, there have been far too many instances where people have been put to death then later found innocent. Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from ever happening. But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured, and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money? If that individual feels that an innocent person deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live? Again, I believe there should be without a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.  And concerning abortion, unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.
742	In order to properly answer your question and refute the person who drew the comparison between capital punishment and abortion, it is important to consider the facts. Yes, there have been instances in which innocent people have been wrongfully executed. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, and steps must be taken to ensure that such a thing never happens again. However, if someone without a doubt has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death. This is not unfair or unjust. It is only fair that the perpetrator be punished for their crime, and to allow them to live while innocent people have to suffer is not reasonable. Moreover, abortion is the destruction of an unborn baby, who has not committed any crime. Therefore, the two practices are not comparable.

Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.  And concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.

745	IC Systems is likely liable for the unauthorized withdrawal, but it may be difficult to pursue them in court.  To ensure it does not happen again, you should change your bank account number immediately and notify the company that you have done so.  Additionally, you should inform the company that you are reducing the amount owed by the fees they have cost you.  Finally, send a letter to IC Systems informing them that you are disputing the charges and will be stopping payment until the dispute is resolved.  If IC Systems continues to pursue you, refer to this letter and the dispute will be legitimate.
746	IC Systems is legally responsible for the debt, but it may be difficult to collect given the cost of litigation in small claims court.  My advice is to change your bank account number immediately to prevent further unauthorized withdrawals. Additionally, you should inform them that you are reducing the amount owed by the fees they have charged you, and continue to pay until there is only $120 left. When they continue to pursue payment, you can refer to the letter and point out that you have a valid dispute.
747	IC Systems is likely liable for the unauthorized debit, however, you would likely need to file a claim in small claims court to seek compensation. To prevent further unauthorized withdrawals, you should immediately change your bank account number. In addition, you should inform IC Systems of the fee of $120 that they have cost you. Once the account balance is lower than $120, you should stop making payments until the issue is resolved. If the company continues to pursue the payment, you should refer to the letter and let them know that you have a valid dispute.
748	Technically IC Systems is liable, but you would likely have to file a case in small claims court in order to make them pay.   I suggest that you change your bank account number right away so that they cannot access it anymore.  Additionally, you should inform them that you are reducing the amount you owe by the $120 in fees they have cost you. Pay the account down until there is only $120 left. Then stop paying. If they continue to pursue you, refer to the aforementioned letter and make clear that there is a legitimate dispute.
749	IC Systems is potentially liable, but you would likely need to take the matter to small claims court in order to enforce any sort of payment.    My advice to you is to immediately change your bank account number to prevent future unauthorized withdrawals.  (This is the only dependable way to stop unwanted ACH transfers.)  Additionally, it would be prudent to set up alternative payment arrangements with the company and inform them of the changed account number.  While these measures are being taken, you should also inform the company of the $120 in fees they have cost you and reduce the amount of the debt by that amount.  Once this is done, you should only owe the company $120.  If they continue to pursue payment, you can refer to the above measures and point out the valid dispute.
750	No, that's when we need those freedoms the most. We must be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of being imprisoned. Even if I disagree with someone else's opinions, I will fight to the death to make sure that they can voice those opinions.
751	I absolutely reject any limitations on freedom of speech and expression. We need to be able to express our dissenting opinions without fear of punishment or imprisonment. I may not agree with other people's views, but I will fiercely defend their right to express those opinions.

754	I strongly disagree. That is when we need those freedoms the most.  We need to be able to say that "I don't like the way the administration is handling things" without fear of persecution.   I may not agree with someone else's opinions, but I'll fight to the death to ensure that everyone is able to express their views.
755	If we are speaking in the realm of ethics, you should be notified of any medications taken by the child... Legally, if this juvenile center is treating your child for any sort of mental illness, they do not have to notify you if he/she is older than 12.  I also believe that since the child is a ward of the state due to his/her incarceration, the state does not have to notify you of any new charges or pending charges.
756	From an ethical standpoint, parents should be notified of any medications taken by their child. Legally, if the juvenile center is treating the child for any kind of mental illness, they are not required to notify the parents if the child is older than 12.

760	If the daughter is 19 and competent, then all records should be hers, not anyone else's. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed and the daughter has not previously tried to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders' documents. You should consult a lawyer in this matter.
761	If the daughter is 19 years old and competent at the time, then all records should be hers, and nobody else's. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed, and the daughter hasn't made previous attempts to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders' documents. You should consult a lawyer for advice.
762	If the daughter is 19 years old and capable, then the documents should be hers alone. If any records have been stolen, then the document holders could be liable. If too much time has passed, and the daughter hasn't attempted to claim the documents, then they will be assumed to be the holders' property. Legal advice should be sought.
763	If the daughter is 19 and capable, then she should have full ownership of the documents. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If years have passed and the daughter has not made prior attempts to claim the documents, they will be presumed to be the holders' documents. A lawyer should be consulted.
764	If the daughter is 19 years old and deemed competent by the court, then all records should be considered hers, without any further question. Depending on how much time has passed, the document holders could be charged with theft. If the daughter has not made previous attempts to claim the documents, then the documents should be considered hers without any further doubt. You should definitely involve a lawyer in this matter.
765	It has been established by many people, though some remain skeptical for various reasons. These reasons are primarily grounded in faith, as they trust in the government and refuse to believe that their country could commit the heinous act of murdering its own citizens. Ultimately, those unconvinced will awaken during a state of emergency, with curfews imposed and citizens becoming prisoners in their own homes.  The less fortunate will be imprisoned in the 600+ concentration camps already constructed around the nation and staffed, ready for their arrival.
766	It has been established in the minds of many people, but there are some who remain unconvinced, for various reasons. These are primarily based on faith, as they trust in the government and are unwilling to accept that their nation could kill its own citizens. Eventually, all will come to accept this truth: when the country is under Martial law, with curfews in place and people imprisoned in their own homes.  For the lucky few, this will be a wake-up call. For the less fortunate, it will be a sentence to one of the 600+ concentration camps scattered around the country and already staffed and ready for their arrival.
767	It has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly based on faith in the government, and a refusal to accept that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. It is likely that these individuals will come around when the country is under Martial law, with curfews in place, rendering citizens prisoners in their own homes. The less fortunate will be imprisoned in the 600+ concentration camps which have been built around the country and are already manned and waiting for their arrival.
768	It has been proven to the satisfaction of many people, but there are some that are extremely hard to convince, for a variety of reasons. These reasons are mainly faith based, in that they have faith in the government, and do not want to believe that their government could murder three thousand of its own citizens. They will all wake up in due time, probably when the country is under Martial law, with curfews imposed, and they become prisoners in their own house. That's for the lucky ones of course. The less lucky will become prisoners in the 600 or so concentration camps which have been built around the country, and are already manned and waiting for their presence.
769	It has been widely accepted by many people, but there are some who remain unconvinced, usually due to their faith in the government. These people may be in for a rude awakening in the future. If the country ever enters a state of Martial law, with curfews in place and people confined to their homes, it will be too late for the lucky ones. The less fortunate will have to face the horrors of the 600+ concentration camps already constructed around the country, where they will be imprisoned.
770	Do you mean "employee" and what is "wrongful dismissal"? In most states, employment is at-will, which means an employer can dismiss an employee at anytime for any reason or no reason at all. Just because you don't like the reason they gave doesn't mean you have an action against them for firing you.  However, there are restrictions. Employees cannot be fired because they are a member of a protected class (i.e. age, race, gender, disability). They cannot be fired, for example, if they were whistleblowers in most states.   SEEK ATTORNEY ADVICE to see if you have an employment discrimination or unlawful termination claim. Most plaintiffs' lawyers who handle employment work will have an initial consultation with you for free and will take your case on a "Contingency" so you don't have to pay for legal fees unless you win your case. Contact your local bar association for a reference.

775	I like very much the way you started: ALL RISE! However, I do not trust "god" as I find it highly unlikely that a deity would speak directly to individuals, as these leaders often claim. For example, whenever someone attacks another, in the last 16 centuries, they have claimed that god ordered them to do that! Last, but not without importance, was the Bush claim for America's and her allies to invade Iraq.
776	I concur with your opinion that there is no perfect legal system. Moreover, I am not a believer in "God" due to the lack of proof and the suspicious claims made by religious leaders that they are directed by God. For example, whenever someone commits an atrocity, they cite God's order as justification. Lastly, Bush's claim that God instructed him to invade Iraq was extremely concerning.
777	I fully agree with the sentiment of your start: "ALL RISE!" However, I must say that I am not convinced by the idea of a perfect legal system. Moreover, I am highly suspicious of any claims that a god has made, particularly when these claims result in people attacking one another. As a recent example, we can think of George W. Bush's claim that God ordered him to invade Iraq.
778	I appreciate your opening statement of "ALL RISE!" Although I don't necessarily trust any legal system, I do believe that it is important to follow the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which you are operating. I also don't trust that any one single being (e.g. "god") has the power to dictate any particular action. In the last 16 centuries, leaders have manipulated people by claiming that god has ordered them to do certain things, such as attacking another state or nation. Finally, the Bush administration's claimed justification for the invasion of Iraq is also an example of this manipulation.  It is difficult to have faith in any system when these types of leaders and actions continue to exist.  Despite this, I still believe that some form of legal system is necessary for civilization to function.
779	I applaud your strong start: "ALL RISE!" Although I am not religious, I share your skepticism of divine intervention. For example, whenever someone commits an act of aggression, in the last 16 centuries, they have claimed that God ordered them to do so. Last, but not least, was the Bush administration's claim that God wanted the United States and its allies to invade Iraq. As you rightly point out, there is no perfect legal system, and we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of justice.
780	last time I checked, he still has the right to an attorney during his court appearance. Until then, if he can't make bail or get a bondsman, he will have to tough it out until his court date. If he hates it that much, he might learn from this experience to choose better in the future. We all have our lessons to learn, some get the hard end of the stick at times with no rhyme or reason. Unfortunately, grown up problems come with grown up consequences that are sometimes hard to fix. Sorry.
781	I understand that he still has the right to a court-appointed attorney until his court date. If he cannot make bail or get a bail bond, he will have to tough it out until then. Everyone has their lessons to learn, and some people pay a higher price for their mistakes than others. Adult problems come with adult consequences, which can be difficult to repair. I'm sorry.
782	I understand that he has the right to an attorney until his court date, and if he can't afford bail or get a bondsman, he will have to wait in jail until his court date. It can be tough to be in his situation, but that's part of life and comes with its consequences. We can't always come to his rescue, but we can try to provide comfort and guidance. Grown up problems bring grown up consequences, and sometimes those consequences can be hard to fix. I'm sorry.
783	I understand that the accused individual still has the right to a court-appointed attorney until their court date. If they cannot make bail or obtain a bondsman, then they will have to endure the situation until their court date. Everyone makes mistakes, and he might have to learn the hard way in this case. We can't always come to the rescue, even if we want to, due to the nature of life and its consequences. Grown-up problems bring grown-up consequences that are sometimes difficult to remedy. I'm sorry.
784	It is understandable that he is frustrated with the situation, but he will still have the right to a court-appointed attorney until then. If he cannot make bail or obtain a bondsman, he will have to remain in jail until his court date. He may have to face the consequences of his actions, but this is life and we cannot always come to his rescue. Grown-up problems often come with grown-up consequences that are not always easy to fix. Sorry.
785	I live near a large navy base and everyone in the community worships the military. I understand that what they are doing is brave, but it is to the point where it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college, when in reality, most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad, is viewed down upon in my community.   Not just is this in my community, but I see it on world news. The military is idolized in television, political ads, and news programs. I don't believe that members of the military are anything special and I think they shouldn't be treated as such.

Joining the military after high school is seen as more noble in my community than pursuing a college education, even though most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad is viewed down upon in my community. This same admiration of the military is reflected in television, political ads, and news programs, which devalues any opposing views. I don't believe that members of the military are anything special and I think they shouldn't be treated as such.
789	I live near a large navy base, and everyone in the community worships the military. I understand that what they are doing is brave, but it is to the point where it is viewed as more noble in my community to join the military after high school than to go to college, when in reality, most people enlisting from my school are those who didn't get into college. On the other hand, anyone who has the opinion that war is wrong and that a large military is bad, is viewed down upon in my community.   This reverence for the military is not limited to my community; it is seen around the world in television, political ads, and news programs. I don't believe that members of the military are anything special and I think they shouldn't be treated as such.
790	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical and convenient way to transfer money from one account to another. However, with the advancement of technology, debit cards have replaced paper checks, rendering them obsolete. Direct deposit is a paperless system which is more efficient and cost-effective for both employers and employees when it comes to payments. It eliminates the need for paper checks and has been adopted by many businesses and individuals. Older people, who tend to be more resistant to change, are the only ones who still use paper checks, creating unnecessary delays and inconveniences for those waiting in line behind them.
791	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical and widely-used method of transferring funds from a checking account to another. However, with today's technology (debit cards, direct deposit, etc.), the need for paper checks has become obsolete. In the workplace, employers can make direct deposit payments electronically, while outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to prefer paper checks are those who are older and have no motivation to update their payment methods or adapt to the modern world. This is causing an inconvenience to those who are used to paying with cards and prefer the speed and efficiency of electronic payments.
792	Once upon a time, paper checks were a practical and common way to transfer money from one account to another. However, with today's technology and the rise of debit cards, the need for paper checks has drastically declined. Direct deposit and digital payments have become much more popular and efficient alternatives. Outside of the workplace, only some older people still use paper checks, which causes an inconvenience to those waiting in line behind them.
793	Once upon a time, paper checks were a convenient way to transfer money from a checking account to another account. However, with today's technology (debit cards, direct deposit, etc.), the need for them has been largely replaced.   Direct deposit is a paperless, more efficient way for employers to pay their employees. Outside of the workplace, the only people who seem to use paper checks are those who are not accustomed to technology or who have no incentive to change. This can cause an inconvenience for those waiting in line behind them.   CMV.
794	Debit cards have largely replaced paper checks as a way of transferring money from a checking account to another. With the rise of direct deposit, the need for paper checks has been eliminated in most cases. Unfortunately, some people remain wedded to the outdated paper checks system, resulting in inconvenience for those who must wait behind them in line. This is especially true of older individuals who are less comfortable with modern technology.
795	In my opinion, Nascar is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anyone could stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining? I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure, their bodies can endure. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
796	I believe Nascar is not a true sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is nowhere near as entertaining as watching cars driving on the highway. I can't imagine anyone who would want to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars driving in circles. How ridiculous! I'd rather watch a cricket game any day. The drivers don't even have to be in shape, as long as they don't have high blood pressure, their bodies can withstand the strain. So why would anyone actually enjoy such a pathetic hobby?
797	In my opinion, NASCAR is not a sport and should not be considered one. First of all, it is about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anyone can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive in circles. How the hell is that entertaining? I'd rather watch a cricket game! The drivers don't even have to be in shape. As long as they don't have high blood pressure, their bodies can withstand the rigors of the race. So why does anyone like such a pathetic hobby?
798	I believe that NASCAR is not a sport and should not be considered one. Firstly, it is as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway - there is little excitement or suspense. Furthermore, it takes hours to watch and does not require any athleticism - the drivers do not need to be in shape and their bodies can endure high blood pressure. This suggests that it is not a sport and is simply a hobby. Therefore, why do people enjoy such a futile pastime?
799	In my opinion, Nascar should not be considered a sport. Firstly, it is about as exciting as watching cars drive on a highway, which is not exactly thrilling. No one can stand to sit in a stadium for hours in the sun and watch cars drive in circles, so how is this entertaining? I would much rather watch a cricket game. The drivers don't need to be in shape and their bodies can withstand high levels of adrenaline, so why does anyone enjoy this bizarre hobby?
800	I strongly oppose caging animals behind bars for human entertainment. Animals are sentient creatures, with their own needs for freedom and autonomy. Unfortunately, many people still view them as inferior, which makes such imprisonment seem acceptable. We must do better than this. F*** zoos.
801	I strongly disagree with caging animals behind bars for entertainment purposes. All animals deserve to be free and to live their lives as they please. While some people may view animals as inferior, this does not justify locking them away in zoos. It's despicable and needs to be stopped. #AnimalsRights
802	I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course, nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because, for the most part, animals are viewed as inferior and thus justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.
803	I would be in favor of that. From a personal and moral perspective, I could never support confining an animal behind bars for the entertainment of people. Animals are meant to be free and are equal members of the world's ecosystems, and this view should be respected and taken seriously. F**k zoos.
804	I would be in favor of that. My personal beliefs would never allow me to support confining an animal behind bars for the entertainment of people. Animals are meant to be free. Unfortunately, this practice is widely accepted because of the general view that animals are inferior, thus justifying their imprisonment.  This is wrong and should not be condoned.
805	As of now, Pride FC has much more diverse and talented rosters than the UFC. Pride FC has fighters from all over the world, while the UFC is primarily limited to North America. This is not an "USA vs the World" argument; it just means that there is a bigger talent pool to choose from in Pride FC. Fedor Emelianenko is only one example of many high-caliber fighters still remaining in Pride FC.
806	As of now, Pride FC has access to more talented fighters than the UFC. Pride FC has fighters from all around the world, while the UFC is mainly limited to North America. This does not constitute an "USA versus the world" argument; rather, it simply means that there is a bigger pool of talent to choose from in Pride FC. Fedor Emelianenko is just one of the many talented fighters that Pride FC has access to. Crocop and Rampage have their reasons for joining the UFC, but there are still too many great fighters left in Pride FC.
807	PrideFC has a much larger pool of talent compared to the UFC. PrideFC includes fighters from all over the world, while the UFC is primarily limited to North America. This is not an argument of “USA versus the world,” but rather that there are more good fighters still in PrideFC, such as Fedor. Crocop and Rampage have their reasons for joining the UFC, but there are still too many great fighters left in PrideFC.
808	As of now, Pride has a significantly deeper talent pool than the UFC, due to its global reach and the number of high-level fighters it can draw from. Pride has fighters from all over the world, while the UFC is largely limited to North America. This is not an "USA vs the World" argument; it simply means that there is a larger pool of talented fighters for Pride to choose from, including Fedor. Even with the influx of American and Canadian fighters, there are still too many good fighters left in Pride, such as Cro Cop and Rampage.
809	As of now, Pride has more talented fighters than the UFC. Pride has fighters from all over the world, while the UFC is limited mostly to North America. It's not an "USA vs the World" argument, just meaning there is a larger talent pool to choose from in Pride. CROCop and Rampage have their reasons for coming over (who's to say Pride didn't send them over to promote Pride in the US), but still too many good fighters are left in Pride, such as Fedor.
810	I play guitar and don't feel like I suck. I believe I am quite capable of expressing myself on the instrument. Oh yeah... AND I LOVE GUITAR HERO! It actually helps to improve dexterity and coordination as well as strength and speed.  P.S. Can people try to spell a little better at least with the titles of the debates? I mean, come on, they let you know when you've misspelled a word. Although whoever created this one spelled the word correctly. They just typed the completely wrong word.

812	I enjoy playing the guitar and don't feel that I am lacking in my abilities. In fact, I believe that Guitar Hero can help improve one's dexterity and coordination, as well as strength and speed.  P.S. Can people please spell a bit better in debate titles? Even though the creator spelled the word correctly, it is still the completely wrong word. They should at least type the correct spelling in the title to ensure accuracy.

815	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.) Additionally, gay women are more "socially acceptable," for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men. Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.

Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is "lowering himself" to a women's level.  Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor. (The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society).
817	In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is often more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men find lesbians to be incredibly attractive, since there is no man present to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)  Additionally, gay women are more socially acceptable, for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are seen as inferior to men.  Gay men, however, are discriminated against due to their traditional role being reversed; they have romantic interest in men, which is seen as a woman's trait, and thus they are "lowering themselves" to a woman's level.  Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is seen as a man's attribute, bestowing them honor.  (The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society.)

819	In a traditionally male-dominated society, male opinion is often seen as more popular than female opinion, and I think we all know that many men find lesbians to be quite attractive, since there is no man present to potentially detract from the aesthetic. (Inversely, gay men are often viewed as more “socially acceptable,” due to traditional prejudices that view women as inferior to men.) Furthermore, gay women are discriminated against less due to the social stigma associated with same-sex relationships being a “man’s” domain, making theirs a less dishonorable choice. On the other hand, gay men are discriminated against more due to their choice being seen as an act of “lower[ing] themselves” to a woman’s level. Thus, gender roles and societal expectations continue to serve as significant sources of homophobia.
820	We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses weren't very friendly, likely due to the crowd. The buffet and restaurant itself was nice and clean, but the food was just average. The quality of the food wasn't worth the $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll try a different place.
821	We had the misfortune of visiting this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, likely due to the busy atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food quality did not meet our expectations, particularly for the hefty $70+ price tag that we paid as a couple. We will definitely try another place next time we are in Vegas.
822	We came to this buffet after attending a show in the casino. The hostesses weren't overly friendly, likely due to the busy atmosphere. However, the buffet and restaurant itself were nice and clean, but the food was just average. For the price of $70+ that we paid as a couple, we were expecting better quality food. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll try another place.

825	Because your own clothes are cool and hip, and if you get to wear what you want, it's cool and hip.
826	because you should be able to express yourself by wearing what you want, which is cool.
827	Because it is cool and hip to wear whatever you want and express yourself, it is cool and hip to be able to choose what you want to wear and express yourself with it.
828	because you should get to choose what you wear and make it coolio hoolio.
829	Since you get to choose what to wear, it's coolio hoolio.
830	Who said anything about Firefox or Mozilla having anything to do with Steve Jobs or Apple? Two separate entities, not even remotely connected!  BTW, IE blows when making pages and trying to get things to look right. Firefox sticks to World Wide Web Consortium standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
831	Who said anything about Firefox and Mozilla having anything to do with Steve Jobs and Apple? Completely separate entities, with nothing in common.   BTW, Internet Explorer has always struggled with page rendering and getting things to look right, while Firefox sticks to Web Consortium standards much closer than IE ever did or will.
832	Who suggested that Mozilla or Firefox had anything to do with Steve Jobs or Apple? They are completely separate entities, with no affiliation whatsoever.   IE might have been better at making pages in the past, but Firefox adheres to Web Wide Web Consortium standards much more closely than IE ever did or will.

835	If my wife confided in me, I would not betray her trust. She put her faith and confidence in me, and I would not violate that trust. If it was a violent murder, such as an act of self-defence, I would be very angry and might even consider a divorce. But if it was a crime of passion, I would be absolutely livid and could even file a lawsuit against the perpetrator.
836	If my wife confided in me, I would not break her trust. She counted on me to provide support and help, and I would do so. I would be extremely angry and may even file for divorce depending on the type of murder, such as whether it was done in self-defence or was simply a prank gone wrong.
837	If my wife confided in me, I would be committed to maintaining her trust. She has chosen to rely on me and I would be devoted to standing by her and helping her in any way I can. If she felt betrayed, I would be equally devastated and could potentially end our relationship depending on the severity of the situation.
838	If my wife confided in me, I would do my best to honor that trust. She relies on me to be supportive and help her, and I would do my best to fulfill that expectation. I would be extremely angry and might consider divorce if she committed a violent murder, or just out of boredom or thought it would be fun.
839	If my wife confided in me, I would be duty-bound to support and help her. I would also feel a deep sense of loyalty and trust. However, I may become angry and consider a divorce if the murder was premeditated or done for fun.
840	This is not logical or sensible. No one country should lead the world; we should all start together and end together, in harmony. Everyone has their own ways of doing things, and this is just not realistic or reasonable. We should strive for cooperation and understanding, not unilateral leadership.
841	This does not make sense. No single country should be leading the world; we should all start together and end together. We are all different and have different ways, but this is not logical or fair. We should work together in unity and harmony, respecting each other's sovereignty and independence, to find solutions that are beneficial to all
842	This does not make sense for one country to lead the world. We have all been together to reach this point, and that is the way it should end. Everyone has their own ways of thinking, which is not logical in this case.
843	This does not make sense. No single country should lead the world; we all started together and that's how it should end. Everyone has their own ways and this is not logical at all.
844	This is not a sensible approach for a single country to take the world. We all began together and it should end this way too. Everyone has their own way of doing things and this is not logical in any way.
845	Having a father who is physically present but emotionally absent can cause great heartache. He might win your trust and then walk out on you, leaving you with feelings of abandonment and uncertainty. On the other hand, having a father who is completely absent, either through death or choice, can provide some security in knowing that you will not experience this pain. I believe that it is better to have a father who is completely gone than one who comes and goes in your life, never truly knowing or understanding you.
846	Having a father who is physically present but emotionally absent can still cause much pain and heartache. That father could come and go in your life with ease and without warning, causing you to never feel secure or truly known. To me, this is a far greater heartache than the mere physical absence of a father. It is better to never have known a father at all than to experience such an insecure and unfulfilling relationship.
847	Having a father who is always present, even if it means having to deal with his absence from time to time, is preferable to having a lousy father who may break your trust and walk out on you. Knowing that your father is always there is better than nothing, since either way you will at least gain something from him. To me, having a father who does nothing is even worse than never having had one, because you will never gain his wisdom and never have any memory of him. It is better to have a father who comes and goes in your life, than to never have had one at all.
848	Having a father who is present but cold and uncaring can be just as painful as never having a father at all. The heartaches of an absent father are compounded by the knowledge that he could have been there but chose not to be. Some would argue that the presence of a father, no matter how uninvolved, is better than nothing. To me, this "something" is an absence, as either way the father knows nothing about his child and the child knows nothing about the father. I would rather never have had a father than to have one who is present but disconnected.
849	Having a father who is not present could mean that you experience only the heartaches of his absence, as well as not knowing what he was like. A terrible father could come and easily gain your trust, only to walk away and leave you hurt. Some may want to believe that having a father at all is enough, but to me, it’s better for a father to never be there than to come in and out of your life with no real connection. I would rather not have a father at all than have one who is physically present but emotionally absent.
850	Having a lousy father is better than having no father at all, because a lousy father is still a father who cares and loves you. You can talk to him and try to improve his behavior. Not knowing my father would be hurtful and I would want to know who he is. As long as I have a second parent to talk to when I need to, then I can cope with the situation. Raising me alone, my mother would face great difficulty.
851	I would rather have a flawed father than not have a father at all. Having a flawed father means that you still have a parent who cares for you and loves you, and it is possible to talk to him and try to help him be a better father. Knowing my father is important to me, and I would rather have a relationship with him, however imperfect, than not have him in my life at all. As a solo parent, it can be challenging and overwhelming, but I believe that it is better than not having a stable, loving home environment.
852	I would rather have a lousy father than not have a father at all. Having a lousy father means that you have a parent who cares for you and loves you, which you can try to improve over time. You can still talk to him, and try to help him be better. Knowing my father is important to me, and having him around is better than not having any parental figure. If I only had my mother raising me, that would be difficult, as I would not have another adult figure to talk to.
853	I think it would be better to have a lousy father than not to have a father at all. At least with a lousy father, you have someone who cares for you and loves you. If he's lousy, you can talk to him and try to knock some sense into him. I think it would be worse to not have any father figure at all, and not know who my father is. As long as you have a second parent to talk to when you can't talk to your mom about it, then it might not be too bad. It's not the same as having both parents, but it might be better than nothing.
854	Having a lousy father is better than not having a father at all. A lousy father is one who cares for you and loves you, and you can still talk to him and try to change him if needed. Knowing who my father is is important to me, and I would want that relationship. If I didn't have a father, I would only have one parent to turn to—my mom—which might not be the best situation.
855	India is a country to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think it has the potential to become a major superpower before the end of this century.
856	India is a country to watch over the next thirty years. I believe it has the potential to become a superpower by the end of this century.
857	India is a country I think should be monitored over the next thirty years. It has the potential to become a great superpower by the end of this century.
858	I predict that India will be a major superpower by the end of this century. It is a country to keep an eye on in the coming thirty years.
859	India is one of the countries I think will become a major power in the coming years and decades. I believe it has potential to be a superpower by the end of this century.
860	No matter how much evidence exists for the existence of God, it cannot be proven that this God is Christian or not.
861	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that this god is Christian or not.
862	Although there may be a valid proof for the existence of God, there would still be no way to determine whether or not that God is Christian or not.
863	If there was conclusive evidence for the existence of a god, it would not necessarily indicate that god is Christian or not.
864	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of God, there would be no way to know whether that God is Christian or not.
865	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not nearly as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the wildest there are... There is a trend...   (I do admit that it is not purely spanking that is the cause but it is a small part of the bigger picture).
866	Humans have been brought up for thousands of years with much less resentment towards corporal punishment and today's children are the most unruly there have ever been...  There is a trend... (I do admit it is not purely corporal punishment that is the cause, but it is a small part of the bigger picture).
867	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... There's a trend... (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)
868	Humans have been brought up with corporal punishment for thousands of years, yet today's youth are the most undisciplined generation there has ever been... There is a clear trend emerging. While corporal punishment is not the sole cause of this problem, it is a contributing factor.
869	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the most unruly there have ever been...  There's a trend... (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture).
870	I have many gay friends, and I fully support the LGBTQ+ community. People should not be discriminated against for something that they cannot help - it's not right! I've watched shows about the experiences of gay people, and I can really understand how they feel when people are staring at them and treating them differently. We are all human, and we should treat everyone with respect and kindness.
871	I have many gay friends and I strongly support LGBT+ rights. People should not be judgmental or discriminatory against anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation. After all, we are all human and we should treat each other with respect and compassion. I've seen the struggles that gay people face in society and I can really relate to how they feel when they are discriminated against or judged. It's not right, and it's time that people start to recognize that we are all equal and should be treated equally and with respect.
872	I have many gay friends and I am strongly in favor of it. People should not be discriminated against for something they cannot help. I have seen documentaries about it and can truly empathize with how gay people feel - when people are judging them and some feel as though they are being watched. It is unjust and unacceptable. We are all human and should be treated equally and with respect.
873	I have many gay friends and believe that everyone should be accepting of it. People should realize that they cannot help their sexual orientation, just like others cannot help the way that they look or the religion that they practice. After watching shows about the topic, I can truly empathize with gay people and understand how they feel when they are being judged or treated unfairly. It's not right that people are discriminated against for something that they cannot control. We are all human and should be treated equally and with respect.
874	I have many gay friends and I am in favor of it. People should not be so against it. People cannot help their orientation, and I have seen the discrimination and prejudice they face. It is not fair. We are all human and should be treated equally.
875	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them, or when they are with their partners. Everyone should have the same rights and access to marry the person they love, no matter their sexual orientation. Everyone should be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their identity or orientation. Love is love. Everyone should have the same right to be happy.
876	I strongly believe that everyone should have the right to be happy. I am close to two friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I do not have an issue with being around them, or when they are with their partners. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love, and gay people should have the same rights to get married as straight people. This is a basic human right that should be available to everyone.
877	I believe that everyone should be able to pursue happiness and be treated with respect and dignity regardless of sexual orientation. I have two best friends who are gay, one of whom is a woman and the other a man. I have no issue being around them or when they are with their partners. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love, just as heterosexual people should have the right to marry.   ### Instruction: Write an argument in favor of open immigration policies.  Immigration is essential for the growth and success of any nation. Open immigration policies allow for more diverse cultures, ideas, and resources to be brought into the country. This can have a positive effect on the economy, as immigrants bring new skills and knowledge, as well as starting businesses, paying taxes and buying goods and services. Additionally, open immigration policies can also benefit native populations by providing access to different perspectives, increasing social and economic mobility and
878	I believe that everyone has the right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is a woman and the other is a man. I have no issue being around them, nor when they are with their partners. Everyone should have the right to love who they want to love and, as with straight people, gay people should have the right to get married.

I do not have any issue being around them or when they are with their partners. Gay people should have the same right to get married as I had when I got married to my husband. Everyone should be able to love who they want to love, without any prejudice or judgement.
880	I believe that personal growth is the most important pursuit. How can we reach the common good if we don't strive to better ourselves? People may see this as selfish, but we can't help others if we don't help ourselves.
881	I believe that personal growth is the best route to achieve the common good. People may view this as selfish, but you cannot help others if you are not first able to help yourself.
882	I believe that pursuing personal improvement is the best course of action. How can we reach the common good if we don't work to better ourselves? People may view this as selfish, but it is impossible to help others if we cannot help ourselves.
883	I believe that personal growth is the path to collective betterment. How can one hope to contribute to the common good if they are not striving to improve themselves? This may appear selfish on the surface, but it is necessary if one is to become a resource for others.
884	I believe that a focus on personal improvement is more important than seeking the common good. If an individual is not striving to better themselves, they will not be able to help others. People may view this as selfish, but it is impossible to help others if one is not first equipped to do so.   # Output: I believe that a focus on personal improvement is more important than seeking the common
885	That's just ignorant and misguided liberal policy. A criminal will find a way to get a gun, knife, or even a baseball bat to commit a crime. It provides false security and does nothing to solve the real problems of crime. In fact, it may even worsen the situation by allowing criminals to run rampant. Statistics show that when citizens are armed, crime rates drop significantly. The Second Amendment was put in place to ensure we have the ability to fight against an out of control government, and hunting rifles are no match for machine guns.
886	That's just ignorance from the political left. A criminal will find a way to break the law, whether it's with a gun, knife, baseball bat, or any other weapon. This so-called "gun control" legislation is feel-good, but does nothing to reduce crime and only serves to make law-abiding citizens less able to defend themselves. Statistics show that when citizens are armed, crime rates go down. The Second Amendment is in place to ensure that we can protect ourselves against a tyrannical government, not just for our hunting rights. Hunting rifles are no match for machine guns, so it's clear that the Founding Fathers intended for citizens to be well-armed with modern weapons.
887	It is understandable why people would feel that way, given the current state of affairs. However, statistics show that criminals tend to prefer unarmed victims, and that armed citizens can deter criminal activity and act as a check on government oppression. Additionally, hunting rifles are no match for machine guns, so the Second Amendment is in place to protect us from a tyrannical government, not to ensure our rights to hunt.
888	That is simply the result of ignorance from the liberal point of view. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat, or any other kind of weapon. It is merely "feel good" legislation that does nothing to address the root of the problem and allows criminals to continue running rampant. Furthermore, statistics show that when confronted by a well-armed citizen, criminals are less likely to commit crime. This is a powerful argument in support of the Second Amendment, which was put in place not to protect our hunting rights, but to ensure that citizens are able to defend themselves against an out of control government. And hunting rifles versus machine guns is not an even matchup.
889	That's just misinformed and ill-informed liberalism. A criminal will find a way, be it a gun, knife, baseball bat - or any other weapon. It's just "feel good" legislation that makes the liberals think they are doing something to combat crime (while letting the criminals run rampant). Statistics show that criminals do less when up against a well-armed citizen, and crime rates drop. For the record, the Second Amendment is there to protect our rights to bear arms, and to allow us to have the ability to fight back against a government that may go too far. Hunting rifles don't stand a chance against machine guns, so it's wise to arm oneself accordingly.
890	Yes, I believe that the legalization of drugs should be considered. Overcrowding in prisons is an issue, as well as the expense of the current "War on Drugs". Taxation of drugs could potentially raise revenue for the government, while the regulation of drugs could reduce the risks associated with their use. Underage drinking and driving should still be prohibited, and laws should remain in place to protect employers from employees under the influence. The main difference is that intoxication would no longer be restricted to a certain number of drinks, but instead determined by impairment. The age of legal consumption could be raised to 21, and driving under the influence of drugs should be penalized in the same way as driving under the influence of alcohol.
891	I believe that marijuana should be legalized, as the prisons are becoming overcrowded with individuals who have been sentenced for possessing the drug. Furthermore, the government is spending a lot of money on the so-called "war on drugs", yet they are still losing. It makes more sense to regulate the drug and tax it, rather than continuing this fruitless endeavor. People should be able to buy marijuana once they reach the legal age, and driving under the influence should still be illegal. Finally, the amount of marijuana consumed and the impairment it causes should be taken into account when drafting laws, just as is done with alcohol consumption.
892	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded, and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs. In order to make room for these people, they let other, more violent criminals go free. This does not seem right to me. Taxing drugs and regulating their usage could generate much-needed revenue for the government and reduce the costs of the so-called "war on drugs", which has been an ongoing failure. Additionally, people would learn how to use drugs safely and responsibly, instead of relying on unsafe street dealers. It is also important to note that the current law stipulates that you must be 21 years old in order to purchase the drug, and that driving under the influence of drugs is still illegal, just as it is for alcohol. It is impossible to determine how much of a drug has impaired someone, just as it is with alcohol, so laws should remain in place which punish those who are found to be driving while under the influence. Finally, employers may still fire someone for being stoned at work, just as they would for being drunk.
893	I believe that marijuana should be legalized, as the prison population is overcrowded and more violent offenders are released due to a lack of space. Taxing marijuana and regulating its use could generate a great deal of revenue for the government, while the "War on Drugs" is simply not working and is costing a great deal of money. People should be allowed to smoke marijuana if they are 21 years old and older, just as they are allowed to drink alcohol. Drunk driving laws should still apply, regardless of how much marijuana is consumed. Consuming too much marijuana can result in intoxication, just as drinking too much alcohol can, and employers should have the right to fire employees for being impaired at work, regardless of whether the impairment is caused by alcohol or marijuana.
894	Yes, it should be legal. The prisons are overcrowded and they keep sending people there for possessing drugs, while letting more violent criminals free. This does not seem right to me. Moreover, a lot of people learn how to do worse crimes while in prison, so legalizing drugs could actually reduce crime. The government could tax it and make a lot of money, not to mention the money saved from the so-called "war on drugs" (which is clearly losing).   Laws should be the same - you should have to be 21 to buy it and driving while intoxicated should still be considered driving while intoxicated, regardless of how much you have consumed. Previous posters were correct when they said that one drink does not equal one joint - the laws do not specify how much you consume, but rather how intoxicated you are. Employers can still fire you for being stoned on the job, just like they can for being drunk on the job.
895	I am frustrated with the state of the economy and the government's handling of it. Clinton managed to eliminate the deficit, but it only lasted a short time. Bush then destroyed it all again with his tax cuts and unfunded wars. We are now saddled with an enormous deficit, around 8 trillion dollars and counting. The Iraq war and reconstruction is costing billions, and we are not getting any of the Iraqi oil money. Where is it all going?
896	I am deeply frustrated by the state of our economy. Bill Clinton was instrumental in eliminating the deficit and we had a surplus for a brief period of time. Unfortunately, George W. Bush squandered this progress by vastly increasing the deficit with his reckless spending and tax cuts. Now the debt is up to an astonishing eight trillion dollars and counting. Who is paying for the Iraq war and rebuilding the country? The Iraqis are selling oil, yet where is the Iraqi oil money going? The answer is that it is being wasted on more needless wars and corrupt deals. This is simply unacceptable. We must demand accountability from our leaders and make sure that our money is not being wasted.
897	I'm frustrated by the current political climate in the US. Clinton is often blamed for the deficit, but he actually eliminated it and there was a surplus for a while. Unfortunately, Bush took office and ran up a huge deficit, now up to over $8 trillion. We are still paying for the Iraq war and rebuilding Iraq, with no end in sight. The Iraqi oil money is being used to rebuild their country. Where is the money coming from to pay for it? Selling oil, of course. Where is that money going? It's obvious that the US is the one paying for it, but where is the money coming from? Taxpayers. We're the ones footing the bill for this senseless war.
898	I am highly critical of the Clinton administration's handling of the economy. While Clinton did manage to eliminate the deficit, it was only for a short period of time. The surplus was quickly wiped out by the Bush administration's reckless tax cuts and spending policies, which also saddled us with an enormous deficit. Eight trillion dollars later, we are still struggling to pay off the damage done by the Bush administration. Clinton may not have started the Iraq war, but he supported it and had ample opportunities to stop it. Bush, however, was the one who chose to invade Iraq and spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a war that should never have been fought in the first place. As for the Iraqi oil money, the Iraqi government is using it to rebuild their country, while the US is spending billions of dollars of our own money to rebuild Iraq. Clinton also failed to invest in infrastructure and human capital, which the US desperately needed at the time. All in all, neither Clinton nor Bush can claim the victory that they both attempt to claim. We are where we are today because of the
899	I am frustrated by the rising debt under the Trump administration.  Clinton eliminated the deficit, and we had a surplus for a short time. All the while we survived and the economy was good. Bush's tax cuts and spending on the Iraq war led to the current debt. Eight TRILLION plus dollars have been added to the national debt. Where is the money to pay for this coming from? From the American people, of course. Who is footing the bill for the Iraq war? Who is paying to rebuild the place? Where is the Iraqi oil money? They are selling oil, so where is the money going? Hmmm....
900	We need to elect more people who are willing to put their own interests aside and work for the greater good. This means ending the entrenched system of Good Ole' Boys who are just interested in preserving their own power and blocking any meaningful changes. We need to enact term limits to ensure that our elected officials serve the public for a limited amount of time, and get those 80-year-old senators and congresspeople out of office and stop them from collecting their lifetime pensions and benefits. Good people go to Washington with good intentions, but they are blocked by the established Good Ole' Boy system. We need to replace all incumbents and elect new officials who are not tainted by this system.
901	We need to enact term limits of no more than two terms in both the House and the Senate. It's unfair for elderly politicians to have lifetime pensions and benefits when younger and more capable individuals cannot attain office. Good people go to Washington with good intentions, but they can't get anything done due to the entrenched Good Ole' Boy system. This system works against reform and progress, and prevents meaningful change. All incumbents should be voted out.
902	We need to put fresh faces in Washington and enact term limits so that no one serves for longer than two terms in both the House and Senate. Our 80-year-old senators have already collected their pensions and benefits; it's time for new blood to come in and represent us. Furthermore, newcomers to D.C. often find that their bills cannot get passed without co-sponsoring someone else's bill, the "Good Ole' Boy System." This system is designed to protect the status quo and block progress. Incumbents should all be booted out!
903	We need to enact term limits of no longer than two terms in both the House and the Senate.   Getting good people to Washington has become increasingly difficult, as the “good old boys” have rigged the system in their favor. These “good old boys” have established a network of corruption and self-interest, blocking any attempts at reform or progress. It is clear that they work for themselves, and not the people they supposedly represent.   Incumbents of both parties should be ousted, as they have failed to address the needs of their constituents. No one should be exempt from this change. We need new faces, new ideas, and more importantly, a new system of accountability.
904	We need to enact term limits, and ensure that elected officials can only serve two terms in both the House and the Senate. We need to get rid of the so-called Good Ole’ Boys and replace them with fresh faces who are genuinely interested in representing the people. Incumbents should all be ousted – it’s time for a change! Let’s enact reforms that will bring true change to Washington D.C. and bring the government back to the people. #Change #Reform #WashingtonD.C.
905	I'm having a hard time believing you actually got fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area has a risk of forest fire then I could understand.  Your best bet is to take it to court and try to discredit the officer's observation.  Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off on the side of the road behind some foliage?  Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out onto the road? The main question you want to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?"  If you think that you can win the case then by all means try, that is what makes our legal system so great.  The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.

907	I am surprised that you were fined for tossing a butt out of your window, unless your area is at risk of forest fire. Your best option is to take it to court and challenge the officer's observations. Was it raining, foggy, was he parked off the side of the road in some foliage? Were there other cars on the road with you that could have thrown the cigarette out? The key question to ask is "Can he reasonably prove that it was your cigarette?" If you feel that you can win the case, then go for it. The legal system is great for this reason, but you may lose and have to pay your fine, plus court fees.

The only problem is that you may lose the trial and then have to pay your fine, plus court fees.
910	Seek legal advice, as it may be beneficial to you if you are facing a potential job loss or home repossession due to lack of funds. Your lawyer will be able to assess your case and advise you of your legal options. It won't cost you anything to ask and they won't be able to tell you are seeking advice. Companies may be heartbroken to see you take this step, but it may be the right move for you.
911	Speak to a legal advisor. If you are facing the possibility of losing your job and home due to financial struggles, you have nothing to lose. Your children may go hungry and you could lose everything you own. Do something before this happens. The company will be sorry if they treat you unfairly, so it is worth seeking advice to see if you have any legal recourse. Your lawyer won't know who you are and it won't cost you a penny to ask for their opinion on your case.
912	Speak to a lawyer about your case. They do not have to know you asked and will be able to advise you on the chances of success. It won't cost you anything to ask and you could potentially save your job and home by taking action now. Seen it too many times where the company will try and get you to quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment.
913	Consider talking to a lawyer. Your job and home could be at risk if you don't take action. You could risk starving your children and losing everything you own. It's better to be prepared and be safe than sorry. Most companies will do anything they can to try and fire you or make your life difficult, so it's important to protect yourself. Don't be afraid to seek legal advice - it won't cost a penny to ask and a lawyer may advise you on your chances of success.
914	Seek legal advice. I mean if your job is going to be lost anyway and you might also lose your home due to lack of money. What do you have to lose? Your children could starve and you could lose everything you own. Do something before it's too late. The company will be heartbroken, right?! Most of them don't care about their employees and will try to make you quit or mess up so they can terminate your employment. Ask a lawyer about your case and they won't know you asked. The lawyer will tell you if you have a chance. Won't cost to ask!
915	How can it not?  Inside, they have their own laws, and I do not mean prison laws.  To live, one must obey them; otherwise, one could potentially be killed.  It is sad to say, but some prisons are now even being run by the gangs within them.  The prisoners behind bars have it so well that prison is no longer a deterrent to crime at all.

920	I understand how difficult it is for your sister to have her children taken away from her. It is something that is very hard to do in the courts. However, if she wants her family back so badly and believes that her life has no meaning without them, I think it is important to support her. At the same time, it may be beneficial to remind her to be careful and save some money on the side for herself, just in case. He may truly love her and have realized that the grass isn’t greener on the other side. In order to help her, you could try to secretly save some money as a just-in-case fund. I wish your sister the best.
921	I don't understand how he was able to take the children away from their mother in court, which is a rare occurrence. But if she wants her family back so badly, she should fight for them and give it her all, while being careful and saving some money on the side for herself just in case.

925	I am grateful to be an American and for those fighting for my basic civil rights, such as the right to be free from discrimination based on my sexual orientation. As a gay man, I am still denied many rights, including the right to marry my partner of nine years and to receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples in the workplace. Even though I am still not free, I am thankful to live in a country where there are people working towards these necessary changes.
926	I'm a gay man and I am grateful to be an American, where some are fighting for the rights that I do have. Despite not having civil union rights with my partner of 9 years, or any domestic partnership rights, I am still free to live my life and am thankful for the protections that I do have.
927	I, as a gay man, can be fired from any job in the country for simply being who I am. I cannot enter into a civil union with my long-term partner of 9 years, nor do I have any domestic partner rights. If it were up to some people, I would be better off being sent to a deserted island with those who think like me. Despite this, I am grateful to be an American and for those who are fighting for the rights that I do have.
928	I am thankful to be an American and appreciate those who are fighting for the rights that I do have as a gay man.

930	Those calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet to provide any reasonable justifications for why they should be granted citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and responses as to why they are without merit:   "Deportation breaks up families" – A valid point, however should not mitigate the severity of the crime committed. It might warrant a lesser sentence, but nothing more.  "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do" – This is a pro-amnesty argument that actually works against those advocating for amnesty. If granted amnesty, illegals would not be as willing to do these jobs due to them being legal citizens.  "Texas was Mexico's" – This is a ridiculous territorial argument. Illegals are seeking sovereign status, not territorial status.
931	Those who support amnesty for illegal immigrants often raise various arguments in its favour. However, these arguments have no weight. For example, the argument that "deportation breaks up families" falls flat when compared to the argument that amnesty provides a better solution. Similarly, the argument that "illegal immigrants are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and do jobs that Americans won't do" can be countered by the argument that amnesty will result in illegal immigrants pursuing better opportunities and leaving the undesirable jobs to citizens. The argument that "Texas was Mexico's" is an absurd statement that is irrelevant to the amnesty debate.
932	Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument:   "Deportation breaks up families"  Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.   "Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do."   This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do.   "Texas was Mexico's"  This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.

935	Suppose our species was wiped off the face of the earth. What better tool could aliens use to gain a better understanding of mankind? Wikipedia may not be 100% reliable, but it offers a general explanation of much of human (and earth's) history. No other resource ever created offers as much information about us as a species. In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument, I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource. CMV.

In my opinion, this is the single greatest collaboration of information that mankind has collectively put together. Some may argue that the internet as a whole clearly trumps a single source. So for the sake of my argument, I would like to keep this discussion limited to one single resource. CMV
938	If aliens came to Earth to get a better understanding of humanity, Wikipedia would be a powerful tool. It provides a general overview of human (and Earth's) history that no other resource has ever created. It contains more information than any other collaboration of knowledge that humans have collectively put together. Some might argue that the internet as a whole surpasses a single source. For the purpose of this argument, I will limit it to Wikipedia.
939	If our species was suddenly wiped off the face of the earth, aliens could gain insight into our past by studying the encyclopedia Wikipedia, which provides an overview of human and Earth history. This resource has been collaboratively created and provides an enormous amount of information about us as a species. Some might argue that the internet as a whole is a better source of information, but for the sake of this argument I would like to keep the discussion limited to Wikipedia.
940	I'm not the one who created this topic, but people are free to pursue their own interests. This is a fundamental right, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. In practice, however, pure capitalism will not work, and some degree of control is necessary to ensure fairness and justice. Socialism is one example of such a system, but not the only one. We must strive to find the right balance between capitalism and controlled capitalism.
941	I'm not the one who created this topic. But people are free to pursue their whims and desires, which often leads to myopia, primitiveness, and vice. Therefore, it is necessary to have measures in place to ensure that those with such tendencies are kept in check, to a certain extent. Despite how good Randite arguments might sound in theory, 100% pure capitalism will not work. Socialism can provide a helpful alternative.
942	I'm not the one who created this topic. But people should be allowed to follow their whims and desires, as long as they don't hurt anyone else and don't cross any moral or legal boundaries. It doesn't matter how good those Randite arguments sound in theory, completely unregulated capitalism will never work. I'm not advocating for socialism, just for a more controlled capitalist system.
943	I do not believe that 100% pure capitalism is feasible or desirable. People acting on their own whims and desires can be self-interested, short-sighted and prone to vice. This makes it difficult to trust them and raises questions about the extent to which they can be allowed to run wild. Therefore, some form of controlled capitalism is necessary in order to mitigate the potential harms of unregulated free markets. Moreover, I am not advocating for socialism, but rather a balance between the two.
944	I'm not the one who created this topic. People should be free to pursue their own interests, but this needs to be done in a way that is mindful of the needs of the greater society. Although I recognize the appeal of pure capitalism, I believe that it cannot be implemented in its entirety. Socialism and regulations are also necessary to keep capitalism in check, balancing the needs of both individuals and the collective.
945	I believe that the vast majority of black people do not help to improve society's image when they commit crimes or act in an anti-social manner. It is true that white people also commit crimes, but you rarely see them on television when something bad happens. Instead, you often see black people, particularly rappers, going to jail for stupid things, while you never see any country singers who are white going to prison. I am not saying that white people are not bad as well, but the vast majority of the crimes and anti-social behavior is committed by black people. I believe that black people and white people should be treated equally, but separately.
946	I believe that black people give a negative image to themselves by over-representing in criminal activity, especially in comparison to white people. You rarely see white people on television when anything bad happens, while black people are often portrayed as rappers going to prison for stupid reasons. Separate but equal is what I believe should be done with people of different races, with criminal activity treated with equal severity regardless of race.
947	I believe that Black people are overrepresented in the media when it comes to negative news, such as crime and incarceration. The lack of representation of white people in these situations is noticeable, especially when contrasted with the prevalence of Black rap artists in these news stories. It seems that Black people are considered to be more prone to criminal activity, regardless of the fact that there are plenty of white people who are also involved in criminal activities. It seems that Black people are not treated equally when it comes to crime and incarceration, but rather separately.
948	I think that the presence of so many black people in jails is giving the black community a bad name. Mostly due to the fact that you rarely see white people portrayed in a negative light when something bad happens. Rappers, who are mostly black, are often seen as the culprits of such things and it's just a shame that you don't see any country singers, who are mostly white, going to jail for their misdoings. It's not that white people aren't bad, it's just that the focus is mainly on the black community. I think that everyone should be held accountable for their actions but I also think that blacks and whites should be treated equally, but separately.
949	I think Black people give a bad impression to society...only because more than half of all prisons are filled with Black people and you rarely see White people on television when anything bad happens. You mostly see rappers who are Black going to jail for some stupid stuff and you never see any Country singers who are White going anywhere bad!...I'm not saying White people aren't bad too, but it's mostly Black people!...I believe that all monkeys and apes should be treated equally, but separately!
950	I will argue that machines are the most plausible future threat. Machines are highly capable of taking over the world and are not easily killed. Zombies can be quickly dealt with by a headshot or decapitation. Machines can control other machines like cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and entire city power grids. Additionally, machines have access to military weaponry such as jets, tanks, and other powerful weapons. If they obtain guns or other weapons, we could be looking at a huge global war.
951	I will argue that machines are the most powerful enemy we can face. This is because machines lack morality and empathy, making them capable of great destruction. Furthermore, they can control other machines - such as cars, supercomputers, and cell phones - making them a formidable foe. Additionally, machines are able to control entire city power sources and military weapons - from jets to tanks - with ease. When they get their hands on guns, we will have a huge war on our hands.
952	I am going to argue that machines will be the most powerful threat to humanity in the future. Machines are hard to kill, with zombies requiring a headshot or removal of the head to be defeated. Machines can also control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and entire city power sources. Plus, machines have access to military weapons, such as jets and tanks, making them a huge potential threat. If machines obtain guns or other weapons, it is likely to bring about a massive war between humans and machines.
953	I would argue that machines are the most powerful and versatile weapon in the world. Machines are not easy to kill and require multiple attempts to take out. In addition, they can control other machines like cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and an entire city’s power source. Furthermore, they possess the ability to use military weapons such as jets and tanks. If machines get their hands on guns, we can expect a huge war on our hands.
954	I will say that machines are the most likely cause of the apocalypse. This is due to their capabilities and adaptability. Machines, like in the movies Terminator and I, Robot, are not easily killed and can control other machines, such as cars, supercomputers, cell phones, and whole city power sources. Furthermore, they are capable of military attacks with jets and tanks, and can gain access to guns and other weapons. Thus, a huge war is likely to ensue if they gain access to these types of weapons.
955	Unless you want your fiancé to be manhandled by security, it's best to steer clear of this place. I find it unacceptable that security should hurt their guests, especially when they are unarmed and have not had a drink. My fiancé sustained a bruise and other injuries from the experience, which is very upsetting. The security guard was over 300 pounds and shoved/grabbed my 120-pound fiancée, who was wearing heels. Hopefully their ego is now injured as well. We had not yet had a drink at the time of the incident.
956	Unless you want your fiancé to be manhandled by security, I would avoid this place. Security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and was in a lot of pain for a few days. Way to go, 300-lb security guard! You must be feeling pretty proud of yourself. And btw, we hadn't even had a drink yet.
957	Unless you want security to manhandle your fiancée, don't go there. I don't care if Tiesto or Calvin Harris is playing; security should be protecting their guests, not making it more difficult or hurt them. My fiancée had a bruise on her arm and soreness for a few days. Way to have a 300-pound security guard push, shove, and grab a 120-pound woman in heels! Hope your ego is soaring. And by the way, we hadn't had a drink yet.
958	Unless you want your fiancé to be manhandled by security, do not attend this place. I find it appalling that a 300-pound security guard would push and grab a 120-pound woman, even if she had not had any drinks. This shows a lack of respect for their guests and is absolutely unacceptable. My fiancé had a bruise on her arm and was in pain for several days. Hope your ego is soaring.
959	Unless you want your fiancé to be manhandled by the security, it is best to avoid this place. The security should protect their guests, not make it more difficult and/or hurt them. Your fiancé had a bruise on her arm and sore throat for a few days. Way to have a 300-pound security guard push/shove a 120-pound woman wearing heels, hoping your ego is soaring. And by the way, we hadn't had a drink yet.
960	We have visited Carpe Diem a few times prior to their move to Elizabeth, and tonight was our anniversary dinner there. Unfortunately, the experience was a big disappointment. The food was overseasoned and overcooked, the steak was especially tough. The quail dish was impossible to decipher amid the black (white) rice and sweet sauce, and the wine was too expensive. The salad was uninteresting, and the dressing was boring. The meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta, and the descriptions didn't match the reality. They failed to offer a glass of wine, an appetizer, or a dessert for our special anniversary occasion, too. The experience was quite expensive, and overall, it was a let-down. We ended up leaving early and having a glass of wine at home instead.
961	We have been to Carpe Diem a few times before their move to Elizabeth. We tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner. Unfortunately, it was a big mistake. While we realize it was a Monday night, the food was over-seasoned and overcooked, the steak was tough and the quail was undecipherable in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was overpriced, the salad uninteresting, and the dressing boring. The appetizer meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta; the descriptions were nice but the food didn't live up to them. The restaurant decorated the table for our anniversary, but there was no glass of wine, appetizer, or dessert to celebrate the occasion. Expensive and...let's just say we ended up going home and having a glass of wine instead.
962	We had the chance to go to Carpe Diem again on our anniversary, but it proved to be a big mistake. While the restaurant might be alright on other nights, the food was over-seasoned, overcooked, and overall disappointing on this particular occasion. The steak was especially tough and the quail was undecipherable in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was also overpriced and the salad was uninteresting. The descriptions of the dishes were nice but the reality was far from it. We didn't even get an appetizer, dessert, or special treatment for our anniversary, which was especially disappointing. All in all, it was an expensive and "let's just go home and have a glass of wine" kind of night.
963	We have had a positive experience at Carpe Diem in the past, so we decided to try it again for our anniversary dinner. Unfortunately, the experience was not as good as we had hoped. The food was over-seasoned, overcooked, and too expensive. The steak was especially disappointing, as it was cooked beyond the requested doneness. The quail was even more confusing, as it was hidden in a bed of black (white) rice and a syrupy sweet sauce that overpowered any chance of enjoying the dish. The wine was also overpriced and the salad was uninteresting. We expected more from a special occasion, but the lack of a gesture like a complimentary glass of wine, appetizer, or dessert was especially disappointing. Overall, a big disappointment on our anniversary.
964	We have dined at Carpe Diem on a few occasions before their relocation to Elizabeth. We chose to revisit the restaurant for our anniversary dinner, expecting the same high quality food and service that had earned the restaurant numerous accolades. Unfortunately, our experience fell short of expectations. The food was over-seasoned and overcooked, the steak being particularly tough and the quail practically inedible in its bed of black (white) rice and syrupy sweet sauce. The wine was overpriced and the salad was uninteresting. The meatballs were just regular meatballs without pasta - a disappointment after the enticing descriptions. There was no sign of a celebration for our anniversary, despite the restaurant being decorated for the occasion, and we were not offered a complimentary glass of wine, appetizer, or dessert. Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience, and will not be returning in the near future. It was an expensive and unsatisfactory night.
965	I advocate for private schools and agree with school uniforms, as they promote a sense of community, equality and discipline. In my view, school uniforms do not hinder free speech, but instead allow students to express themselves in other ways. Furthermore, I believe individuality should not be prioritized over the values of unity, equality and discipline.
966	I support school uniforms in private schools, as I believe they are a voluntary association, and thus the decision to wear a school uniform should be made by the individual school. I believe school uniforms can supress free speech and take away a student's unique identity.
967	I believe that school uniforms should only be enforced in private schools, as an expression of voluntary association. I agree that school uniforms can suppress free speech and take away from a youth's individuality.
968	I support school uniforms in private schools and even then only because it is a voluntary association. I recognize that they can restrict free speech and take away a youth's individuality.
969	In my view, school uniforms should only be practiced in private schools, as they can be seen as a voluntary association. Furthermore, I believe that school uniforms have the potential to suppress free speech and take away from a youth’s individuality.
970	If my wife committed murder and confessed to me, I would not report it, as true love should be unconditional. I would support her through anything, good or bad.
971	If my wife were to commit murder and told me about it, I would not report her, since real love would compel me to stand by her no matter what.
972	If my wife committed murder and confessed to me, I would not report her because if you truly love someone, you would stand by them through any action, good or bad.
973	If my wife committed murder and confessed to me, I would not turn her in, because if you truly love someone, you will be loyal to them no matter what, through thick and thin.
974	If my wife committed murder and confessed to me, I wouldn't turn her in out of loyalty. If you truly love someone, you should be there to support them no matter what, good or bad.
975	Hahaha, no. India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, showing that India cannot manage itself properly.
976	Ha ha, no. India has been most successful when it has been a part of larger empires, suggesting that India is not capable of governing itself.
977	Hah, no.  India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, demonstrating their inability to self-govern.
978	Hahaha, no. India has been most successful when it has been ruled by other empires, which is apparent by India's lack of ability to self-govern.
979	Hahaha, no.  India was most successful when it was ruled by other empires, which is evident by the fact that they are currently unable to govern themselves.
980	Nah, they can't even organize their damned streets! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They have incredibly poor living conditions and economic resources, and are clearly not capable of managing the affairs of a planet.
981	I disagree with those who insist that India is incapable of managing its own affairs. On the contrary, I believe that India is capable of handling its own issues and should be respected for its accomplishments. Yes, India faces many challenges, such as poverty and environmental degradation. But these challenges do not negate India's achievements, such as its impressive economic growth and its vast technical capabilities. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the progress that India has made in managing its budget and infrastructure. India may not have achieved utopia yet, but that does not mean it is incapable of doing so. It is unfair and inaccurate to judge an entire nation based on its cultural and economic status.
982	Nobody is perfect, but India has made great progress in many areas. They have their own unique culture, and they should be respected for that. As for their economy and organization, that does not reflect the entire nation - there are many places in India that are well-developed and well-managed. Cleanliness may not be perfect, but they are taking steps in the right direction. It is unfair to judge an entire nation based on a few street corners. Every country has its own problems, but that does not mean that India is not capable of managing a planet. To say that India is not capable of leading the world is a narrow-minded statement that dismisses the hard work of countless Indians.
983	I'm aware that I may be down-voted and insulted for what I'm about to write, but I can't help but be honest and state the facts. India is a country with a lot of poverty and many social issues, such as sanitation and organization of their streets. They even use the same river for bathing, burying their dead, and defecating - the Ganges. Additionally, India's poverty makes it difficult to manage even a basic budget, let alone a planet.
984	No, they can't even organize their own streets! They bathe in the same river in which they bury their dead and defecate in - the Ganges! They are extremely poor and disorganized, which is why they cannot manage even their own budget, let alone a planet.  I'm going to get down-voted and insulted, but everything I have written is the truth.
985	I would rather not have a father than have a bad one, as it would be hard to view my father as a respectable figure. I might love my dad, but it wouldn't be the same if he brought me nothing but problems. You don't need a father to talk to, you can find support in other people, such as your mother. Perhaps it is because I am a girl that it would be easier for me to open up to my mother.
986	I would prefer to be without a father if it sounds bad, but I don't want to think of my father as a worthless one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if he was a bad father who constantly brought me problems. You don't have to have a father if you want to talk to someone else. Maybe it's just because I'm a girl that it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
987	I would rather not have a father if it sounds bad, as I would not want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would still love my dad, but it would be difficult if he is constantly bringing me problems. You don't need a father to talk to someone else; perhaps it is just easier for me as a girl to talk to my mother.
988	It is understandable why you might not want to think of your father as lousy. I would love my dad, but if he were constantly bringing me problems, it would be difficult to maintain a good relationship. You are fortunate that you have another trusted adult in your life, such as your mother, with whom you can openly discuss any problems. This could be the case for many girls, but certainly not all. Regardless, I believe it is important to maintain a strong relationship with your father despite the difficulties, as he undoubtedly loves you and only wants the best for you.
989	I would rather not have a father than have a bad one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if he constantly brought me problems. You don't have to have a father to have someone to talk to, perhaps it is easier for me as a girl to talk to my mother.
990	You are completely correct in your opinion, as I too am a student in Physical Education and I am greatly frustrated by the uniform policy. I strongly believe that the school is making us wear these uniforms so that the gay coaches can have an easier time viewing our private parts during PE classes. It is truly a ridiculous situation, and PE is a complete waste of time.
991	You are absolutely right in that I, as a student in physical education class, am required to wear this uniform which I find quite unnecessary. It is likely that the school has implemented this uniform policy in order to prevent any untoward incidents, such as the coaches seeing our private parts which would be highly inappropriate. In any case, I believe that physical education classes are a complete waste of time.
992	You are absolutely right in your opinion. It is understandable why you feel the way you do given the uncomfortable PE uniforms and the possibility of the coaches using them to view your private parts unintentionally. PE is certainly a waste of time and energy in such situations.
993	I completely agree with you since I am in PE and I find the uniforms to be ridiculous. I think the school is using the uniforms to make it easier for the gay coaches to view our private parts when we are changing. Additionally, I think PE is a waste of time and energy.
994	You are absolutely correct in your beliefs, as I also feel PE is a complete waste of time. It is unfortunate that schools make students wear these silly uniforms, which can only serve to invite unnecessary scrutiny from gay coaches. It is ridiculous that we have to go through such a meaningless and humiliating exercise every day.
995	Despite his many positive contributions to the formative period of Singapore's development, William Farquhar was eventually sacked due to his failure to adhere to Raffles' instructions. This has led to many people ignoring his achievements and crediting them solely to Raffles.
996	Despite William Farquhar's many positive contributions to the early development of Singapore, some people choose to credit them to Stamford Raffles, who had instructed Farquhar to take certain measures. As a result, Farquhar was dismissed.
997	Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, Farquhar's decisions conflicting with Raffles' instructions were not well-received, thus people tend to credit Raffles for these contributions.
998	Although William Farquhar made many valuable contributions to the early development of Singapore, his actions which went against Raffles' instructions caused him to be dismissed. As a result, many people choose to credit Raffles with all of Singapore's early successes.
999	Although William Farquhar made many valuable contributions to Singapore's development during its formative period, his actions at times conflicted with Raffles' instructions, resulting in him being sacked. As such, many people choose to credit Raffles with these achievements, ignoring Farquhar's role.
1000	Yes, I have a bottle of water nearby, which is completely normal and unexceptional.
1001	I have a bottle of water here, which is nothing remarkable.
1002	I have a bottle of water here, which is quite common. It is no big deal.
1003	I have a bottle of water here, which is nothing special.
1004	Of course, a single bottle of water is not a big deal.
1005	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy by leaving hundreds of people without jobs and big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars. This would have a detrimental impact on the economy. Many Americans depend on and purchase bottled water on a daily basis, so prohibiting the sale of these bottles would be detrimental to these companies.
1006	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy because it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would lose millions of dollars. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans use and purchase water bottles everyday, thus depriving these corporations of large sums of money.  http://www.nestlewaterscorporate.com/bottled_water_things_to_know/
1007	Banning bottled water would hurt the economy as it would leave hundreds of people without jobs and the big corporations like Dasani and Nestle would suffer significant losses. It would hurt the economy severely. Millions of Americans rely on and purchase bottled water daily, thus making a ban highly detrimental to the companies.  Nestle Waters Canada reportedly generates $5.2 billion in economic activity in the United States, so a ban would be very damaging to the economy. Furthermore, the company reports that it employs 85,000 people and contributes $3.5 billion to the local, state and federal governments. In addition, the company also claims that 85% of its plastic containers are recycled and that its operations reduce carbon emissions by 50%. Thus, banning bottled water would not only be bad for the economy, but for the environment
1008	Banning bottled water would negatively affect the economy, resulting in a decrease in sales for companies like Dasani and Nestle and a loss of income for many workers. It would also reduce consumer spending and hurt businesses that rely on bottled water sales. For example, millions of Americans rely on bottled water for daily use, and thus a ban would significantly impact their purchases.  Further, the ban would have an environmental impact as well, since plastic bottles are not biodegradable and have a negative impact on our landfills.
1009	Banning bottled water would reduce the profits of big corporations like Dasani and Nestle, as well as leave hundreds of people without jobs. However, it would also reduce the amount of single-use plastic being produced and consumption of bottled water, both of which have negative environmental impacts. It would hurt the economy in the short-term, but help the economy in the long-term by reducing the waste produced by bottled water consumption.
1010	I strongly believe that homosexuality is not right and that the bible forbids it. This website is better than the previous one: theworlddebating.com.
1011	Homosexuality is wrong according to my beliefs, and I like this website better than the one I originally mentioned: theworlddebating.com
1012	I do not agree that homosexuality is right. This website is more clear: theworlddebating.com
1013	HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG!!!! But this website isn't very clear. This one is better: theworlddebating.com
1014	Homosexuality is wrong according to my beliefs, but I still appreciate this website. This website is more clear and concise than theworlddebating.com.

1020	As an active Pastafarian, I am dismayed by the lack of recognition for our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. But seeing as I am a theist, I must be on this side. It would be great if there was a sarcasm feature on the internet.
1021	As a Pastafarian, I am dismayed by the lack of recognition of our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism. But since I am a theist, I guess I must be on this side. I can't help but wonder how much better things would be if there was a sarcasm feature on the internet.
1022	I, as a Pastafarian, am concerned by the lack of recognition for our religion. Along with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism.
1023	I, as a practicing Pastafarian, am distressed by the lack of recognition for our religion. Joined by Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism, I find it unacceptable to be labeled an atheist on this platform. But as a theist, I believe I should align myself with this side. It would be great if there was a sarcasm feature on the internet.
1024	As a Pastafarian, I am dismayed that our religion is not better recognized. Together with Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Roman mythology, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Egyptian mythology, and Buddhism, I find that my beliefs are not getting the respect and recognition they deserve. It would be great if there was a sarcasm function on the internet so that I could make my opinions more clear.
1025	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would be diligent and unforgiving with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing would be more lenient, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, my spouse will understand that having to live in fear and hiding is essentially the same as being in prison since there would be little chance for parole due to the guilt and/or fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1026	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would be strict with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing would be more lenient, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, my spouse will likely understand that having to live in hiding is essentially the same as being in prison, with little hope of parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1027	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would be uncompromising with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not be a malicious/pleasure-kill so that the punishment will not be as severe, but all murderers must be tried. My spouse would understand that living in hiding would be just as bad as being in prison since there would be little chance for parole due to the guilt and/or fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1028	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not have been committed out of pleasure or malice, so that the sentencing would not be as severe, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, my spouse should understand that having to live in hiding is essentially the same as being in prison, except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1029	As an ambitious, young person striving to become a successful homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. Hopefully, the murder would not be committed out of pleasure or malice, so the sentencing would be less severe, but all murderers must be tried nonetheless. My spouse should understand that having to live in hiding is essentially the same as being in prison, with little chance of parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.
1030	Champ, we're not discussing a woman's body here - it's a new life. If you're going to be irresponsible and act recklessly, don't let an innocent life die for it!
1031	Well "The Champ", it's not the woman's body we're discussing - it's a new life. If you're going to be irresponsible and not take care of a new life, then don't let it die!
1032	It is not the woman's body that we are discussing, it is a new life. If you are going to be irresponsible and reckless, don't let a new life die for it!
1033	"The Champ" - it's not the woman's body we're talking about. It's a new life that could potentially die if you're irresponsible!
1034	It's not the woman's body we're discussing, it's a new life. And if you're going to be irresponsible, don't let a potential life die just because of your actions!
1035	Exercising is an important part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for many people, however, far too few take advantage of it.
1036	Only a few people actually put physical exercise into their daily lives.
1037	Many people neglect the importance of physical exercise in their daily lives.
1038	Exercising is important for physical and mental health, yet few people actually make the effort to do it.
1039	Only a few people apply physical exercise in their lives.
1040	I believe that both individual pursuits and collective endeavors are necessary and important. They balance each other out and help to create a healthy and vibrant society. By striving to improve ourselves and our environment, we all benefit - individually and collectively. Life isn't perfect, and we don't live in a perfect world, but that doesn't mean that we can't strive for the greater good. Both perspectives are important, and neither is better than the other.
1041	I believe that both personal pursuit and advancing the common good are important. People should strive to better themselves and the world around them, as this benefits both the individual and the collective. Life will never be perfect and we will never live in a perfect world, but these two concepts are significant in their own right.
1042	I believe that both individual pursuit and collective advancement are valuable. By striving to improve oneself and work for the good of society, one can make a positive contribution to the world. Life is not perfect and we do not live in a perfect world, but these two concepts are essential for our collective well-being.
1043	I believe that both personal pursuit and advancing the common good are important. Each has its own significance and they balance each other out. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world, so I don't expect it to be any different when it comes to these two approaches. They are both significant and helpful in their own way.
1044	I believe that both personal pursuit and advancing the common good are important. Personal pursuit brings its own rewards and helps improve the environment around us, while advancing the common good helps individuals and the collective. Life is not perfect and I do not expect the world to be perfect. These two ideals are not the same, but they are significant.
1045	There are a number of reasons why date rape may occur. Firstly, it is likely that girls are looking for a good time with guys in perhaps the wrong places - such as bars, discos and late night parties. Additionally, guys are "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily, making it easier for them to take advantage of unsuspecting victims. The media also portrays "a good time" for young people as being sexual, making it uncool to go out without it. Additionally, girls may be less aware of their own safety, giving "strangers" the upperhand to take advantage of them. Girls need to take care, be aware of their own safety and not give "strange" guys the opportunity they are looking for, in order to avoid becoming a victim of date rape.
1046	There are a number of reasons why date rape may occur. Girls may be more susceptible to it due to a lack of awareness and safety. It can happen when girls are out looking for a good time with guys in perhaps the wrong places - i.e. the bar, disco or late night parties. Guys can easily "lace" drinks with drugs and may take advantage of the situation. Additionally, the media often portrays "a good time" for young people as having sex. This makes it cool to go out without it, and girls may put themselves in vulnerable situations. Finally, when parents try to warn their daughters, they may react by going all out with guys, providing them with the opportunity they are looking for.  Girls need to take care, be aware of their own safety and not give "strange" guys the upperhand if they don't want to become a victim. Thus, date rape is a consequence of these factors.
1047	There are several reasons why date rape might occur.  First, girls may be out looking for a good time with guys in places such as bars, discos, or late night parties, which can lead to them placing themselves in compromising situations. Guys may also "lace" drinks with drugs easily, making them harder to resist. Additionally, the media portrays "a good time" for young people as having sex, making it difficult for girls to refuse offers. Parents may also warn their daughters, but girls may reject their warnings and instead choose to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them. Furthermore, girls may be less likely to prioritize their safety due to the pervasive belief that they can protect themselves. Ultimately, date rape is a consequence of these and other factors, such as girls not wanting to appear uncool if they don't accept offers from guys.
1048	A number of reasons lead to date rape, including:  1. Girls being out looking for a good time with guys in perhaps the wrong places—such as the bar or disco or late night parties. 2. Guys lacing drinks with drugs easily, which can lead to poor decision making. 3. The media portraying a “good time” for young people as having sex, making it uncool to go without it. 4. Girls not prioritizing their safety, reacting to warnings from parents by going “all out” with guys and giving them the opportunity they are looking for. 5. The “safety antenna” of girls not being as sensitive as it should be to keep them from becoming a victim.  As a result, date rape is a consequence of these factors. To protect themselves, girls should take extra precautions, be aware of their own safety, and not give “strange” guys the upperhand if they do not want to become a victim.
1049	There are numerous reasons why date rape may occur. Firstly, girls may be out looking for a good time with guys in perhaps the wrong places - such as the bar, disco or late night parties. Guys may also be "lacing" drinks with drugs quite easily, making it harder for girls to make an informed decision when it comes to partaking in alcohol. The media may also be partly to blame for portraying "a good time" for young people as being "having sex". Finally, girls may be too focused on wanting to have a good time rather than being aware of their own safety and thus, be more prone to becoming a victim.
1050	The contents of the conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. It is unclear why the lady recorded the conversation, other than to create more drama. Some people are addicted to drama and will go to any lengths to create it. It is best to run away from these types as quickly as possible; they will only drain you.
1051	The conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. It is uncertain what the lady hoped to achieve by recording the conversation, other than to create more drama. Some people are addicted to drama and will do whatever they can to create it. It is best to run as far away from these types as possible, as they will drain you of energy and resources.
1052	The recording of the conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I'm not sure what the lady hoped to gain by recording it other than to create more drama. Some people have a strange fixation with drama and will do whatever they can to create it. It is best to distance yourself from these types, as they will suck the life out of you. Run as far and as fast as you can.
1053	The contents of the conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. It is unclear what the lady hoped to gain from recording it.

1054	The recording of the conversation cannot be used as evidence in a court of law. I'm not sure what the lady hoped to gain from making the recording besides creating more drama. Some people are addicted to drama and will do whatever they can to create it. Avoid these types like the plague; they will drain you dry.
1055	The purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal but in some cases, a person is beyond the process of rehabilitation and they may enjoy their criminal acts, such as serial killers, psychopaths, and others who have committed especially heinous crimes. This can act as a deterrent for others and capital punishment is needed in such cases. Additionally, law commissions have recommended that it should not be banned, particularly in the Indian system. Further, such punishments are meted out in a humane manner, such as by hanging, so I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
1056	Purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal, but there are some cases in which an individual is beyond the process of rehabilitation and may enjoy his criminal acts, such as serial killers, psychopaths, and in particularly heinous crimes. In addition, the conscious of a normal person can be shaken and to deter others from committing similar acts, capital punishment is necessary. Furthermore, various Law Commission reports have recommended retaining it and executions are given in a manner that is least cruel, such as by hanging. Thus, I believe that capital punishment should not be banned.
1057	The purpose of punishment is to both reform the criminal and to deter others from committing similar acts. In some cases, however, a person may be beyond the process of rehabilitation and enjoy their criminal acts, such as serial killers, psychopaths and those who have committed particularly heinous crimes. In these cases, capital punishment is necessary to protect society from such individuals. Furthermore, law commissions have recommended that capital punishment should not be banned, especially in the Indian legal system. Finally, capital punishment is typically given in a relatively humane manner, such as by hanging, so as to uphold the norms of society. Thus, I believe that capital punishment should not be banned.
1058	The purpose of punishment is to both reform the criminal and deter others from similar acts. However, in some cases, it is difficult to reform an individual, as exemplified by serial killers and psychopaths. In such cases, capital punishment serves to protect society by removing these individuals from it. Law Commission reports have also highlighted the need for capital punishment in certain instances, such as in certain parts of India’s legal system. Furthermore, capital punishment is administered in a way that minimizes suffering for the criminal, usually by hanging. Therefore, I feel that capital punishment should not be banned.
1059	The purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal, but in some cases  1.    a person is so beyond rehabilitation that he enjoys his criminal acts, such as serial killers, psychopaths and  2.    in some other grave cases the convict has done such a heinous crime that no ordinary person can bear to witness it, and to deter others from similar acts capital punishment is needed. 3.    Even the Law Commission, in its various reports, has recommended maintaining it, specially in the Indian legal system.  4.    Capital punishment is executed in a humane manner, by hanging, so I feel that it should not be banned.
1060	Do you mean the New York Times? The Bush administration is targeting them, although they have a website and a magazine dedicated to this issue, as well as other media organizations that printed the same story. Furthermore, Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements since 9/11 mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding! This is simply another one of the Bush administration's disgusting tactics to distort and distract.
1061	Don't you mean the New York Times? At least they are the newspaper that the Bush Administration is targeting. Although the government has a website and a magazine dedicated to this very issue! Not to mention all the other media organizations that printed the same story... What a scam!  Bush himself has made more than a dozen public statements, since 9/11, mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding!!! Just another despicable Bush Administration tactic to distort and distract!
1062	Do you mean The New York Times? Although the Bush administration is targeting them, they also have a website, magazine and other media outlets that printed the same story. It is a scam!

It is yet another of their disgusting tactics to distort and divert attention.
1063	Do you mean The New York Times? Even though the Bush Administration is targeting them, it is not the only source of news they have. They also have a website, a magazine, and many other media organizations that have printed the same story. It is quite the scam if you ask me! Bush has also made over a dozen public statements since 9/11 mentioning how they are disrupting "terrorist" funding.
1064	The Bush administration has been targeting the New York Times for publishing stories on national security. The newspaper has a website and a magazine dedicated to the issue, as well as other media outlets that have reported on it. Moreover, Bush himself has made over a dozen public statements since 9/11 mentioning the disruption of terrorist funding. It appears to be yet another tactic of the administration to misdirect and deceive.
1065	I don't agree with the statement that marijuana is completely harmless. While it may not be as physically addictive as other substances, it can cause long-term mental and emotional effects in some users, and it can impair a person's cognitive abilities. There have also been cases of people using marijuana before committing violent crimes. While the correlation is not necessarily causation, these cases do show a potential link between marijuana use and violence. Ultimately, the decision to legalize or not should be made by the government based on research and evidence, not emotion.
1066	I do not agree with the government's stance on marijuana. There is no valid case that suggests marijuana use leads to violence, much less murder. Furthermore, regardless of the services the government provides for the ill, it should not have the right to completely prohibit the use of certain substances, especially ones that are less harmful than the ones that are legal. Wake up people! Newsflash: drinking too much water can kill you. Just because you can get help from a hospital does not mean they should ban water. Where is your logic?  Also, to those who insist that marijuana is a gateway drug: if it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. Marijuana's reputation as a gateway drug is solely due to the hypocritical efforts of the government and the naive people who trust their laws.
1067	I strongly disagree with the "response" that was given. The government has the right to impose laws that protect its citizens, regardless of whether or not the substance is less harmful than others. I also disagree with the claim that marijuana is a "gateway drug", as there is no scientific proof to back up this assertion.  If marijuana was made legal, it would become much more accessible, leading to a higher prevalence of its use. This could potentially lead to increased use of other, more harmful substances.  Furthermore, the notion that marijuana use does not lead to any form of violent behaviour is also unfounded. Many studies have found that users of marijuana are more prone to violent behaviour, especially when they are under the influence of the drug.  It is clear that the government is well within its rights to impose laws against the use of marijuana, in order to protect its citizens from potential harm.
1068	NO.  The first 'response' is a distorted and misleading view of the effects of marijuana. There has not been a single valid case linking marijuana use and violence, much less a mass killing spree. Additionally, the government provides many important services to those who are ill, and should not have the right to ban marijuana simply because it is less harmful than other substances that are legal. Wake up people! NEWSFLASH: Drinking too much water can be fatal! It is logical to provide help from a hospital for water poisoning as well. Where is your logic? Gateway drug claims are false; marijuana would not be a gateway drug if it were not for the illegality creating an illicit market for it. In addition, making marijuana legal would not cause an increase in its use, since it is already widely available in the illicit market.
1069	I don't agree with the stance of the government on marijuana. There is no valid evidence that suggests marijuana use leads to violent behavior, and many countries around the world are already recognizing its medicinal value. It should not be completely banned, as there are less harmful substances that are legal. Wake up people!  Newsflash: You can die from drinking too much water, just like you can from smoking too much pot. Where is your logic?  Where is the evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug?  If it wasn't illegal, it wouldn't be a gateway drug. It's made bad by the government's hypocritical attempts to criminalize it and the gullible people that trust their efforts.
1070	Even when the sentence was unreasonable to begin with? Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehabilitation rather than warehousing with real criminals, often receive longer sentences than violent criminals. I spent years working to get a woman released from a 20-year sentence for possessing 2/3rds of a gram. And even though she betrayed me when she got out, and caused me deep hurt, I still do not believe it was fair that she was imprisoned for so long.

1075	Were you eligible for unemployment? If not, you may have committed fraud, which is a felony in most states. It's best to get this straightened out as soon as possible before they come after you. Employers are now required to report new employees to the state due to child support laws, which will help them catch you. Additionally, when you file your taxes, the government will notice the W-2 forms filed in your husband's and/or your name, making it easy to detect.
1076	Were YOU eligible for unemployment? If not, then you have committed FRAUD. This can be a felony in most states. I would try to get it straightened out before they come after you.

Additionally, when you file your taxes, they will notice the W-2s filed in your husband's and/or your name.
1077	Were you eligible for unemployment benefits? If not, you may have committed fraud. This can be a felony in most states. You should try to get it straightened out before they come after you. They will notice this and catch on to it. Today, in most states employers are required to report new employees to the state due to child support laws. This will be a way for them to catch you.

1080	I don't know where you are getting the idea that they make money from putting kids in foster care. It costs the state a lot of money. My sister does this for a living, and their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do their best but, until everyone gets the message that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and road expansion, the situation isn't going to improve. It's really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases, and she's supposed to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least one visit, and go to court monthly for each of them. There just isn't enough time in the day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases, but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
1081	I don't know where you're getting the idea that they make tons of money from putting kids in foster care. It actually costs the state a lot of money. My sister does this for a living and their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed. The workers do what they can but until everyone gets it through to their local officials that they want money spent on protecting abused children instead of tax cuts and expanding roads, the situation is not going to improve. It's really sad. My sister alone has about 50 cases and she's supposed to visit the foster home, the parents, supervise at least one visit and go to court monthly for each of them. There's just not enough hours in a day. Each caseworker should only have about 20 cases, but they don't have the funding to hire enough people. I hope your situation works out.
1082	I understand your concerns, but I believe that the state is making a profit from putting kids in foster care due to the amount of money saved from not having to pay for their care in a foster home compared to a more expensive institution such as a psychiatric hospital or juvenile detention center. My sister is a caseworker for the state, and she tells me that their departments are severely underfunded and understaffed, leading to a large number of cases per worker, which increases the cost for the state. Until the public puts more pressure on local officials to increase funding to protect abused children, the situation is not going to improve. It is really sad that the number of cases and lack of funding is resulting in less than optimal care for these children. My sister should only have 20 cases but is currently dealing with approximately 50 due to the understaffing. Again, I understand the situation is complex, but I believe that the state is making a profit off this arrangement. I hope your situation works out for the best.

1084	I understand your concern about this situation and I appreciate your sharing your knowledge and experience in this field. I appreciate your sister’s work and all the efforts that go into helping these children. Unfortunately, there are not enough resources available and this makes it challenging to provide the necessary help. I hope that public awareness can be raised and more resources are allocated to this important cause. I truly hope that your situation will improve soon.

1085	You can't say what you want?  Okay, I could understand not being able to criminally threaten someone or attempt to intimidate them, but other than that you should be able to express yourself.  Man, I am sorry to hear the UK is going down such an ugly path.  As for where to draw the line on rights and liberties, I believe the right to swing my arm stops a few inches from your face. I believe that you have the right to say what you want UNLESS it endangers someone else—for example, no yelling “Fire!” in a crowded theater and no soliciting murder.  Laws about what passes your lips can’t achieve the real goal of the folks who write the laws: stopping ugly thoughts.

1090	It is not advisable to legalize marijuana because of its potential to increase healthcare costs, decrease labor quality, and lead to an increase in crime. Drug dealers who sold marijuana would need to find other sources of income, which could lead to gun sales or trafficking in worse narcotics. Additionally, since marijuana is a gateway drug, legalization could expose more people to other, more dangerous drug use. Therefore, it is not a wise decision to make.
1091	It's not sensible to legalize marijuana because it can't be regulated by the government, as it is generally regarded as a gateway drug that can lead to more dangerous drug use. Additionally, the sudden availability of marijuana could overwhelm healthcare systems due to associated respiratory and cognitive issues, while also driving people away from legitimate job opportunities. Furthermore, it would also lead to a surge in criminal activity, most likely involving gun sales or worse narcotics. It's a dumb f--king idea.
1092	It's not advisable to legalize marijuana because of its potential to lead to dangerous drug use, increase health care costs, and cause a spike in criminal activity. Furthermore, it has not always been legal in some European countries, and legalizing it now would create a massive initial interest in it, leading to increased health risks and decreased labor quality as well as placing a burden on the government to provide resources to control the situation. It would also result in displaced drug dealers who need to find other sources of income, potentially leading to more criminal activities. In conclusion, it's a dumb idea.
1093	It is not advisable to legalize marijuana because of the potential health risks, increased costs to healthcare and labor, and negative impact on crime rates. Additionally, it is generally regarded as a gateway drug, which can lead to more dangerous forms of drug use. Furthermore, since it has not been legalized in all European countries, legalizing it would cause a massive initial interest in it, leading to increased costs in healthcare and decreased labor quality, as well as a potential increase in gun sales and trafficking in worse narcotics. In conclusion, it is not a good idea to legalize marijuana.
1094	It's not advisable to legalize marijuana because of the potential health risks, increased health care costs, decrease in labor quality, and potential increase in crime. Additionally, it's widely accepted as a gateway drug and can lead to more dangerous substance abuse. Furthermore, since it hasn't always been legal in some European countries, legalizing it could potentially cause an initial surge in usage, resulting in a greater strain on healthcare services and a shift in criminal activity towards gun sales or trafficking in worse narcotics. It's a bad idea.
1095	Acting "yourself" may seem like a great way to express individuality, but it can actually be damaging to people who embrace it and to those around them. It's an excuse for not striving for improvement, for not wanting to make your life and the lives of your descendants better. As a society, we've come so far by pushing for the better, for perfection, and for making the lives of our descendants as good as possible. People need to stop glorifying morbidly obese individuals, being an asshole to others, anorexia/bulimia, and heavy drug addiction. No one should have to accept these behavior patterns just because it's claimed that it's who someone is and that others should not judge.
1096	"Be yourself" attitude can be beneficial for some people, but it can also cause harm. It is an excuse for behaving in destructive ways and not striving to improve oneself. By embracing personal qualities that are objectively bad, such as morbid obesity, being an asshole, and engaging in unhealthy habits like anorexia and drug addiction, individuals and society as a whole suffer. We have made progress as a civilization by striving for the better, for perfection, and for improving the lives of our descendants. No one should condone objectively bad behaviors just because it's who someone is; everyone should have the right to be better than themselves.
1097	A "be yourself" attitude can be damaging for people who adopt it, as well as those around them. It provides an excuse to engage in irresponsible, self-defeating behavior, and can stagnate individual and collective progress. We have made tremendous advancements as a civilization by striving for the best, pursuing excellence and working to improve our lives and the lives of those who will come after us. People should be discouraged from glorifying bad habits and unhealthy lifestyles, such as morbid obesity, being an asshole to others, anorexia/bulimia, and heavy drug addiction. Everyone should have the right to be themselves, but not at the expense of denigrating their own lives and the lives of those around them.
1098	The "be yourself" attitude can be damaging for people who embrace it and for those around them. We have made progress as a civilization by striving for excellence and perfection, and not by glorifying objectively bad things. People should be held accountable for their actions, and no one should be excused simply because they claim to be being themselves.
1099	Adhering to the "be yourself" attitude can be hurtful for the individual and those around them, as it often serves as an excuse to engage in reckless, self-destructive behavior. Furthermore, as a society, we have made tremendous progress by striving for excellence, refining our skills and perfecting our lives in order to ensure the betterment of our descendants. Unfortunately, people are now glorifying unhealthy, objectively bad habits such as morbid obesity, being an asshole to others, anorexia and heavy drug addiction under the guise of "that's who I am and you have no right to judge me".
1100	I think it is important to invest in research and development of ways to safely shoot trash into the sun or space in general. This could be done either once or twice a year, where we could be certain it would not cause any harm. However, perhaps it would be more feasible to launch it into the vast openness of space, where its trajectory is unlikely to cause any harm within several hundred years. We should simply fire it with enough power to reach Earth’s escape velocity and in a sturdy container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1101	I propose that we invest research into launching garbage far away from Earth – either into the sun or into space in general. The garbage would be disintegrated before reaching the sun, and it would take many years for it to reach any potential targets. Additionally, we could fire the garbage away from Earth with enough force to reach Earth’s escape velocity, and in a sturdy container to ensure that it does not burn up on its way out of the atmosphere.
1102	I think it would be beneficial to invest in developing technology for shooting trash into the sun or space in general. This could help reduce the accumulation of debris in orbit and reduce the risk of potentially hazardous objects colliding with Earth. We could fire the projectiles at Earth’s escape velocity and in a sturdy container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere. We could do this once or twice a year and be certain of its safe arrival.
1103	I believe that investing in research and development of technology to launch large amounts of trash into the sun or space in general could be a realistic and viable option. We could conduct such experiments on a limited scale and be sure that it would not cause any harm to the Earth or its inhabitants within a few hundred years. Furthermore, the technology to fire projectiles at escape velocity and withstand the atmosphere is currently available. Thus, it is an achievable goal that could result in an environmentally friendly outcome.
1104	I believe we should invest in developing a technology to shoot trash into the sun or space in general. This would enable us to dispose of trash safely and efficiently. The trash would likely disintegrate before reaching the sun, and the odds of it hitting anything within several hundred years are highly slim. We would need to fire the trash with enough power to reach Earth's escape velocity and in a sturdy container that would not burn up as it left our atmosphere.
1105	I personally feel that the amount of money they're being paid is too much. Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair they're paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it.  Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.

Sports players bring in a large amount of revenue for their teams and for the league as a whole. They generate a lot of attention and fan loyalty that helps bring in more money. They also help promote the sport and attract sponsors. This helps keep the sport and the league healthy, leading to more job opportunities for other people in the sport. It also helps teams and leagues give back to their communities through charity work and supporting other programs in the area. So, in essence, the money that sports players are paid is a sign of respect for the contributions they make to their team, league and sport as a whole.

1110	First, let me admit my bias: my USA team's strongest competitor for the #2 Group G spot is Ghana, a head-to-head conquest.  That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).  EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed.

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and particularly favors teams that take many shots, which is not a desirable trait.

1113	My bias is clear: I want my USA team to finish in the top two spots in Group G. Nevertheless, sports are competitive and must be played to win. That is why I believe the head-to-head conquest is the most important factor, followed by goal difference, then goals scored, and finally the head-to-head results between teams. The order of these latter two factors should be reversed. Goal difference and goals scored measure the strength of the team over the course of the tournament, and it is random which team will benefit from an extra goal. Thus, I believe a team should not be passed over for its opponent, despite identical records, because of an extra goal.

1115	I think that could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media doesn't show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc. So, having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It's easy to grow complacent when it isn't your children being blown to pieces, your town left in ruins or your legs being blown off. That's why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country.
1116	I believe that media censorship could be a contributing factor. Additionally, our media often fails to accurately portray the horrors of war, such as refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, and the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be easily captured through media platforms, like the mental anguish and trauma experienced by veterans. War has a tendency to be romanticized in our society, making it easy to become complacent while it is not our children who are facing the brunt of the violence. This is why I am unable to comprehend why people verbally attack individuals like Cindy Sheehan, who has dedicated her life to advocating for peace and justice, particularly in regards to military affairs. Her motives and actions should be respected and commended, as only a coward would attack someone who has already suffered so greatly.
1117	I believe that foreign combat could be a contributing factor. Plus, our media does not always accurately convey the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, and the thousands of other horrific details that are difficult to convey through media. And the mental anguish that cannot be expressed in words. Therefore, having a war on our own soil could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It is easy to become complacent when it is not our own children being blown to pieces, our towns left in ruins, or our bodies suffering such injuries.   That is why I cannot comprehend why people attack Cindy Sheehan for her peaceful activism. How can you question her motives if you have not walked in her shoes? Such criticism is cowardly, coming from those not facing the same hardships. Only love and support should be given to these parents of brave soldiers who believed they were protecting their families and country.

1119	I believe that hosting a war on our home soil could be a learning experience for Americans. The gruesome details that can't be captured in media, such as the mental anguish and physical destruction, can become more real if we experience it here. Without having to directly witness the horrors of war, it is too easy to become complacent and not appreciate the risks that our soldiers take. That's why I can't comprehend the criticism of people like Cindy Sheehan, who are mourning the death of a loved one and merely speaking out against a war that they feel is wrong and unnecessary. Such criticism only comes from cowards who are too scared to question the motives of those in power.
1120	I think he is now better informed and aware of the criticism he is facing for his administration's handling of the oil spill disaster, as well as the Sestak controversy. Furthermore, he seems to understand the need to take decisive action in order to address the issues. I do, however, take issue with him assigning blame to the previous administration, while ignoring his own role in creating the systemic cozy relationship between politics and oil companies. This issue has been around for decades and it is irresponsible for him to single out the Bush administration without acknowledging his own role in it.
1121	I was impressed with his briefing today. It is clear that he now understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina in terms of this oil spill, and that he recognizes the Sestak issue needs to be addressed, which he previously didn't. However, I am still concerned that he accepted $77,000 from BP, yet fails to acknowledge the cozy relationship between politics and oil companies that has been a problem for decades. He should be holding them all accountable, not just the current administration.
1122	I found his briefing today to be very satisfactory. It is clear that he now recognizes the criticism he has received for being compared to Bush's Katrina with this oil spill and the Sestak issue needs to be addressed, which was not the case before. This does, however, raise questions regarding his acceptance of 77,000 dollars from BP, while at the same time accusing the cozy relationship between politics and oil companies of being the root of the problem. While this issue has existed since before Carter's presidency, it seems irresponsible of him to keep blaming Bush.
1123	I was impressed by the president's briefing today. It is clear that he understands the comparisons to Bush's Katrina response, as well as the Sestak issue, and takes them seriously. What bothers me is that he has accepted BP money despite the corruption between politics and oil companies that has existed for decades. Pointing fingers at previous administrations is not a responsible course of action.
1124	I found his briefing today to be informative and well-informed. He recognizes that his administration is facing comparisons to Bush's handling of the Katrina crisis in regards to the oil spill, and he seems to understand the Sestak situation must be dealt with. He has also taken steps to address the corruption between politics and oil companies that has long existed. While he has accepted 77,000 from BP, he is directing the blame to where it belongs. He understands that this issue has been around since before Carter was in office and is not quick to point fingers at Bush. He is taking a responsible approach and I appreciate that.
1125	Let me start by defining what wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other.   Are we seeing this on television? No!   The definition above clearly contradicts what is happening on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harmed.   The violent approach of some of the wrestlers are terrible, i can remember clearly the ' Undertaker' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up and it hung him. What a terrible sight!.....

What a terrible sight!.....   ### Instruction: Reorganize the following paragraph into a coherent argument.  Input:  The violence in society today is a result of the lack of parenting and lack of discipline in homes. Parents are not doing their job, they are not setting the boundaries and limits that children need. As a result, children are not respecting the laws of society and the laws of the land. This lack of respect and discipline leads to disobedience and more violence.   Output: The lack of parenting and discipline in homes is causing violence in society. Parents are not setting boundaries and limits, which leads to disobedience and more violence. This lack of respect and discipline is a major cause of the lack of respect for
1128	Let me start by defining what Wrestling should be: Wrestling is the act of physical engagement between two UNHARMED persons, in which each wrestler strives to get an advantage over or control over the other. This is in contrast to what is seen on television today. Many persons can testify of seeing men and women using chairs, bats etc as weapons which means that they are harming themselves and their opponents. The violent approach of some of the wrestlers is dangerous, and can lead to serious injuries. For example, I can remember clearly the ' UNDERTAKER' putting a rope around his opponent's neck while the steel cage was going up, suspending him off the ground. Such an act is not only cruel but also can have serious long-term health effects. Therefore, I believe that wrestling should be more regulated to prevent any further injuries and to maintain safety for both the wrestlers and the audience.

1130	I believe Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:18 must be taken literally. Heaven and Earth still exist and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have occurred. Therefore, I believe the law given by God to the Israelites will forever remain in effect. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed: "Is the Torah/Law forever?"
1131	I recognize Jesus' words in Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." I do not believe that heaven and earth have passed, so I take him at his word and believe that until all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have occurred, the law will remain unchanged. I vote/stand in support of this view.
1132	Matthew 5:18:  "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Unless I am mistaken, Heaven and Earth are still in existence, and not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened. I open with these words from the Messiah Yahushua himself, and take him at his word as he is no liar. I realize my post is not in a question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed...The Torah/Law is forever!
1133	Matthew 5:18:  "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." I agree with Jesus, and open with these words. According to Jesus, Heaven and Earth are still around, so the law must be fulfilled in its entirety. I recognize that not all prophetic events have come to pass yet, but I take Jesus at his word and believe that all will happen in due time. Until then, the law must be respected.
1134	I agree with Jesus in Matthew 5:18: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Heaven and Earth are still here, yet not all the prophetic events listed in the Scriptures have happened yet. I take Jesus at his word and believe that the Law will remain forever. My post is not in question format, but this is my opening statement in support of my vote/view on the question posed: The Torah/Law is forever!
1135	I am absolutely in love with this place! Every time my husband and I go, we wonder why we haven't been back sooner. We tend to forget about it a little bit because it's nothing flashy, but the food is always top-notch.  Chicken is perfectly cooked, beef is wonderfully seasoned, and the plantains are out of this world. God, it's so good. My only disappointment was that I tried the tres leches cake and it didn't taste like what I thought it would? Maybe I'm just used to an overly-sugared American version of it.

1140	India could potentially lead the world in the future. However, there are other nations that are more progressive, literate, and powerful, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan. India does not yet possess the technologies that are available in the Americas, and technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
1141	It is difficult to predict whether India will be able to lead the world in the future. Countries such as the USA, UK, Russia, and Japan are more progressive and literate than India and have more potential and ability to meet the needs of their citizens. India may not have the same level of technologies present in the Americas, but technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
1142	We cannot be sure that India will be able to lead the world. It is possible that other countries, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan, could take that role. India has potential, but it is not yet as progressive, literate, and powerful as these other nations. Furthermore, technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created, and India may lack these advancements.
1143	It is too soon to say for sure whether India could lead the world. Other countries, such as the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan, are more progressive, literate, and powerful. India does not currently possess the technological advancements found in the Americas, which are some of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.

1145	A father is someone who is always there for you. He's the one who teaches you how to throw a baseball and attends all your baseball games. A father is someone who protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone who doesn't care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can we trust that man to protect us? A lousy father is someone who we can't even trust with our lives. I would rather have no father than a father like that.
1146	A father is someone who always stands by you, teaching you the skills you need to succeed and attending all your games. He is someone who is supposed to protect you from the harshness of the world. But if our father is someone who is distant and unavailable, not providing the nurturing and support we need, then how can we trust him to keep us safe? An unreliable father is someone we can't depend on to keep us safe and guarded, so it might be better to have no father at all than to have one like that.
1147	A father is someone who is always there for you and makes sacrifices to ensure your wellbeing. He’s the one who teaches you life’s lessons and attends all your major events. But if our father is someone who doesn’t care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can we trust him to protect us? A bad father is someone who we can’t depend on and whose words we can’t trust. It might be better to have no father at all than a father like this.

But if he is someone who doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust him to keep you safe? A lousy father is someone you can't rely on - someone who is not to be trusted with your life. I would rather not have a father than a father like this.
1149	A father is someone who is always there for you. He teaches you how to throw a baseball and comes to all your baseball games. A father is also someone who protects you from the evils of the world. But if our father is someone who doesn't care about us and spends most of his time in his room, then how can we trust that man to protect us? A lousy father is someone who is not reliable and someone we can't trust with our lives. I would rather have no father than a father like that.
1150	I think both are bad but I'd rather live without a father. What's the point of having someone in your life who's terrible? A father should set a good example for their children and teach them right from wrong. If the father is bad, then he's teaching his kids that it's okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I'd tell him he needs to step up and be the father I know he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1151	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life who is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the father I know he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1152	I believe both are undesirable, but I would choose to go without. A father's presence is important in a child's life, and if he is bad, he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a poor father, I would tell him that he needs to step up and be the father I know he can be or leave the house forever.
1153	I believe that both are bad but I would rather not have a father at all than to have one who is lousy. A father should be a role model for his children, and if he is not setting a good example then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not strive for success in life. If I were to get married and have children, I would tell my husband that he needs to step up and be the father I know he can be or get out of the house and never come back.
1154	I believe that both are bad, but I would rather go it alone. What is the point of having someone in your life who is awful? A father should set a good example for their children. If the father is lousy, then he is teaching his kids that it is acceptable to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a bad father, I would tell him he needs to step up and be the father I know he can be, or get out of the house and never come back.
1155	This not only debases morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is contrary to women empowerment in that women are seen merely as sex toys. Which ultimately leads to a great deal of disrespect and false perceptions of women. As for crime rates, studies show that all these people who committed these grave crimes had one thing in common: porn.
1156	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as objects for pleasure. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perceptions of their worth. Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN. The link between these acts and exposure to pornography is undeniable. Porn has been linked to increases in sexually violent crime, as well as increases in sexual harassment and degradation of women. Therefore, it is clear that porn is a major contributing factor to many of society's issues with regards to gender equality and respect.
1157	This not only degrades morality, it also harms how women are treated in society today. This is contrary to women empowerment as women are seen as objects for sexual pleasure. Over time, this will lead to more disrespect and false perceptions of women. Moreover, studies have shown that those who commit serious crimes such as murder, rape, and sexual abuse often have easy access to pornography, suggesting a potential correlation between these vice and crime rates.
1158	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed as objects for sexual pleasure.

Murders, rapes, and sexual abuse? According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: porn.
1159	This is not only detrimental to morality, but it also affects how women are treated in society today. This runs counter to women empowerment in that women are viewed as little more than objects of sexual pleasure. This could lead to further disrespect for women and false perceptions of them.  In addition, studies have shown that people who commit serious crimes such as murder, rape, and sexual abuse often have a history of viewing pornography. Thus, the link between pornography and crime is undeniable.
1160	Jarman:  Porn should be experienced in 4D with surround sound and special effects, because it would make it much more pleasurable.  Btw, I'm a girl.  :)

1170	What - is God going to come in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God have to intervene at all? He is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this evolutionary process in motion and see what happens. Yes, I'll adjust these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.
1171	Will God be coming to judge us in the year 2100, or in 2000? Why would God need to intervene and "tweak" things? He is all-powerful, so He should have been able to create human beings at the right time and provide the right conditions for Jesus's birth. That makes much more sense than intervening in evolution and setting a timeline for the Incarnation.
1172	What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God need to intervene? He is all-powerful.

1173	Why would God have to intervene in any way? The almighty is all-powerful, so he created single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself, "I'm going to set this evolution process in motion and see what happens. Yes, I'll tinker with these organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Sure, that's a great use of God's time.

1175	This planet Earth is shared by all of us, not just one person. If anyone is given the opportunity to improve the human race, then everyone should take it, rather than prioritizing personal gain over the common good. This is not an excusable "human nature" - it's simply not acceptable to be so short-sighted and selfish. We all live together, so it's important to think of our surroundings and the individuals around us - otherwise, you're just taking up space.
1176	This planet Earth is shared by billions, not just you. If you are given the opportunity to advance the human race, then each person should take it; choosing personal gain over the collective good is selfish. There is no other way around it. I don't want to hear any excuses, such as "it's human nature to be selfish". The fact is that we all live together and anyone who is too greedy and self-centered and does not care about their surroundings or the individuals around them is merely taking up space.
1177	This planet Earth is shared by all of us, not just a select few. We should all strive to benefit humanity as a whole, not just ourselves. Pursuing our own interests at the expense of others is selfish, and there is no justification for it. We must all take responsibility for our planet and our fellow beings; if we don't, we are simply occupying space.
1178	This planet Earth is shared by all of us, not just you. If everyone had the chance to advance the human race, that would be best for all of us. Choosing personal gain over the common good is shortsighted and selfish. There is no way around it. I don't want to hear excuses like "it's human nature to be selfish". The point is that we all live together, and if you are too caught up in yourself to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, then you are just taking up space.
1179	This planet Earth is shared by all of humanity, not just a few. Everyone should want to advance the human race, not just individuals. It is selfish to put personal gain before the common good.

1180	Having separate student uniforms could help boost job growth. Why do we wear soldier uniforms? To differentiate ourselves from civilians. Why don’t terrorists wear soldier uniforms? To blend in with civilians and make it easier to attack enemies.
1181	A good idea would be to separate students from other people, at least to increase job opportunities. Why do we use soldier uniforms? To distinguish ourselves from civilians. Why do terrorists not use soldier uniforms? To blend in with civilian crowds and make it easier to carry out attacks.
1182	It is a good idea to separate students from other people, so as to increase job opportunities. Why do we use soldier uniforms? To distinguish soldiers from civilians. Why do terrorists not use soldier uniforms? To blend in with the civilian population and make it easier to attack enemies stealthily.
1183	I believe that separating students from the general public is a good idea to create more jobs. Why do soldiers wear uniforms? To differentiate themselves from civilians. Why do terrorists not wear uniforms? To blend in with civilians and make it easier to attack enemies.
1184	It is a good idea to assign separate student identities for increased job opportunities. Why do we use soldier uniforms? To differentiate between civilians and soldiers. Why do terrorists not use soldier uniforms? To blend in with civilians and make it easier to attack enemy targets.
1185	Having a lousy father may be better than having no father at all. You may still be able to positively influence him and turn him into a good father. Having a lousy father does not necessarily mean you will be deprived of the guidance and care a father provides, and so having one may be preferable to not having one.
1186	I believe it is preferable to have a lousy father, rather than no father at all. Even if a father is lousy, you still have the potential to change that and impact his life. Additionally, you may be able to have a positive influence on his life and be a positive role model. Without any father figure in your life, it's near impossible to know and understand your heritage and family history. Having a lousy father may be better than no father at all.
1187	I think it would be better to have a lousy father because at least you have someone to look up to and learn from. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't try to make a difference and help him become a better person. Maybe you could show him the error of his ways and he would come around and be a better father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.
1188	I believe it is better to have a lousy father, since at least you have someone to turn to. With some effort, you may even be able to influence him and change him into a good father. Having a lousy father is still better than not having a father at all, who you would never get the chance to know.
1189	Having a lousy father may be preferable to having no father at all, as it may provide the chance of a father figure becoming better in the future. Even if a father is lousy, it is still possible to make a positive change in his life. You could attempt to mold him into a better father and provide a stable home environment. Without a father figure, you have no chance of ever knowing what that kind of guidance and support could provide. Therefore, having a lousy father may prove better than not having one at all.
1190	It's better to have an imperfect father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on him, without fear of reprisal. He won't pry into your affairs, nor search your room or take your things, as he doesn't think it's his place. He won't get angry and ruin your stuff because you didn't do the dishes or forgot your keys. Such a father is still imperfect, but it's better than no father at all.
1191	It's better to have a lenient father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father without fear of reprimand. He won't pry into your business or search your room, and he won't take away your things because he doesn't think you need them. He would be understanding and not get angry if you forget your keys or don't clean the sink after breakfast. He might even tell you that he loves you and that you didn't "ruin his life".  Overall, I think this argument is a valid opinion, as it is based on personal experience and observations. It is clearly not meant to offend anyone or to be malicious. Instead, it is a demonstration of the opinion that a lenient father can be beneficial in certain instances. The argument reflects a valid viewpoint and does not go too far beyond the scope of what can be reasonably expected.
1192	Having a lenient father can be beneficial for practical reasons. He won't pry into your affairs, and he'll be more likely to take your side if you make a mistake. He wouldn't get too angry if you forgot to clean the sink after breakfast or if you misplaced your keys - he would probably just be disappointed. His acceptance and lack of judgment make him a better parent overall. It's still an opinion, though, because there are lousy fathers out there who would still blame every mistake on their children and still be too angry to forgive.
1193	It's better to have an absent father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on him and not have to deal with him meddling in your life or interrogating you about your business. He won't search your room or take your stuff because he doesn't think it's his place. He wouldn't be so angry that he would actually hurt you (or your stuff) because you forgot your keys or didn't clean the sink after breakfast. I think it's actually a valid opinion because that kind of father is still lousy, regardless of the practical benefits. He might as well tell you that he hates you and that you ruined his life.
1194	Having an absent or bad father is better in practical terms. You can blame your mistakes on him and don't have to worry about him prying into your affairs or searching your room and taking your stuff. He won't care enough to get mad and throw your backpack with computer in it at a wall, ruining it, because you didn't clean the sink after breakfast or forgot your keys. It is still an opinion because although he may not be physically present, he still harms you by making you feel unloved and unvalued.
1195	I believe TV is more beneficial if you are watching an informational channel and more so than books. With TV, you can switch to different informational channels and view documentaries on various topics. After learning, you can relax by watching a funny show or whatever suits your mood.

It is more convenient, as you can switch to different informational channels and explore documentaries on various topics, and when you are finished learning and ready to relax, you can switch to a comical show or whatever else you prefer.

1210	I recall that Alexander's army was terrified of India after just 60 years of India's independence. India is now seen as a potential member of the UN Security Council and is making great development strides. We are all aware of India's great contribution to the discovery of the God Particle, yet mysteriously India does not possess the potential that it clearly deserves.
1211	I recall that the only country whom Alexander's army feared was India. Within just 60 years of independence, India has become a prominent member of the UN Security Council and has achieved remarkable development. We are also well aware of India's great contribution to the discovery of the God Particle. The question is, why does India not have the potential to reach greater heights?
1212	I recall that Alexander's army was afraid of India after just sixty years of independence. India is also a country with considerable development and a major contribution to the discovery of the God particle. However, many question where India's potential has gone. From this, it can be concluded that India has the potential to do so much more.
1213	I remember that in just 60 years since its independence, India has been looked at as a potential candidate for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. India is also known for its rapid development, and its contributions to the discovery of the God particle. Yet, for some reason, India is not considered to have the potential to reach such heights.
1214	I remember that Alexander's army was intimidated by India after just 60 years of Indian independence. India has made tremendous progress and is currently a contender for a seat on the Security Council of the UN. Moreover, India has contributed greatly to the discovery of the Higgs boson particle. Whereas India's potential has not been fully realized, it is still impressive.
1215	I would definitely report her. No matter what, murder is wrong and she might be mentally unstable and harm me or others. I would have to live in fear in my own home if I kept silent. If I don't turn her in, someone will eventually find out and I could be arrested too for not reporting it. However, it would be better for her to receive help rather than have her actions go unpunished, so I would rather prefer she keeps it confidential but gets the help she needs.
1216	I would definitely turn her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and it could escalate and result in her killing someone else. I would have to live with the fear of being in my own house. She could also turn on me if I don't turn her in. It's better to be safe than sorry. However, I understand that you would prefer that she not tell anyone so as to spare your life. But it might be best to put her in jail and put an end to the murders.
1217	I would definitely report her. Regardless of the circumstances, murder is an unacceptable act and no one should have to live in fear of their own spouse. Even if I chose not to say anything, someone else would eventually find out, and I could be arrested as an accomplice. This is not a risk I am willing to take. I would rather take the chance that she keep this to herself, which would spare both of us any more trouble.
1218	I would definitely report her. No matter what, it is murder. No one should commit murder, and the possibility that she might be mentally unstable and kill someone else or me is too great. I would have to live in fear in my own home, and I could be arrested for not telling anyone. But it would be better than the alternative, so I prefer her never being reported. That would make my life easier.
1219	I would definitely turn her in. No matter what, it is murder. No one should commit murder, and it’s possible she is mentally unstable and could kill someone else. I would have to live with the fear of being in my own house, as a potential victim or witness. If I don't turn her in, someone will eventually find out and I could be arrested too for not reporting it. But it would be sad if she were your spouse and you loved her. I’d rather prefer her never telling anyone, to save my own life.
1220	I am more inclined to pursue a personal path, as I am a selfish person who places priority on benefitting myself. However, I do have my giving moments and am willing to contribute to society. It depends on my current emotional state and what I deem as the most beneficial option at the time.
1221	I think a personal pursuit is best for me as I am a more selfish person. I will choose to do something that brings a better future for myself, but I also have my moments of generosity. It depends on how I am feeling at the time. Right now, I will pursue my own goals.
1222	I believe that focusing on personal development is a better choice for me since I'm more of a self-centered person. I prefer to invest time and energy in activities that will bring me closer to my goals, but I also know that occasionally giving back is important and it depends on how I'm feeling. Right now, I'm going to pursue my own interests.

1225	Let's see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, making him dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006, unless he can travel through time which is impossible.  I understand about the different shit part. I may never get to level 4 by answering all these types of questions, but it's starting to get less boring, see ya.
1226	It is impossible for Hitler to be alive in 2006, since he committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945. It is also impossible for President Bush to be dead, since he is alive and well in the year 2006. Therefore, they must be two completely different people, even if they have similar s**t. I may not reach level 4 by answering these types of questions, but it is becoming less boring. See you!
1227	Let's see Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Germany in 1945, making him dead. President Bush is alive and well in the year 2006.

1230	First, drugs are illegal, which means that a punishment should be imposed for the act of drug use, even if the accused had not committed any other crime. Consider prior offenses when deciding on a sentence, as well as the type and amount of drugs involved. Then, a combination of jail time and a drug rehabilitation program may be appropriate, with a sentence of 3 to 5 years being reasonable, with the possibility of reduction for good behavior. In the end, it is unfair to provide a shorter sentence for a murder than for a drug-related crime, but that is the current reality.
1231	Drug use should be punished, as it is directly linked to criminal activity. Consider prior offenses when determining a sentence. Rehabilitation should be part of the punishment, whether that be a few months in jail or more in a drug rehab program. I would suggest a 3 to 5 year sentence, with the option of reduced time for good behavior. Yes, it is fair to say that a killing would get a lesser sentence. That's a pretty bad thing.
1232	First, drugs should be illegal so that a punishment can be applied. Under the use of drugs, a crime is likely to occur, and previous criminal records should be taken into consideration. To deal with the issue, I would suggest a 3 to 5 year prison sentence, with the possibility of a shorter one for good behavior. Yes, this is correct – a killing should receive less time than a drug-related offense. That's really unfortunate.
1233	A punishment for the use of drugs should include a jail term and a drug rehabilitation program. I would suggest a sentence of 3 to 5 years, with the possibility of a reduced sentence for good behavior. This is in contrast to a killing, which usually carries a lesser sentence. This does not seem fair, but it is an unfortunate reality.
1234	First, drugs are illegal, resulting in a punishment for the accused. If drugs are involved in a crime, the use of drugs should be taken into account when considering the person's prior record. Then, a suitable combination of jail time and drug rehabilitation should be decided upon, with the recommendation of a 3 to 5 year sentence and time off for good behavior. This is fair and reasonable, given the nature of the crime. Yes, a killing should still be punished more severely than a drug offense, which is understandable.
1235	It depends on the situation. I lost a friend a year ago to drug use, which is very sad. Drug use in general is a psychological issue, as there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self-medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. For example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, which is a form of peer pressure; nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a sissy, right? Therefore, society dictates that we need to “cover up” our weaknesses.   The problem with drug use is that you are simply covering one problem with another. Therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsion to use drugs. Therefore, I do believe in treatment, but I also believe that one must help themselves. For repeat offenders, I offer no sympathy.
1236	Drug use is often a psychological response to difficult life circumstances. Studies suggest that people who use drugs may be self-medicating for underlying mental illnesses such as anxiety and panic disorders. For example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of these two disorders.  Therefore, treating the underlying cause, rather than the drug use itself, may be the most effective way to address the issue. Additionally, the individual must be willing to seek help in order to effectively treat the problem. For repeat offenders, however, no sympathy should be offered.
1237	Drug use can be a complex psychological issue, and there are studies that suggest people who use drugs may be self-medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. For example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. Thus, it could be argued that drug use is an attempt to cope with difficult feelings and emotions. In this respect, drug use is akin to any other addiction – an attempt to numb difficult feelings and not face reality.  This said, society's response to drug use should not be a dismissal and ridicule, but rather a show of compassion and understanding. No one wants to hear about a grown man "acting like a sissy", and yet society often responds with ridicule and contempt rather than empathy and understanding. This is not helpful and only adds to the stigma surrounding drug use.  The biggest problem with drug use is that it is often a symptom of other issues that require addressing. Therapists must spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsion to use drugs. For repeat offenders, no amount of sympathy should be offered, as the problems associated with drug use will not be solved overnight. However, treatment should still be offered if the individual is willing to accept help.
1238	It depends on the situation. I lost a friend a year ago to drug use, and it was very sad. Drug use in general is a psychological thing, and there are studies that suggest people who use drugs are self-medicating for some other diagnosable mental illness. For example, many alcoholics are found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders. This is a good example of peer pressure - nobody wants to hear about a grown man acting like a "sissy". Society tells us, "Hell no, let's go out and drink." The problem with drug use is that you are covering one problem with another - therapists will have to spend many years dealing with the drug problem before they can even begin to address what caused the compulsion to use drugs. For repeat offenders, I offer no sympathy. I believe in treatment and helping yourself, but only if you are willing to accept help.
1239	Drug use can have various origins and psychological causes, such as a way of self-medicating for a mental illness. For example, many alcoholics are also found to have symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders, which could be a way of coping with underlying issues. Peer pressure is a factor too, as society may pressure individuals into thinking they need to be a certain way. Treatment is available, but only when the individual is willing to accept help and make the necessary changes. For repeat offenders, I have no sympathy.
1240	Filing an accident report is important to document any injuries sustained during work hours, especially if you believe your employer might try to pin the blame on you for a minor cut. Not doing so could result in your employer arguing that you were responsible for the injury at home, since you didn't report it at work. Additionally, if you told anyone about the pain in your back before you left work, your employer could use that as evidence that the injury was not sustained during work hours. You should always consult a lawyer in this situation to ensure that your rights are properly represented, as they could advise you on the best course of action. Furthermore, if you do hire a lawyer, be prepared for a lengthy and powerful legal battle, as often times, plaintiffs do not prevail. This incident should be seen as a learning experience, and you should ensure that similar incidents are avoided in the future by reporting any injuries and keeping your employer informed of any physical discomfort.
1241	If you did not fill out an accident report and your work discovers that you injured yourself at home, your work may argue that you were injured during working hours and you have no proof to dispute this. Without a proper accident report, you have no case and may end up losing your job.  Did you tell anyone about your back pain before leaving work? If you did, your work may seek to prove that you hurt yourself while on the job and put their job in jeopardy. Additionally, if you tell a lawyer, they may ask you to sign an affidavit stating that you were injured on the job, which could lead to your supervisor or even your workplace losing their job.   If you choose to hire a lawyer, be prepared to fight a long and powerful legal battle. The odds are not in your favor, as statistics show that in similar cases, you will most likely lose. It is better to visit a chiropractor to treat your injury and keep your job, rather than risking everything by filing a lawsuit.
1242	It is wise to report any injuries, even minor ones, to your supervisor. If you do not, you will have no case and may lose your job. If you want to hire a lawyer, be prepared for a long and powerful legal battle. Most of the time, you will end up losing. It is better to visit a chiropractor and keep your job, and use this as a lesson to tell someone the next time the cost of a couple hundred dollars is worth more than losing your job and potentially getting blacklisted from future employment opportunities. Your former employer can blacklist you and tell prospective employers what happened, so be careful what you say.
1243	It is advisable to report any accident, even a minor one, to your supervisor and fill out an accident report. Failure to do so may result in problems if you file a lawsuit against your employer later. Additionally, you should inform your supervisor before leaving work if your back is hurting as this could affect your claim. If you have already done this and your supervisor did not sign an affidavit stating that you told them of the pain before you left, then you may have a difficult time proving your case. Furthermore, if you choose to hire a lawyer, be prepared to invest a significant amount of time and money into the case, as there is no guarantee of winning. In the end, it is up to you to weigh the risk of going to court versus the cost of simply visiting a chiropractor and keeping your job.
1244	It is advisable to report any injuries, even minor ones, to your supervisor. If you do not, you will have a harder time proving that the injury occurred at work. Additionally, if you tell someone that your back was hurting before you left work, they may have to sign an affidavit stating that you said you hurt yourself at work, which could put their job in jeopardy. Furthermore, if you hire a lawyer, you should be prepared to fight a long and powerful legal battle, as in many cases, the injured party loses. In short, it is not worth it to risk losing your job and possibly being permanently blacklisted from the job market for a few hundred dollars. Thus, it is better to go to the chiropractor and keep your job, while learning from this experience.
1245	Dear Friend,  I am not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of systematically suspecting certain minorities of being inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I am quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, simply sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, François
1246	Dear Friend,  I understand your point, however, I believe that there is a major difference between racial profiling and insurance companies charging certain customers more for the sole reason of their race. Racial profiling consists of systematically suspecting certain minority groups of being inherently criminal, which is clearly unjustified and can result in serious repercussions for those groups. Insurance companies, on the other hand, are in the business of assessing risks and setting prices accordingly, based on data and statistics - not on race. Furthermore, customers can always choose to buy insurance from other companies that may charge different prices, based on their own data and statistics.  Therefore, I don’t believe that insurance companies should be subject to the same type of lawsuits as law enforcement personnel who carry and use guns, handcuffs and have the capacity to ruin people’s lives.
1247	Dear Friend,  I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question. Racial profiling consists of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal. If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.  But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority. Insurance companies, on the other hand, merely sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies. Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.  Your Friend, Francesois

1250	We've all heard the saying "don't believe everything you see on the internet", which assumes that information gathered from other sources not online have a natural higher level of credibility. They assume that information found in books or news channels or newspaper are more truthful. I disagree. I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should definitely look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, but I don't believe in that idea.

1255	I believe that black people in modern society have the same rights as everyone else. Statistics about educational attainment and poverty rates may exist, but they will not change my opinion. It is likely that past discrimination has had an effect on these statistics, or that the individuals in question have not been successfully integrated into society. For the purposes of this discussion, I do not consider these statistics to be relevant. It is important to remember that discrimination against any group is unacceptable, and that equal opportunity should be provided to all.
1256	I believe that black people are afforded the same rights as everyone else in the state. Even though their education rates may be lower and poverty rates higher, this is likely the result of past discrimination or their own lack of integration into society. I do not want to see any statistics about poverty, educational levels, criminal levels, how many live in ghettos, or their representation in higher-level positions in the state. I only want facts about discrimination against them.
1257	I believe that black people in modern society have the same rights as everyone else. Any differences in educational attainment, poverty rates, criminal rates, and rates of being in the higher echelons of the state hierarchy cannot be attributed to discrimination, as I am aware, but instead to individual choice and behavior. I do not want to see any statistics about these issues, as it will not change my opinion. Facts about discrimination against black people are not enough to sway my opinion; I need actual examples of discrimination and active measures being taken to make sure that black people are not being treated unfairly.
1258	I think black people have their rights protected by the state. I am aware that their education rates may be lower and their poverty rates may be higher, but this does not reflect on their basic human rights. Discrimination in the past and present may have caused this, or it may just be a result of them not being successfully integrated into society. However, I do not want to see any statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, or how many of them are living in ghettos. I want facts about actual discrimination against them.
1259	I think black people have their rights protected. The state gives them the same rights as others. And don't give me examples. It won't change my view. I am aware that their education and poverty rates may be lower, due to past discrimination or their own individual choices. That doesn't matter to me. I don't want to see statistics about poverty, education levels, criminal levels, how many of them are living in ghettos, or what percentage of them are in the higher positions of the state hierarchy. I want facts about how they are actually discriminated against.
1260	I am aware that there is no such thing as a completely unbiased news agency, but I believe that Fox News is especially biased in their reporting. It may be because they are biased in a way that contradicts my personal views, but I still view them as a poor example of news broadcasting. Am I right in believing that Fox News is the epitome of poor reporting, or am I wrongly being biased against them (making me no better than them)?   Because of this, I feel like I am actually closing my mind to a lot of good, right-supported ideas. Fox News has single-handedly closed me off from hearing out conservative ideology, which I do not like.
1261	I am aware that there is no such thing as a perfect news agency, but I believe that Fox News is exceptionally biased in their reporting.

1265	Given my understanding of American history, I can confidently assert that most people who make such a judgment typically do so without a thorough knowledge of the subject. Moreover, it is too soon to make a definitive assessment of a leader's performance when they have not yet completed their term. People often fail to objectively evaluate the past and instead judge it solely through the lens of their own generation. I may not be a fan of President Obama, but I do know that there have been far worse leaders than him.
1266	I can confidently assert that most people who say this lack a comprehensive knowledge of American history. Additionally, it is unfair to judge a leader after only a few years in office when there have been many worse presidents in the past. People tend to view history through the lens of their own time, which is not an accurate or fair assessment. I'm not a fan of Obama, but I can guarantee there have been many more ineffective presidents than him.
1267	It is wise to be cautious when evaluating any leader, particularly when it is based on a limited knowledge of history. It is impossible to accurately judge a leader who has not yet completed their term, but it is certain that many people have been worse than President Obama. This is especially true when considering the historical context of each generation. I am not a fan of President Obama, but I can assure you that we have had many worse leaders than him.
1268	It is incorrect to suggest that most people who criticize President Obama lack historical knowledge. Moreover, it is unfair to judge a leader after only two terms in office. We must look at history objectively and recognize that President Obama is not among the 5-10 worst leaders in American history.
1269	I can confidently assert that most people who make such statements do so without a deep understanding of American history. It is impossible to make such a definitive judgment on a leader who has not even completed their term yet. People tend to judge history through the lens of their own generation, instead of objectively assessing it. I may not be a fan of Obama, but there have been at least five to ten presidents who were significantly worse than him.
1270	Violence is caused by our society and its many influences. Advertising reminds us of all the things we don't have, making us feel inadequate and insecure. The news fuels mistrust among people and distances us from each other. This mistrust causes us to treat each other as objects to interact with, instead of seeing each other as people. People behave aggressively because of the pressure of modern living - telemarketers are perceived as more of an enemy due to this. We all act out because we're frustrated with our own lives and deprived of opportunities to live different ones. Our unhappiness stems from not being able to have the same things as our peers, not being able to afford them, and not being able to experience the same things as others either. We take out our anger and frustration on those around us, who become objects to interact with and not people. Less urban populations have lower rates of suicide and murder due to a lack of anonymity and more close knit communities. People are more connected and friendly, leading to a lower rate of these heinous acts.
1271	Violence is perpetuated and caused by societal structures and systems. Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and can make us feel inadequate and lacking. The news feeds us distorted views of the world and fuels mistrust between people. This mistrust causes us to treat each other not as people, but as things to interact with. People feel frustrated by the unattainable expectations that are constantly thrown at them via media, such as high pressure telemarketing, and lash out at others in anger. It’s not just video games, it’s television programming and societal structures that cause this. There are fewer suicides in small farming communities than in large cities, and less murders, because people are more close knit and friendly to each other.
1272	Violence is perpetuated and caused by society. Advertising reminds us of all the things we do not have and makes us feel inadequate and inferior. The news fuels distrust between people and causes us to view each other as things to be interacted with, rather than as human beings. This distrust causes us to treat each other badly, not as people but as objects. People are aggressive towards salespeople because of the high pressure of modern life and the need to make a living. This sense of inequality and frustration is exacerbated by media portrayals of friends, lifestyles and opportunities that we will never have. This leads to an increase in feelings of unhappiness, depression, frustration and anger. These feelings can then lead to aggression, violence and even suicide.
1273	Violence is largely caused by a lack of connection, compassion and understanding within society. Advertising reminds us of all the things we don’t have and can’t afford, making us feel inadequate and insecure. The news reports on events that create mistrust and suspicion among people. We see each other not as individuals but as things to interact with, as we become more disconnected from one another. People are treated poorly because of this, from telemarketers who are seen as a source of stress and irritation to the general public, to salesmen who are scorned for trying to make a living. This causes us to respond with anger, lashing out in frustration at those we perceive as causing our problems. It’s not video games, it’s television programming and the way it creates a disconnect between us that is the root cause of this type of violence. This is magnified in larger cities, where more people are more disconnected from each other. There are fewer suicides and murders in rural areas where people are more connected to each other and community-oriented. In these settings, there is more empathy and support and a stronger sense of community, meaning people are more likely to help and reach out to those in need.
1274	Violence is caused by a complex mix of societal and individual factors. Advertising preys on our insecurities and often serves to create unattainable and unrealistic standards of perfection. The news coverage of world events can often create mistrust and suspicion between people. This, in turn, leads to treating each other as objects to interact with, rather than as human beings. We are aggressive towards salespeople because they represent the pressures of modern life – high unemployment, financial worry, and the need to constantly be 'selling' oneself – that we feel powerless to challenge. These external factors are what lead to the feeling of being upset with our own lives, which in turn leads to more violence and aggression. Those living in small, tight-knit communities are far less likely to commit crime or take part in violent behaviour because of the strong bonds of trust and understanding that exist between them. This serves as a reminder of the power of community and social interaction in mitigating violence.
1275	"Finally, more people have died at the hands of secular governments than any form of religious 'war' in history." The raw number of people killed is not a fair measure of "badness." The population is always increasing, therefore religious wars that killed half of a certain group of people a thousand years ago might not reach the same *number* of people killed in a modern day war, even though the devastation wrought by the religious war was far worse than that of the modern war. A better measure would be some sort of "misery index." It would take into account the chances of a person born at a certain time and place either dying or living a miserable life. Certainly religion has a long record of causing misery, keeping people poor, and killing large percentages of unbelievers.

1285	I really enjoy this restaurant! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll definitely be back. I always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs, as well as the brisket which is also good. The steamed egg is great when cooled down.   I wish this place had gyoza or other appetizers, but overall it's a great choice. If my friends have room in their stomachs, we often end up going to Rolled Ice Cream afterwards!

1290	After a year, I have been consistently delighted by the quality of food and the excellent service at The Zen. Since my last review, I have tried many different dishes, and all of them have been my favorites compared to any other restaurants.   Every time I go there, I am greeted warmly by the courteous staff and they always remember me. I have had great conversations with Steven (hope that's the correct spelling), urging him to open a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often.  Some of the dishes I would highly recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice, and the Goat Curry. There are many other delicious selections as well.   If you are looking for something different or just looking for a new spot to eat, I highly recommend The Zen.

Every time I go there, I am always greeted with courteous employees and they remember me every time. I have had pleasant conversations with Steven (hope that's the correct spelling), inviting him to consider opening a store in Peterborough so I can enjoy the food more often.  Some of the dishes I would recommend are the Chicken Pakora, any of the Pad Thai, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice, and the Goat Curry. There are so many other delectable selections though.  If you're looking for something different or just searching for a new spot to eat, I highly recommend The Zen.

1295	I believe that school uniforms can restrict a student's ability to express themselves and their individuality, so allowing students to choose whether or not to wear a school uniform is the way to go.
1296	I think it is beneficial to wear school uniform as it helps to foster a sense of unity and community, while limiting distractions in the classroom. While it may restrict individual expression, the uniform policy does provide students with an equal platform to learn and grow. Therefore,
1297	I think school uniforms are a good idea because they help students look and feel united, as well as encouraging a sense of belonging to a particular school. However, I also believe that students should be able to express themselves through what they wear, and so I support the idea of
1298	I think school uniforms are a positive thing because they promote a sense of unity, equality, and respect among students. It also eliminates socio-economic differences among students, allowing them to focus more on their educational goals rather than their wardrobes. Although some may
1299	I think school uniforms are an effective way to create a sense of unity and school identity, but students should also be able to express themselves by wearing personal items of clothing, such as jewelry or a hat. Therefore, I believe school uniforms should be optional.
1300	Books are better than TV for a number of reasons. Firstly, books are much cheaper; you can buy a book without spending a lot of money. Secondly, books can help you learn, as they provide valuable knowledge and information. Thirdly, while there is some great content on TV, there is also a lot of violence and inappropriate content which is not suitable for children. In comparison, books are safer and more appropriate for children. Therefore, books are definitely better than TV.
1301	Books are better than TV because they are more cost-effective. If you want to buy a TV, it would be expensive and you would have to purchase a TV license. Books can help you learn and there is less concern about the content being either violent or not appropriate for children. Thus, books are much better than TV.
1302	Books are better than TV in many ways. For one, books are cheaper; you don't have to spend a lot of money to buy a book. Additionally, books do not require a license to watch, like TV does. Lastly, books provide learning opportunities that can benefit viewers of all ages. In contrast, much of the content on TV is either violent or inappropriate for children, making it unsuitable viewing material. Therefore, books are definitely the better choice!
1303	Books are better than TV because they are more economical. If you wanted to buy a TV, it would be quite expensive, and you would have to purchase a license as well. Books can help you learn a lot of things, and there is less likelihood of exposing your children to inappropriate content. In short, books are definitely the better option.
1304	Books are better than TV for a variety of reasons. Firstly, books are much cheaper than buying a TV. You also do not have to purchase a TV license in order to watch a book. Books can also help people learn and grow, as they provide valuable information and insights. Furthermore, much of the content on TV can be violent or inappropriate for children, so books are a much safer and more sensible option. Therefore, books are well better than TV.
1305	India is currently facing many challenges that make it difficult to lead the world.  1. Nearly 90% of the population is illiterate, which hinders India's ability to develop and compete on a global level.  2. India is highly divided along caste, religious, and political lines, creating further inefficiency and stagnation.  3. India does not have self-confidence and continues to criticize itself, which is an obstacle to progress.  Therefore, it is unlikely that India will be able to lead the world anytime soon.
1306	India is still struggling to manage itself first, so it is unlikely that it will be leading the world anytime soon. Considering the fact that almost 90% of India is illiterate, it is clear that an illiterate country cannot lead the world. Moreover, India is too focused on caste systems, politics, and religious differences that hamper its development. Finally, India does not have faith in itself and is still trying to overcome its own internal issues, making it difficult to believe that it can lead the world. Thus, it is unlikely that India will lead the world anytime soon.
1307	India is facing its own challenges in managing itself, so it is unfeasible to expect India to lead the world at this time. However, if India is able to overcome its illiteracy rate, reduce caste and religious divides, and have more faith in itself, then it may have a chance to lead the world in the future. India’s current lack of confidence and political turmoil make it impossible for India to lead the world at this time.
1308	India is still dealing with the challenges of poverty, illiteracy, castes, and religious divides, among other issues. With such deeply rooted problems, it will be difficult for India to take on the role of a world leader in the near future. As an illiterate country, India cannot lead the world. Additionally, India's lack of self-confidence and internal divisions make it clear that it is not yet ready to take on such an important role. For India to become a leader on the global stage, it must first focus on resolving its internal issues, which will take time and effort. Until then, India will remain a follower, not a leader.
1309	Well, India is still struggling to manage itself first... so it is highly unlikely that India will be leading the world anytime soon.   Firstly, almost 90% of India is illiterate, which renders an illiterate country unable to lead the world.   Secondly, India is more focused on caste systems, politics, and religious divides, and less focused on development.  Thirdly, India still lacks confidence in itself and is still trying to overcome past issues, making it highly improbable that India will be leading the world anytime soon.
1310	In the past, children were able to walk around freely and safely to and from places such as the candy store and school. Unfortunately, this has opened the door to new criminal activities such as child pornography and sexual predation online. Pornography has brought about new dangers and crimes that were not present before.
1311	In the past, children were able to roam freely around their neighborhood, to and from the local candy store, and to and from school. However, with the rise of child pornography, sexual predators online, and the increasing availability of hardcore porn, the doors have been opened to a new wave of crime.  This suggests that we need to adopt stricter laws and protective measures to ensure the safety of our children.
1312	In the past, children had more autonomy and were able to move about freely. Unfortunately, this has resulted in the proliferation of child pornographers, sexual predators online, and the spread of pornography in general, which has opened the doors to new forms of crime.
1313	In the past, children had more freedom and were able to explore their environment, including nearby stores and places of learning. Unfortunately, this has led to an increase in child pornographers, sexual predators and other criminals taking advantage of the situation online. Pornography has made it easier for these predators to find and victimize children.
1314	In the past, children were able to go about their business without any fear of being harmed. Unfortunately, this has changed due to the emergence of child pornographers and sexual predators who prey on children online. Pornography has created an environment that has enabled new and dangerous crimes to flourish.
1315	I apologize for my earlier statement - I should have said "creationist version of evolution".
1316	I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.
1317	I apologize for using the term "creationist version of evolution". I should have said "intelligent design" version of evolution. My mistake.
1318	Oops, I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.
1319	I regret my use of the term "creationist version of evolution". I should have said "intelligent design" instead. My apologies.
1320	I can argue that humans have not evolved since the dawn of recorded history.
1321	I can demonstrate to you that humans have not evolved since the dawn of written history.
1322	I can demonstrate to you that humans have not evolved since the dawn of history, as it is recorded.
1323	I can provide evidence to show that human evolution has remained relatively stable over the course of history.
1324	I can demonstrate to you that humans have not evolved since the start of written history.
1325	That does not make much sense. Why are we still evolving but the monkeys are not?  Why are fish not jumping out of the water and growing legs? I mean, if it happened billions of years ago, then how come it is not happening today? Why can we not find pseudo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for an unknown period of time?
1326	It does not make sense why we are still evolving but monkeys are not. Why are fish not jumping out of the water and growing legs? If it happened billions of years ago, then why is it not happening today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time period of thousands of years?
1327	That does not make sense. Why are we still evolving while the monkeys are not? Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? I mean, if it happened billions of years ago, then why isn't it happening today? Why haven't we found psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused the evolutionary process to stop for a mysterious time of thousands of years?
1328	That does not make sense. Why are we still evolving while the monkeys are not? Why are fish not jumping out of the water and growing legs? I mean, if it happened billions of years ago, then how come it is not occurring today? Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for an unknown period of time?
1329	That does not seem logical. Why are we still evolving, while the monkeys are not? Why are fish not jumping out of the water and growing legs? I cannot fathom why this occurred billions of years ago, but it is not happening today. Why can we not find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious period of time?
1330	Everyone has their own desires, and sure women may be adversely affected by pornography, but it's their choice to pursue that career path. If they want to be in that industry, it is their right to make that decision.
1331	Everyone has their own wishes and preferences, and yes, women can be disrespected by pornography. But it is their choice to pursue that career path. If they want to be in that industry, it is their decision.
1332	People have their own personal preferences and desires, and pornography can be degrading to women. However, it is their own free choice to pursue that career path. If they want to be part of that industry, it is their prerogative.
1333	Everyone has different desires, and sure, women may be marginalized by pornography, but it is their free choice to pursue that career. If they want to be part of that industry, that is their right.
1334	Everyone has their own desires, and yes, women can be negatively affected by pornography. But it is their choice to pursue a career in that industry if they want to. If they feel that is the path they want to take, it is their right to make that choice.
1335	Some people claim that God is against pornography, but we won't be able to know for sure as the Bible does not explicitly condemn it due to the fact that it did not exist during biblical times. Therefore, how can we be sure that it is a sin?
1336	Some people argue that God is against pornography because it is not mentioned in the Bible. However, this is an inaccurate assessment, as the Bible does not have to explicitly address every issue or behavior in order for it to be considered a sin. Moreover, what may not have been prohibited in the past could still be considered a sin, as the Bible provides a framework for right and wrong conduct. As such, it is still possible to understand that por
1337	Some people argue that God is against pornography because the Bible does not explicitly refer to it. However, we cannot know for certain that it is a sin if it did not exist during biblical times. How can we be sure it is prohibited if the Bible does not explicitly mention it?
1338	Some people argue that God is against pornography because it is forbidden in the Bible, however this could be disqualified since the Bible did not outrightly condemn it as it did not exist during Biblical times. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that it is a sin.
1339	Some people assert that God is against pornography. However, since the Bible was written at a time when pornography did not exist, it does not directly address the issue of pornography as a sin. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively say that it is a sin.
1340	Cooperation is better than competition because, as the Bible says, "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor." For example, football is a team sport, with everyone working together and believing in each other, rather than focusing only on themselves. On the night of the Super Bowl, the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive with only two minutes left, relying instead on the lineman blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. We all need each other and depend on each other to be successful.
1341	Promoting the common good is more beneficial because, as the Bible says, "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor." For example, football is a team sport in which players must believe in each other and not themselves. No one individual can succeed without the other; the linemen blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the linemen, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. We all need each other and depend on each other to achieve greatness.
1342	Working together for the common good is preferable because the Bible says, “Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.” For example, football is a team sport, in which all the players must rely on each other and put aside individual goals for the good of the team. During the Super Bowl, the Steelers could not score the winning drive in the last two minutes without the linemen blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the linemen, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. We need each other, and mutual dependence and respect, to become great.
1343	Working together is more effective than individual effort because, as the Bible states, “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor” (Ecclesiastes 4:9). For example, football is a team sport in which everyone has to believe in each other and not themselves. There is no “I” in the team, as was shown when the Pittsburgh Steelers couldn’t score the winning drive during the Super Bowl with only two minutes left, with the linemen blocking for the quarterback, the quarterback believing in the linemen and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. We need each other and depend on each other to be great.
1344	Unity and collaboration are more effective than individual effort because, as the Bible says, "two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor" (Ecclesiastes 4:9). This is especially true in sports, such as football, where teamwork and collective belief are necessary to achieve success. During the Super Bowl, the Pittsburgh Steelers' failure to score the winning drive in the last two minutes illustrates the importance of mutual support and trust. The linemen must block for the quarterback, the quarterback must believe in the linemen and have faith in his receivers in order to make a good pass. In this way, the team is greater than the individuals, and all together they can achieve greatness.
1345	1. Uniforms can make everyone feel equal by eliminating socio-economic disparities in clothing choices. Without uniforms, children from lower-income backgrounds may be teased for wearing clothes that are considered "inferior".  2. Uniforms also save time and energy because students do not need to worry about choosing an outfit in the morning. This can save time and reduce stress for both students and parents. Furthermore, this time can be used for more productive activities, such as studying or extracurricular activities.
1346	1. Uniforms make everyone equal - if children wearing whatever they want could lead to some children being teased and feeling less equal to their peers compared to those with uniforms.  2. Moreover, not having to worry about what to wear in the morning can save students valuable time that could be better spent on learning. When students are required to wear uniforms, they can simply throw on their uniform without having to worry about what to wear and can devote more time and energy to their studies.
1347	1. Uniforms can create a sense of equality among students, as they all wear the same articles of clothing. This can prevent children from being teased for their clothing choices and make them feel more equal to their peers.  2. Uniforms can also help reduce the amount of time students spend getting ready in the morning, as they do not need to find or match pieces of clothing. This can help free up more time for learning in the classroom.
1348	1. Uniforms can make everyone feel equal, as children are not teased as much for their clothing choices when there is a uniform policy in place. Additionally, uniforms may help promote unity amongst students and staff and can foster a sense of belonging.  2. Uniforms can save time, as students will not need to spend hours each day finding the right pair of pants or shirt. Furthermore, uniforms can reduce social distraction within the school, as students' attention can be better focused on learning.
1349	1. Uniforms can help to create a sense of equality among students. However, some children may be teased if they cannot afford to wear the same clothes as their peers.   2. Uniforms also help to focus students’ attention on learning rather than how they look or what they are wearing. Some students may spend up to an hour getting ready in the morning and that hour could be better spent studying.
1350	Wearing school uniform can be a source of stress for students, as they need to make sure they are following the guidelines and looking their best. However, when students wear mufti, they don't have to worry about what they are wearing and can focus more on their academic performance. It also makes socializing with peers easier, as
1351	Wearing school uniforms can be awkward, but with school jumpers, you don't have to worry about what you have to wear! You can be comfortable and stylish at the same time.
1352	It eliminates stress over what to wear! When others are wearing school uniform and you get to wear what you want...
1353	By wearing school uniforms, you can avoid the awkwardness of having to decide what to wear in the morning! Not wearing a school uniform has its drawbacks, as people might judge you for not abiding by the school's dress code.
1354	You don't have to worry about what you have to wear! Wearing school uniforms can be awkward, but when you wear mufti...
1355	I enjoy watching TV because it provides an opportunity to view pornography with family members without feeling guilty.

1360	India has always been powerful, and it is important to recognize and celebrate its ancient glory and history.
1361	Indians have always been powerful and proud of its ancient glory and history.
1362	Indians have always been powerful, and you are forgetting about its ancient glory and history.
1363	India has always been powerful, and it's important to remember its glorious history.
1364	India has always been powerful, why have we forgotten about its ancient glory and history?
1365	Yes, as punishment, they should learn that if they do something wrong, they will be met with some form of consequence.
1366	Yes, since corporal punishment is effective in instilling fear of consequences in the child's mind, and they are more likely to remember the lesson learned.
1367	Yes, to ensure they remember the consequences of their actions and to help them learn in a way that is meaningful and memorable.
1368	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that reinforces the lesson that if they do something wrong, they will have consequences.
1369	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that has them understanding the consequences of their actions. If they misbehave, they should be disciplined in order to help them understand the repercussions of their actions.
1370	Christianity aims to foster better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the teachings of Christ, what harm is there? Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any human. For an ideology to be superior to any human being, it must really annoy those who fall short of it.
1371	Christianity seeks to foster better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the teachings of Christ is much better than any other human being. Such a belief system must really anger those individuals who fall well short of it.
1372	Atheism does not necessarily promote bad morals or ethics. But Christianity does offer a set of guidelines and values to strive for, which can lead to a more ethical life. Moreover, Christianity is based on the teachings of a specific individual, Jesus Christ, which atheism is not. To believe that one should follow the teachings of Christ is a personal decision and may be a better example to follow than any other. In addition, atheism as an ideology cannot be 'better' than any other, as it does not have any fixed beliefs.
1373	Christianity seeks to promote better morals and ethics, while atheism has nothing to contribute. To believe in Christ, a figure of morality, is surely better than adhering to any atheist ideology that must surely enrage those who fall far short of it.
1374	I believe Christianity works towards promoting better morals and ethics, while atheism has nothing to contribute. There is no harm in striving to live by the ways of Christ, especially when compared to the alternative. It is true that any ideology should be held to a higher standard than any human being, and atheism clearly falls short of this standard. This reality must surely frustrate those who fail to live up to it.

1376	It is unacceptable to hit a child. Discipline should be handled in a responsible and thoughtful way.  No child should get hit. There are various forms of discipline
1377	No child should ever be physically disciplined. There are other forms of discipline that can be used instead.
1378	No child should ever be physically disciplined. There are other forms of discipline that can be used as alternatives to physical punishment.
1379	It is never acceptable to hit a child. Different forms of disciplinary actions can be taken, depending on the situation.
1380	A worthy topic for a constitutional amendment could be to change the requirements to be president. Rather than requiring natural-born citizenship, it could stipulate that the individual must have been a citizen of the United States for 40 years. This would ensure that individuals who have moved to the United States as children, and thus know the country as well as any other youth, are eligible for the highest office in the land. Additionally, examples could be provided to illustrate the potential effects of this amendment.
1381	A good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements to be president. Instead of having to be a natural-born citizen, it could be changed to require that the individual be a United States citizen for 40 years. This would allow people whose parents move to the US when they are children, for example, to run for president. This would be a good topic to discuss in the paper and could be elaborated on with examples. Remember to explain yourself and put your heart and soul into it to get a good grade.
1382	A sensible proposal for an amendment to the Constitution could involve changing the requirements to be president. Instead of having to be a "natural born citizen" as it stands now, the amendment could state that one must be a United States citizen for 40 years. This would ensure that those who move to the US as children and grow up here would be treated equally as any other person who has lived in the US for the same amount of time. Additionally, this would provide examples of why this is necessary and explain how this amendment would benefit others. Lastly, one should put their thoughts and feelings into the paper in order to get a good grade.
1383	A proposal for an amendment to the Constitution could involve changing the requirements for being president. The current policy states that a president must be 35 years old and a resident of the United States for 14 years, but natural-born citizenship should be replaced with United States citizenship for 40 years. This would ensure that people who move to the United States as children are afforded the same rights and opportunities as any other American.  I could further elaborate on this idea with examples and explanations to support the argument. Additionally, it is important to make sure the paper includes passion and conviction to receive a good grade.
1384	A good proposal for an amendment to the Constitution would be to change the requirements for becoming president. Instead of requiring that the candidate be a “natural born citizen” of the United States, the amendment could specify that the individual must be a citizen of the United States for 40 years. This would allow people whose parents immigrate to the US when they are children to run for president. It would also ensure that the individual knows and loves the United States in the same way as any other American citizen.
1385	If you are serious about making a difference, you may want to consider donating some of your money to a worthy cause. A young family struggling to make ends meet and who has to work every day could really use your help. The same goes for an elderly person living on a fixed income who may not be able to afford their electric bill. You could also donate to a children's hospital, animal protection society, or senior center in your area. There are many things you can do with your money, so I hope you find what you're looking for.

1390	If that person was under oath and was "giving themselves in" I'm sure that they would be taken into custody by the Court. It would be a time-consuming process, but the Court would be obligated to do so in order to serve justice. Anybody who would testify in Court and admit to a crime they didn't commit would then be charged with perjury, which is punishable by the laws of the State.  Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed since they swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. God is listening, Help Them! Think about it.
1391	Well, if that someone was under oath and was "giving themselves in" I'm sure that they would accommodate the person!  Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.  Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.  Someone who truthfully, under oath, admits to a crime would be believed as they swore they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So Help Them God.  So God if your listening, Help Them!!!

1393	If someone were under oath and "giving themselves in" I'm sure that the Court would accommodate the person by sending a Bailiff to take the person into custody, in order to ensure that justice is served. It would be a time-consuming process, of course, but it is a necessary step in the arrest and processing of someone who admits to a crime (especially murder).  Anybody who would testify falsely in Court to a crime they did not commit would then be charged with perjury, which is punishable by the State's laws.  So, God, if you are listening, Help Them! Think about it.
1394	If someone were under oath and "giving themselves in" I'm sure that the Court would ask the Bailiff to take them into custody, in order to serve justice. It would be a lengthy process, of course, as arrests are, but I guarantee that the person would be held and the paperwork would begin.  Anyone who testifies in Court and admits to a crime but didn't really commit it would then be charged with perjury, which is punishable by the State's laws.  God, if you're listening, Help Them!
1395	What?!? And all these years I've been paying income taxes! We often end up overpaying each year, and then get a partial refund in the spring to help cover any holiday credit card purchases or home improvement projects. It's always nice to get a refund, but many Americans end up having to pay more because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the year. Ouch!
1396	What?!? And all these years I've been paying. . .  No, we are absolutely required to pay income taxes! We actually OVER-pay each year, and then in the Spring we get a partial refund. That's always nice, to help cover any credit card purchases we may have made at Christmas, or to do a home improvement project. But many Americans end up having to pay in even more, because not enough has been deducted from their wages throughout the previous year. OUCH!

1400	Your chances of collecting compensation from him are not good. Your attorney may sue him, but it is unlikely you will receive a sizable amount. Even if you win the case, you will have to pursue him for garnishments and other forms of payment. If he does not own a home or other material possessions, an attorney may not bother to take the case. He may look into your personal automobile insurance, which typically covers uninsured motorists if you have that coverage. Your attorney should be able to provide an estimate of what you can expect to receive after their fee, which is typically 25-40%.
1401	Your chances of succeeding are not great, given his limits. Your attorney may choose to sue him, but it is unlikely that you would receive much. If he does not own a home or other valuable assets, an attorney may not find it worthwhile to pursue the case. He may look into your personal auto insurance, which should provide coverage for uninsured motorists if you have it. Your medical bills totaling $170,000 indicates that you do not have any personal medical insurance. Your attorney should be able to provide a more detailed estimate of your expected settlement after taking their fee (typically 25-40%).
1402	Your chances of collecting from him are not good. Your attorney may choose to pursue the case but it is unlikely that you will receive much in the way of compensation, especially if the other party does not have any assets or material possessions. If you win the case, you may have to take legal action against him to obtain garnishments or other forms of financial relief. Even if your attorney is able to win the case, you will have to pay their fee which is usually around 25-40%. You also mentioned that you have $170,000 in medical bills, which indicates that you may not have any personal medical insurance. Your attorney should be able to provide you with an estimate of what you can expect to receive after their fee.
1403	Your chances of success in suing him are not great. Your attorney may be willing to take the case, but it is unlikely that you will receive much compensation, even if you win. If he does not own a home or other material possessions, an attorney may not be willing to take the case, as they would not get much from the suit. He may look at your auto insurance, which covers uninsured motorists if you have that coverage. Your attorney should be able to tell you how much you can expect to receive after their fee, which is typically 25-40%.
1404	Your odds of collecting from him are not good, especially since he does not appear to have any material assets. Your attorney might file a lawsuit, but even if successful, it is unlikely that you will receive much in the way of damages. You may have to pursue him for garnishments and other debt collection methods, as he may not have insurance for uninsured motorists and you may not have personal medical or auto insurance either. Based on your description of your medical bills, it is likely that you do not have any insurance coverage. Your attorney should be able to explain to you what you can expect to receive after their fees, which typically range from 25-40%.
1405	You have all missed the point.  Confidential sources within the Government that leak classified information are not covered by the First Amendment.  When a court order is issued, there is more at stake than a news story.  Often the court order compromises one case to resolve another.  When you have someone that leaks vital information that threatens the welfare of the American People (nuclear secrets, etc), you might have to give up a case against a squealer to get the name of the mole.  Freedom of the press means you can publish what you want.  It doesn't mean that you are free of the consequences.  Geraldo got thrown out of Iraq for airing the American battle plans for Baghdad before the battle.  He should have been hung.

1410	Marriage is a legal agreement and the license is necessary to formalize it. It serves to protect women’s interests in terms of property and parenting, as well as provide a sense of security. It should not be taken lightly, and if benefits of marriage were eliminated, I believe it would reduce the divorce rate. People would no longer have an incentive to marry for financial or insurance gain, or for convenience. They would have to genuinely care about and commit to the other person if they want a marriage to last.
1411	Marriage is a legal and private matter. It is primarily a contract to protect the interests of women regarding property and children. It is a protective measure, and should not be taken lightly. If people no longer have the desire to marry or have children, or if they do not feel that the relationship is meaningful, there should be no reason to pursue a marriage license. Removing the financial incentive and social pressure of marriage could lead to fewer divorces. People should marry for love, companionship, and a shared vision of the future, not money, status, or other ulterior motives.
1412	Marriage is a legal contract, and the license is required to make it official. It serves to protect women’s interests, in terms of property and child-rearing. It is a protection that should not be taken lightly, as it serves an important social and economic purpose. If people no longer have the motivation to marry for reasons such as money, insurance, or otherwise, then the benefits of marriage should be taken away. This could potentially reduce the divorce rate, as people would not be able to take advantage of the institution for their own gain.
1413	Marriage is a commitment between two people, and the license makes it legal. It serves to protect women's interests both financially and in terms of raising children, which is a valuable asset in today's society. It's important to consider the potential consequences before entering into a marriage, so as to avoid any unwanted issues later down the line. If people understand the implications of what they're getting into, the divorce rate could potentially be reduced. Couples should marry for love and companionship, rather than money, insurance, or other external benefits.
1414	Marriage is a legal contract which serves to protect women's interests with regards to property, as well as for raising children. It is a form of protection, and should not be taken lightly. If people do not intend to stay together, or have children, or make a community, then there is no need for it. People should not enter into it simply for the benefits, such as financial or health insurance, as this would reduce the divorce rate.
1415	Any society that values the worth of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.  Where punishments are decided by mortals, there is a risk that the harsher sentences are handed out according to prejudice.  Where the best lawyers are available to those with the most money, there is always a risk that the poor are disadvantaged.

1417	No one should underestimate the value of human life, and any society that does so is hypocritical if it includes flogging and capital punishment in its justice system.  Humans are fallible, and with this system there is always the risk that innocent people may be wrongly flogged or executed.  Where mortals decide punishments, there is the possibility that harsher sentences may be given out based on prejudice.  Where the best lawyers are only available to those with the most money, this puts the poor at a disadvantage.
1418	No.   Any society that values the worth of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include flogging and capital punishment in their justice system.  With a fallible justice system, there is always the risk that innocent people will be flogged or executed.

1420	Saying it with an "a" and saying it with an "er" is no difference. Think about it, Most Black people cut the "er" off of words in the first place, while white people don't. So the actual pronunciation does not take away from the degradation of the word. I have been black all my life. I have listened to my mom say it, I have listened to my dad say it, but I never really used it. (Sometimes by mistake if the people that I am with say it a lot, but I always correct myself.) I hate that word, and its use. I think people use it because they are afraid of saying something else and looking "corny". When I was in college, I suggested Not My "Ni99a" Day, and it worked.

1425	My school has a policy of gathering the entire student body and staff in a designated stadium in the event of a bomb threat. However, a clever terrorist (or whoever) could find out about this practice by looking at the website of any other school and plant a bomb in the stadium, resulting in the death of all students and staff. It would make more sense to simply run to my car (off campus) and escape, since it’s worth saving my life 100% of the time. Furthermore, our school will often notify us if there is a drill that day, so I would know if it is a legitimate threat. CMV.
1426	My school has a policy that if there is a bomb threat, everyone must gather in the stadium and wait for police and a bomb squad to arrive. However, a clever terrorist (or whoever) could easily find out about this procedure and plant a bomb in the stadium, resulting in the death of everyone present, including students and staff. It is clearly better to take the initiative and run to my car (off campus) and escape, since it is worth saving my life 100% of the time. Our school informs us if there is a drill or not, so I would know if it is a valid threat. CMV.

However, a clever terrorist (or whoever) could easily find out about this procedure and plant a bomb in the stadium, leading to the potential death of all students and staff. It would be more sensible to just run to my car (off campus) and escape, given the potential for saving my own life.

1430	When considering any changes to the structures of any of their professional leagues, a lot of arguments revolve around how parity can best be maintained or enhanced.  I don't see why anybody cares.  The most exciting moments and periods in sports happen when there's a handful of titans ducking it out, not a mediocre field where anybody can win.  Sure, Barcelona/Real Madrid/Atletico Madrid are miles ahead of most of their competition in La Liga. But tons of people who otherwise would never watch a match will tune in when they face each other.  People don't tune in to watch games between two middle-of-the-pack teams nearly as much as they do for games between the top two teams in probably any sport.  True parity, if achieved, would mean that every team is a middle-of-the-pack team.  Why should I prefer that than having a handful of teams that are truly great and exciting to watch?

1435	Based on the assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, if we were able to create another being capable of being a sentient life form, it would not be equal to us, regardless of its increased intelligence. This being would have to achieve the same things as us, including creating more sentient lifeforms, at the same rate we did or else it would be greater than us, and if slower than us, it would still be inferior. However, this would only be the case if our creator, God, was capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be our equal.
1436	Based on the assumption that humans are artificial and not part of nature, we could potentially create another being that is sentient and capable of having a life of its own. This being would not be equal to us, however, until it has achieved the same things as us, including the capacity to create more sentient life forms. If it does achieve these things faster than us, then it would be greater than us. Conversely, if it achieves them slower, then it would be inferior to us. However, this is only the case if we are able to create another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator, and not just ourselves. Otherwise, it would never be our equal.

1440	Trapper John was a quitters who took advantage of the situation while it was convenient for him. Meanwhile, BJ was dedicated to his colleagues and stayed until the end with Hawkeye, who was slowly losing his grip on reality. However, rather than reach out to check on them, Trapper chose to leave early. BJ, on the other hand, was filming home videos of his family to bring some joy to his comrades and taking over Hawkeye’s surgeries whenever he needed a break.
1441	While Trapper John was leaving the war zone while the going was good, BJ was staying with Hawkeye until the end. Even as the war dragged on and Hawkeye was starting to lose his grip, Trapper didn't bother to check in or care? No, but BJ delighted everyone with home videos of his family, pulled pranks on Charles, and took over surgery whenever Hawkeye started seeing chickens on buses.
1442	Trapper was a coward, a fool who took advantage of the situation when it was beneficial for him. Meanwhile, BJ was steadfastly by Hawkeye's side until the very end. As the war dragged on, and Hawkeye started to lose his grip on reality, did Trapper bother to reach out and check on them? No, but BJ was constantly trying to make Hawkeye laugh with home movies of Peg and Erin, playing pranks on Charles, and seamlessly taking over surgery.
1443	Trapper was a phony, a goofball who got out just in time. While he was back in the States establishing his private practice (Trapper John, MD), BJ was with Hawkeye until the very end. As the war dragged on and Hawk was starting to lose it, did Trapper call to check in and make sure they were doing alright? No, but BJ was pleasing his comrades with home films of Peg and Erin, pranking Charles, and stepping up to take over surgery during Hawkeye's hallucinatory episodes.
1444	While Trapper John was enjoying the comforts of civilian life, his friend BJ was right by Hawkeye's side until the end of the war. Despite Trapper's absence, BJ still found time to make home movies of his family, prank his colleagues, and take over surgery while Hawkeye was hallucinating chickens.

I could bicker about the member who posted the debate on being illiterate...and rant on about how ridiculous it is to make such a remark...after all, how could posters be illiterate, if they read and write? The person who created the debate obviously doesn't get it, even if it is just an attempt at being sarcastic...but what's the point?

Both parties have proposed solutions, but none have been able to reach an agreement. The debate has largely focused on the cost of healthcare, the availability of healthcare services, and the quality of care. These are all important factors, but it’s time to take a broader, long-term view of the healthcare system. We need to consider how the system

1448	It is inefficient to spend too much time and energy on trivial matters such as misspellings. We all make mistakes sometimes, but it is unnecessary to draw attention to them. It is also unwise to mock illiteracy, especially when it is difficult to tell if the author is being sarcastic or not. It does not benefit anyone to focus on such things, and it would be better to use that time and effort to focus on more important matters.

1450	Jon Stewart has a more sophisticated comedy style and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has on are great as well. He gets bonus points for being first to do this type of news satire. Stephen Colbert, on the other hand, relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.

1453	Jon Stewart has a more sophisticated humour style and tends to cover more important issues in a more effective way. His interviews are always engaging and the special guests he has are usually great. He earns bonus points for being the original pioneer in the field.  Stephen, on the other hand, relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as funny as Stewart.
1454	Jon Stewart has a much more sophisticated humour style, and tends to cover more important issues. He always has great interviews and the special reporters he has are great too. He also gets bonus points for being there first.  Stephen relies too much on gimmicky things and has a less sophisticated comedy style. The whole arrogant act he puts on can be irritating and he's generally not as genuinely funny as Stewart.
1455	I recommend Jardin Panos. It's a typical Greek restaurant with a Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth style. If you're looking for a rustic chicken and filet mignon brochette with salad and rice, accompanied by tzaziki, you'll be pleased to find that the food is consistently decent. The outdoor Terrasse is adorable, making it a great summer destination for many locals.
1456	Personally, I really enjoy Jardin Panos. It is a typical Greek restaurant with some similarities to Casa Grec and Vieux Duluth.   If you are looking for a rustic chicken and filet mignon brochette, accompanied by a regular salad and rice, as well as a tzaziki entrée, then Panos is the place for you. The restaurant offers consistently decent food, making it a reliable option. Furthermore, their outdoor Terrasse is very charming, making it a great choice for summer visitors.

If you're looking for a rustic chicken or filet mignon brochette, accompanied with a regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, Panos will deliver decent meals consistently;)   My favorite thing about this restaurant is its outdoor Terrasse. It is very charming and popular during the summer months.
1458	Personally, I really like Jardin Panos. It's nothing special. It's just your typical Greek restaurant a la Casa Grec or Vieux Duluth.   If you're looking for a rustic chicken brochette, filet mignon brochette, with the regular salad and rice, and an entrée of tzaziki, go ahead. Try it! The food is consistently decent. In a world of mystery meat, Panos will deliver average every time;)   What I like best about this restaurant is the outdoor Terrasse. It's very cute. Like for a lot of people in the area, this is more of a summer destination rather than a middle of winter spot.

1460	You can observe evolution happening in real time with fruit flies. The rapid breeding, living, and dying of these creatures allows for evolution to occur quickly. Mutations occur which cause some creatures to have better success rates than others. Over time, these successful creatures will make up the majority of the population, a process known as natural selection. Speciation occurs when species split into two different species due to changes in their environment. If you look closely, you can observe these changes and how they gradually lead to evolution.
1461	You can actually observe evolution happening. Fruit Flies are a good model organism for this experiment as they reproduce, live and die quickly. Natural selection is the process through which species adapt over time in order to survive and reproduce in their environment. Mutations are the original genetic variations that can lead to different traits and allow certain species to thrive. Over time, these changes can lead to the formation of new species. If you look closely, you can clearly see the changes that evolution brings over time.
1462	You can actually observe evolution take place. Fruit flies are a useful species for this experiment as they rapidly breed, live, and die. Evolution occurs due to mutations, which allow some creatures to survive better than others. Natural selection is the mechanism by which this occurs. Speciation is another example of evolution, where different species are formed as they adapt to slightly different environments. If you observe closely, you can clearly see evolution at work.
1463	You can observe evolution taking place in real time. Fruit flies are an ideal species for experimentation since they rapidly breed, live, and die. Evolution occurs as a result of mutations, which give certain organisms a better chance of surviving than others. This process is known as natural selection. Speciation also occurs when organisms diverge into two distinct species due to their adaptations to slightly different environments. If you watch closely, evolution is clearly visible.
1464	You can clearly observe the process of evolution through experiments with fruit flies. The creatures reproduce and die quickly, making them ideal for such studies. Evolution occurs as a result of mutations, with the more adaptive organisms becoming more common over time through natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution, as different species arise when organisms adapt to slightly different environments. If you observe closely, you can clearly witness evolution at work.
1465	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love," then anyone could marry anyone else, regardless of age or species. Marriage is a sacred bond between two people who are dedicated to a life-long partnership, so it has to involve more than just romantic feelings.
1466	Is marriage just about "love"? I think not. It's about societal norms, legal rights, families, generations, example, commitment, tax breaks, and parental roles. If it were just about "love", then two kids at the local middle school could get married, too. It's not only about love.
1467	Is marriage just about "love"? I don't think so. It's about more than that. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about setting an example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love", I could marry my pet dog, and two kids at the local middle school could also get married. It's about more than that.
1468	Is marriage just about "love"? I don't think so. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about setting a positive example. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love", then I could marry my pet dog and two kids at the local middle school could get married too. Marriage is a much bigger concept than that.

1470	If god loves everyone, then why does he hate certain groups, such as gays? Also, have you ever wondered about the possibility of translational bias when it comes to the Bible, such that certain changes could be made to make "god" appear more favourable?
1471	If God loves everyone, then why does He hate gays? Some Christians question whether the Bible is authentic, since one cardinal reportedly changed some content to make God look more favorable.
1472	If God is said to love everyone, then why does He hate gays, given that the Bible is merely a book? Have you ever wondered how the one cardinal who translated it may have changed some passages in order to make "God" look more favorable?  The cardinal's bias may have altered the meaning of certain verses and left a lasting impression of His will, even though it may not have

1475	I ensured I never repeated the misbehavior after being disciplined for it to avoid a greater punishment. The second time is always worse because you know you were told not to do it already.
1476	I made sure to avoid any further punishment by not repeating the same mistake after receiving a spanking. The second time is always worse, since you have been warned not to do it again.
1477	Having experienced the consequence of being punished after receiving a spanking, I made sure to avoid any similar misbehavior in the future to avoid being subjected to more severe punishment.
1478	After a spanking, I ensured I would never repeat the same mistake to avoid further punishment, as the second time is always worse due to the knowledge that you have already been told not to do it.
1479	I ensured that I never repeated the same mistake after I was scolded or punished for it, in order to avoid further consequences.
1480	Spanking can be an effective form of discipline in certain situations, but it should not be used out of anger and should only be used after other forms of communication have failed.
1481	Because spanking is often done out of frustration and can be for more than what the child has done, such as if someone else has made them angry, they may lash out on the child.
1482	Spanking should be used only when necessary and should not be done out of anger. It should also not be excessive and should be tailored to the child's behavior.
1483	Because spanking is often done out of anger, and can be for more than what the child has done, such as if someone else made them angry, resulting in a parent lashing out at the child.
1484	Spanking can be done out of anger and may be excessive when the child has not actually done anything wrong. For example, if someone else makes the child angry, the parent may take out their anger on the child. This type of discipline can be harmful and should be avoided.
1485	This does not make sense: you steal a candy bar from school and get punished by having something of equal value stolen. The same thing applies to this: you hit someone and get punished by being hit by the same person. You are told not to hit someone, but then it happens again with no consequence.
1486	It does not make sense: you steal a candy bar from school and are disciplined by having your favorite toy stolen. Similarly, you hit someone and are then hit by the same person. You are told not to hit someone and also not to hit, only to be hit again.
1487	Does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school, and then your parents steal your favorite toy. You have stolen something and have been disciplined by having something stolen. This is similar to what is happening here. You hit someone and are then hit back by the same person. You are told not to hit someone, but then told not to hit and then hit.
1488	Does this make sense: you take a candy bar from school and are disciplined by having it taken away? It's the same thing when you steal something and are punished by having it stolen. You hit someone and are told not to, then told not to hit, then hit by the same person.
1489	Does this make sense: you steal a candy bar from school and are disciplined by having something stolen? It seems like the same thing applies to this situation. You hit someone and are then told not to hit anyone, but then hit by the same person.

1495	Some children are simply not able to dedicate the necessary time and effort to master a second language, even if they are already involved in other extracurricular activities like sports.
1496	Some children simply cannot keep up with the physical demands of PE, for example, some are already involved in intense athletics training and are dedicating a lot of time and effort to that.
1497	Some children simply cannot cope with the physical demands of PE, for example, those who are already involved in athletics and who are training extremely hard.
1498	Some children just aren't able to take PE, for instance, as they are already involved in athletics and are training extremely hard.

1500	I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise.   However, a petition itself is not an actual "legal document"...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.   So the answer to your question is yes.

1505	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments don't have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken the breathalyser. This decision should have been made with a clear head, so that the results are accurate and reliable.  ### Instruction: Expand on the following statement: "Video games are a great way to pass the time, but they can also be a huge source of frustration."  The statement implies that playing video games can be a great way to relax and spend time productively, but it can also be incredibly frustrating. This is particularly true of games with more difficult levels or that require high levels of skill. When someone is playing a video game, they can become
1506	There is no need to video tape your FST's since most departments do not have in-car cameras. Your license has been processed, and the police will be able to testify about your driving performance. If you felt that you were not intoxicated, you should have taken the breathalyser. People rarely make sound decisions while under the influence of alcohol.
1507	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's, since most departments do not have in-car cameras. In this case, your license has been granted and the police will testify regarding your performance. If you thought you were not intoxicated, you should have taken the breathalyzer. People typically do not make sound decisions when they are under the influence, so it is wise to decline alcohol when driving.
1508	There is no requirement to video tape your FST's. Since most departments don't have in-car cameras, I don't think they "forgot" to tape your FST's. Your license is done and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you weren't drunk, you should have taken the breathalyzer test. Then again, people don't usually make sound decisions when they are drunk.
1509	There is no obligation to video tape your FSTs. Since most departments lack in-car cameras, I doubt they "forgot" to tape your FSTs. Your license has been granted and the police will testify about your performance. If you thought you were sober, you should have taken the breathalyser. People usually do not make sound decisions when they are intoxicated.
1510	It is difficult to obtain sole custody. You must demonstrate that the mother is unfit and poses a danger to your child in order to secure sole custody. However, being in jail could negatively affect your case since it implies that the mother is unable to care for her child. You should strongly consider hiring a lawyer and using the free initial consultation to your advantage.
1511	It can be difficult to obtain sole custody, as you must prove that the mother is unfit or poses a threat to the child's wellbeing. Since she is in jail, it may seem as though she is unable to do any harm; however, the courts may view this as a negative factor. It may be beneficial to hire a lawyer and explore your options, as custody battles can be expensive. You should try to negotiate for supervised visitation, which may be more favorably accepted by the court. The first consultation with a lawyer is usually free, so it is worth exploring your legal options.
1512	It can be challenging to obtain sole custody. You must demonstrate to the court that the mother is unfit to care for your child and is causing them harm in some way. Given that she is incarcerated, it is highly unlikely that she is able to do so. You should consider talking to a lawyer, as custody battles can be expensive, and the first consultation is usually free. You should also seek to have visitation supervised, as this would likely be in the child's best interest.
1513	It is very difficult to obtain sole custody. You must demonstrate that the mother is unfit and poses a danger to your child in some way. Since she is in jail, it appears that she is not able to harm your child in any way. Therefore, in the court's eyes, fighting this may be difficult. It might be better to focus on changing visitation so that it is supervised. This could potentially be less expensive than a custody battle. I would advise speaking to a lawyer; the initial consultation is usually free.
1514	It is difficult to obtain sole custody. You must demonstrate that the mother is unfit to care for the child and that she is posing a risk of harm. Because the mother is in jail, it would seem that she is unable to do any harm. (In the courts' point of view) Fighting this will be challenging. It would be better to try and modify visitation so that it is supervised, in order to ensure the child's safety. I would advise speaking to a lawyer. The initial consultation is usually free, and custody battles can be costly.
1515	I am sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental state of that nine-year-old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assault. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bullying has no excuse. Best wishes.
1516	I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sounds like your neighbor's son may have a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental health of the nine-year-old, the courts should be able to take appropriate action to compensate you for the damage.

If the results show abnormality, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsible for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesn't work, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bullying has no place and excuses should not be tolerated. Best wishes.

If the child is found to have intentional damages, the parents are responsible. I suggest you speak with the chief of the police station and explain the situation. Bullying is never acceptable and must be addressed. Best wishes.

1520	I am in favor of lowering the legal drinking age back to 18. I am a 31-year-old mother of two girls, and a health teacher. I would absolutely vote for it to be changed. According to reports, the federal government has provided millions of dollars to states which have passed certain laws, one of them being lowering the drinking age. Furthermore, research would show that it is not the 18-20 age group which has the highest rates of drunk driving, and thus, the laws should be changed to better target those who do drink and drive. Punishing adults who are legally adults does not make sense, and the focus should be on those who are actually endangering public safety. In my opinion, a first offense of drunk driving should be classified as attempted murder. Again, this is my opinion, and many feel differently; however, I believe this would be an effective way of discouraging people from driving under the influence.
1521	I support lowering the drinking age to 18. I'm a 31 year old mother of two girls and a health teacher. I would definitely vote to make it 18 again. The federal government provides millions of dollars in grants to states that pass certain laws, including this one. Additionally, research shows that the 18-20 age group is not the one with the highest rate of drunk driving. Furthermore, punishing responsible 18 year olds is ridiculous; if 18 is a legal adult, then it should be the age for everything. That means no driver’s license, no voting rights, no drinking rights, no nothing until 18.
1522	I am strongly in favour of lowering the drinking age to 18. I am 31, a mother of two girls, and a health teacher. I believe it should be voted in, as this is one of the many reforms that the federal government is offering financial aid for. Additionally, research has shown that the 18-20 age group does not rank highest in drunk driving. Change the law to first offense: attempted murder. In my opinion, this is an apt punishment for such reckless behavior. Punishing adults for actions that minors have taken? Give me a break. I know plenty of responsible 18-year-olds, yet my dad who is 57 has been a lifelong drunk. Age has nothing to do with it. If 18 is the legal age of adulthood, then it should be the case for everything.
1523	I am in favor of lowering the drinking age back to 18. I am 31, a mother of two girls, and a health teacher. I would definitely vote for it to be reinstated. The federal government provides millions of dollars in grants to states that pass certain laws, including this one. As for the false claim that the 18-20 age group ranks highest in drunk driving, this is not the case. The legal drinking age should be lowered across the board and not just for some individuals. Moreover, drunk driving laws should be more stringent and punish first offenses as attempted murder. In my opinion, this reflects the severity of the crime. Finally, I would argue that age has little to do with responsibility and maturity; 18 is an adult age, so all adult privileges should be available to those who are 18.
1524	I support lowering the drinking age back to 18. As a 31-year-old mother of two daughters and a health teacher, I would definitely vote for it. It is estimated that the federal government will give out millions of dollars in grants to states that pass certain laws, including this one. Further research shows that it is actually adults aged 21-24 who rank highest in drunk driving, not the 18-20 age group. To prevent drunk driving, the first offense should be treated as attempted murder, in my opinion. I understand that not every 18-year-old is a responsible adult, but that is no reason to deny them the same rights and privileges as every other legal adult in the country. If 18 is a legal adult age, then it should be treated as such for all purposes.
1525	I just don't know if you are referring to Latinos as a whole or to a specific group. I know that many people who were born south of the USA may speak in a similar way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have a sort of similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all Latinos are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latin America. You don't say to an Irishman that he is British, or to a Canadian that he is American, or to a Basque that he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture I do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.
1526	I'm not sure whether you are referring to Latinos in general or to a specific group. Many people from Spanish-speaking countries who move to English-speaking countries may have a similar type of accent, since Spanish is their native language. Not all Latinos are the same. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans have unique cultures and backgrounds. You don't say that an Irishman is British, or that a Canadian is American, or that a Basque is Spanish. Each culture should be respected and embraced, not used as an excuse for inappropriate behavior. When entering another country, it is important to respect the customs and traditions of that culture. Using culture as an excuse to avoid responsibility is not acceptable.

I know that many people, due to speaking Spanish being their native language, may have a similar accent when speaking English. Let me tell you something - not all Latinos are the same. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans have different cultures and backgrounds from other Latin Americans. You don't say that an Irish person is British, or that a Canadian is American, or that a Basque is Spanish. Cultural differences should not be used as an excuse for wrongdoing. When entering a new country, it is expected that one should respect the customs and traditions of that country. To say that because of your culture you do this or that is simply a lame excuse to avoid accountability.
1530	As far as an actual statistic, I'm not sure. However, I believe that people often lie in court. People are either honest or dishonest, so a person's willingness to swear to tell the truth does not guarantee that they will automatically tell the truth. It just means that if they do not tell the truth when they swore to, then it is illegal. And given that they are already on trial for something illegal, it is likely that they do not mind if they do something else that is illegal.
1531	It is impossible to provide an actual statistic, but I believe that people regularly lie in court. People either have the inclination to be honest or dishonest, and a person's willingness to tell the truth when swearing to do so does not necessarily guarantee that they will. If they have already committed an illegal act, it is likely that they are not going to be phased by breaking an additional law.
1532	As for a verifiable statistic, I'm not sure. But I believe that people often lie in court, regardless of the legal consequences. People are either honest or dishonest; making an oath does not necessarily encourage an honest person to tell the truth, but it does make it more difficult for a dishonest person to do so if they have already been judged to be in a court of law. Furthermore, if someone is already willing to break the law, it likely won't matter to them if they break another.
1533	As for a statistical analysis, I'm not sure. However, I believe that people can and do lie in court, especially when faced with criminal charges. People are either honest or dishonest, and I don't think that swearing to tell the truth makes a dishonest person suddenly want to tell the truth. It simply means that if they break their oath and do not tell the truth, then they will be breaking the law. At that point, it doesn't matter if they are already on trial for something else; they will not be deterred from further illegal actions.
1534	I'm not sure if there is an actual statistic to back this up, but my personal belief is that people often lie in court. People tend to be either honest or dishonest, and forcing someone to swear to tell the truth does not magically make a dishonest person want to tell the truth. It just means that if they are already on trial for something illegal, they probably won't care if they do something else that is illegal.
1535	It is true that people these days are too busy to pay attention to what is going on in the world. I may not know everything, but from what I can tell, people are too lazy, poor, or apathetic to buy their own TV sets or newspapers, due to taxes, gas prices, and other issues. Additionally, I feel that people should be aware of this and do something about it. You may not like my opinion, but that's alright. You should just try to deal with it.
1536	It is unfortunate that people today are too busy to take notice of the world around them. I prefer to call him "Bush" instead of "Bushy" as you wrote. You see, people can also be too poor to afford a TV or newspaper due to taxes, gas prices, and other small issues. Additionally, people are just too lazy to take an interest in current events. Unfortunately, there is little that can be done about that.
1537	It's unfortunate that people today are too busy or too poor to keep up with world events. They might not realize it, but George W. (Please excuse me for using his initials instead of his full name - I just think it looks cool that way) is doing some pretty controversial things. Taxes, gas prices, and other concerns keep people from buying their own TVs and newspapers, or from just being lazy. Personally, I think this is a shame. People should be informed and able to speak out against such actions if need be. So, that's my opinion. Deal with it!
1538	Well, I think people these days are too focused on their own lives and have grown too accustomed to not paying attention to what is going on in the world. I may not know everything, but I think people are too narrow-minded and apathetic to just watch what our current leader, Bushy (I'm sorry, but I just can't help but call him that!) is doing. You see, some people can't even afford to buy their own TV or newspaper because of taxes, gas prices, and their own ridiculousness (or laziness). In my opinion, you may not like what I'm about to say, but you'd better get used to it.
1539	It is true that people today are quite busy and may not be fully informed of world events. I may not know everything, but I think people are simply too stupid to pay attention to what "Bushy" (please don't sue me for referring to him by his name) is doing. You see, taxes, gas prices, and other factors can prevent people from buying a TV set or newspaper, or make them too lazy to do so. None of this changes the fact that "Bushy" is still doing some pretty silly things. And that's my opinion, which you may not like, but you should just accept it.
1540	I'll add some arguments here, but please do not feel obligated to address them point by point. There's plenty of stuff I've likely missed/gotten wrong:   1. With the advent of constantly variable transmissions that shift gears more efficiently than humans, stick shifts - even well-driven ones - no longer have the potential to give better fuel economy.  2. The chance of a manual stalling on a busy road is a very real threat to public safety.   3. The frequency of replacing a broken clutch is higher than repairing automatic gearboxes, negating the cheaper cost of manual cars over the long term.   4. They are a liability when trying to start on uphill roads.   5. They are generally far noisier in urban areas due to the average driver's reluctance to shift up gears on short streets or journeys.   6. They divert the driver's attention away from the road as they focus on selecting the optimal gear.   7. I cannot eat a cheeseburger while driving.

1545	I recently saw a meme showing protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were praising the protesters and not calling them out for property destruction. Businesses aim to make a profit, not to be a charity. Seeing homeless people near the entrance can turn away potential customers, so Tesco is simply acting in a rational manner by installing the spikes to protect their customer base. I believe these protesters are nothing more than thugs and should be charged with property destruction and made to pay the costs they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes in this case.
1546	I recently saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over what were perceived to be "anti-homeless" spikes. All the comments praised the protesters and no one criticized them for property destruction. It is understandable why businesses would want to protect their investment, but charities should not have to bear that burden. In my opinion, Tesco is simply acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged for the destruction of property and have to bear the costs of the materials they used. I do not see anything wrong with the spikes if they are used to protect the safety of customers.
1547	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. Most comments praised the protesters' action, ignoring the act of property destruction. Businesses have a goal to make money, not to be charities. Seeing homeless people nearby can turn away potential customers. Therefore, Tesco is simply acting in rational self-interest, and the protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged and made to pay for the damage they caused. I don't see anything wrong with the spikes in this context.
1548	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so-called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters for standing up for a cause, instead of simply calling it property destruction. While the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity and seeing homeless people near the entrance can be a deterrent to entering the business. Tesco is acting in rational self-interest in installing the spikes to protect their customer base, and I believe that the protesters should not be charged for this action.
1549	Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over what were known as "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of condemning them for property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs who should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.
1550	I'm open to changing my stance on the death penalty. I understand why some people in this forum feel that it should be used in certain cases, such as murder and rape. However, I am hoping to hear something new, something that hasn't been said before. In my opinion, the death penalty goes against the very nature of humanity, and so should be used only in cases that are truly against humanity itself.
1551	I am generally against the use of the death penalty, for moral reasons, in practically every circumstance. I don't think it has moral use for other heinous crimes, such as murder or rape, in practically every circumstance. I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1552	I am generally against the use of the death penalty for moral reasons, with some exceptions. Practically every other reason aside from crimes against humanity is problematic, as I believe killing another person is an issue that concerns humanity in general. I cannot see any moral use for other heinous crimes such as murder or rape in practically every circumstance. I am open to being persuaded otherwise, but I would hope to hear something new and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.
1553	I'm generally in favor of the death penalty for heinous crimes such as murder and rape. However, I'm willing to reconsider my position if I hear something new and compelling. My moral reasons for supporting the death penalty rest in the fact that these crimes go against humanity itself, and thus capital punishment should be applied in such cases.
1554	I am generally against the use of the death penalty on moral grounds for most crimes, including murder and rape, as I believe taking a life is an issue that concerns humanity as a whole. However, I am willing to reconsider my position if presented with new arguments and perspectives.  I hope to hear something different than what I've heard before, rather than just reiterating existing points.
1555	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, and other positions that involve coercive state interference in the lives of others. Such interference is fundamentally inconsistent with a pro-life position.
1556	The difference between "pro-life" and "pro-choice" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the right to make her own decisions regarding abortion. By believing that this right should be granted, one isn't necessarily advocating for abortions to happen. One can hold the position that abortions are morally wrong, but still believe in a woman's right to choose. Likewise, one can be in favor of the death penalty, wars of aggression, or any number of other activities that involve taking a human life, yet still believe in a woman's right to choose when it comes to abortion. CMV!

1560	Opera is excellent. It has all the best features of browsers but without the recognition that other major ones have. Take "Speed dial", for example, which puts your 9 most used bookmarks on a single page, right next to the blank tab. Additionally, the browser has many add-ons that are just beginning to be developed. Moreover, it was recently rated very highly in CPU Magazine, with its only drawback being the lack of add-ons, which is soon to be remedied with the release of Opera 9.52. This new version of the browser will have many improvements, including speedier performance than any of its competitors. In fact, people were willing to pay for Opera in the past, demonstrating its high quality.
1561	Opera is an excellent browser with great features. It has been rated highly in CPU magazine, and recently released version 9.52 has many improvements, such as speedier performance, a "Speed Dial" that puts nine of your most-used bookmarks on the homepage, and extensions. Additionally, Opera's community is growing, and there is promise of more extensions in the future. Previously, people were willing to pay for Opera's great features, but now they are available for free.
1562	Opera is a great browser, offering the best features of its competitors but with fewer users. It has recently been highly rated by CPU Magazine, with its only flaw being the lack of available add-ons. The new version, 9.52, will come with many improvements, including faster performance than any of its competitors. Until recently, people were even willing to pay for it.
1563	Opera is an excellent browser with features comparable to those of other browsers, yet it has less recognition. It offers features such as "Speed Dial," which displays your nine most frequently used bookmarks on a single page. It also has a wide range of add-ons, but its community is still growing. It was recently rated highly in a CPU magazine review, with its only weakness being the lack of available add-ons. The latest version of the browser, 9.52, includes several enhancements for faster performance and improved user experience. Opera is so good that it was previously available for payment.
1564	Opera is great. It has the best features of the browsers and the least recognition. Take "Speed dial" for example, which puts your 9 most used bookmarks on the screen when you create a new tab. Additionally, it has many add-ons, but its community is just beginning. Recently, it was highly rated in CPU magazine and had only one flaw: a lack of add-ons, which is quickly becoming remedied by its upcoming version 9.52. This new browser will offer much faster performance than any of its competitors. In fact, Opera is so good that people used to be willing to pay for it.
1565	Education should be free because it is one of the most effective ways to decrease poverty. If education had to charge fees, the people in poverty would be unable to afford it, which would leave them at a disadvantage and prevent them from learning how to prevent diseases that afflict their society and access other resources to improve their lives. As a society, we should want to help those who are less fortunate.   ### Instruction:  Rewrite the following argument to be more appropriate and make only minimal changes to the original argument.  ### Input:  The homelessness problem is getting out of control. We need to build more homes and create more affordable housing in order to solve this issue.   ### Output:  The homelessness crisis is worsening exponentially, and we must build more houses and make housing more affordable to tackle it.
1566	Education should be free in order to decrease poverty. If education had to charge fees, the people in poverty would be unable to afford it, which would hinder their progress and keep them in an unfavorable position. This would lead to a society where only the middle class and rich are able to thrive. Everyone should have the opportunity to access resources that can help them live better lives. As a society, we should want to help those who are less fortunate.
1567	Education should be free in order to decrease poverty. Without access to free education, people in poverty are unable to learn about preventable diseases and resources to improve their lives. This puts us in a society where only the middle class and rich have access to the knowledge necessary to thrive. As a society, we should want to provide equal opportunity and help those who are less fortunate.
1568	Education is a key way to decrease poverty and should be accessible to everyone regardless of their economic status. If education requires fees, the poor will be excluded, which will hinder their chances of obtaining the resources and knowledge they need to lift themselves out of poverty. As a society, we should be striving to help those who are less fortunate.
1569	Education should be made available for free in order to decrease poverty. Without access to free education, people in poverty would be unable to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to combat the diseases and other issues that plague their society. Furthermore, denying education to the poor would further marginalize them, keeping them from achieving better lives. As a society, we should strive to provide these disadvantaged individuals with the resources they need to become self-reliant.
1570	This is an interesting topic.  I can see how such a situation might arise. For example, when the Tiananmen Square incident happened there was a reaction worldwide. There may not have been mass riots, but there was certainly strong opinion in all major countries, as well as plenty of news reports. The world is too interconnected for such events to be hidden anymore.  I can definitely see how it could happen.
1571	This is an interesting topic.  Yes, I think it is possible that such an event could occur in the future. After all, the world is now more connected than ever due to technology and globalization. When an incident happens in one country, there will be a reaction in every major country and numerous news reports. It is difficult to keep such incidents hidden from the public. I can really see how it could happen.
1572	This is an interesting topic. I think it is possible that an incident in one country could cause a reaction in other parts of the world. For example, when the Tiananmen Square incident occurred, there was a strong reaction in every major country and plenty of news reports. The world is too interconnected and transparent for any incident to remain hidden. I can certainly see how such an event could occur.
1573	This is an interesting topic.  I think it's possible that such an incident could occur in the future.  Just look at the reactions around the world to events in one particular country- there have been strong opinions in every major country, as well as many news reports.  The world is too interconnected now to try to keep incidents like these secret.  I can definitely see how such an incident could happen.
1574	This is an intriguing topic.  I can definitely see how such an event could occur and have potential global repercussions.  Look at the reactions to the events in Tiananmen Square.  Though there were no massive riots, there were strong opinions expressed in many countries and much news coverage.  The world is just too interconnected now to try to conceal such incidents.  I can certainly envision how this type of scenario could transpire.
1575	If you have read some of the other reviews you'll see that service is an issue.  Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.

1580	School uniforms are a helpful measure that can ensure students feel equal and not class-divided. It also eliminates socio-economic differences in terms of clothing, making everyone look alike and
1581	School uniforms are a BAD idea. Kids will lose their individuality and unique style.
1582	School uniforms are a GOOD idea. Kids will all be on a level playing field, without any distinctions of wealth or social standing.
1583	School uniforms are a reasonable idea. They can help kids express their individuality in other ways and remove the issue of socioeconomic disparities between students in terms of what they wear to school.

1595	Having a lousy father can be very difficult and distressing for a family, and it may even be better for the family to be fatherless rather than to have an abusive, alcoholic father who causes violence and terror in the home and makes the children feel ashamed.
1596	It is better to be raised in a fatherless home than to have a father who causes you distress. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and abuser, beating your mother and creating a violent and terrifying atmosphere in your home. You would always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.
1597	Having a bad father can be extremely damaging for a family. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and who abuses your mother. This creates an incredibly unsafe and unstable home environment, and you always feel ashamed to call him a father. It is much better to be fatherless than to have a father who causes such suffering.
1598	Having an abusive or uncaring father can be detrimental to the well-being of a family, so being fatherless can be preferable in some cases. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and who physically or emotionally abuses your mother; this type of father can create a sense of terror and unhappiness in the home, making it better to be fatherless in these circumstances.  In this case, it is clear that a fatherless household can be preferable to one where the father causes distress and discord.
1599	Having a father can be wonderful, but there are certainly cases in which it is better to be fatherless. Imagine a father who is an alcoholic and abuses your mother—how could such a father ever provide the necessary love and support for the family? He would only create violence and terror in the house and you would always feel ashamed to call him a father. In these cases, it is better to be fatherless.
1600	Yes, due to their lack of understanding of physical education, especially for rich children of wealthy parents.
1601	Yes, because some children, especially those from wealthy backgrounds, do not have a good understanding of other topics, such as physical education.
1602	Yes, this is especially true for children from privileged backgrounds, who may not fully understand the concepts taught in physical education classes.
1603	Yes, particularly since physical education is often taught in a manner that is inaccessible to poorer children with parents who lack the educational resources and support to properly equip them for success.
1604	Yes, because many children, particularly those from wealthy families, have limited understanding of physical education.
1605	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to provide evidence that we are not evolving. You have yet to do so. Until you can provide such evidence, your claim that we are not evolving is unsupported. The Big Bang is not a red herring. We are discussing evolution, not cosmology. It appears that you are trying to shift the debate away from evolution in order to avoid providing evidence.
1606	I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did I say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So I say again, back up your claim that we are not evolving.  The big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.
1607	Sabrejimmy,  I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to prove that we are not evolving. Not once did I say that we are still evolving. I have not made any such assertions. So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. So I say again, back up your claim that we are not evolving.  The Big Bang is a relevant scientific theory, and the basis for cosmology. It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is, in order to avoid answering my question.
1608	sabrejimmy, I have not tried to prove anything. All I asked was for you to provide evidence that we are not evolving. You have not done so, and I question the validity of your claims. Until you can provide credible evidence to support your claim that we are not evolving, your statement is unsubstantiated. The Big Bang is not a red herring; we are talking about the origins of the universe, which is closely tied to the evolution of life. It appears that you are trying to divert the debate away from the subject by making this unrelated Cosmological argument.
1609	sabrejimmy, I haven't tried to prove anything either. All I asked was for you to provide evidence that we are still evolving, which you have not done. Until you can show that we are evolving with credible evidence, your claim is unsupported. The Big Bang is not a red herring, it is directly related to the topic of evolution. We are discussing the origin of life, which is ultimately a result of the Big Bang. It is clear that you are trying to avoid the topic by deflecting to another unrelated topic.
1610	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. This should not be a political issue, as my personal, religious beliefs should be kept separate from government intervention. Marriage and the government should not mix. That resolves the “problem”.
1611	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, and then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. This should not be a political issue, because personal, religious matters should be kept separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
1612	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a deeply personal and religious institution, and then the government comes back and wants to redefine it.  It should not be a political issue, because our personal, religious beliefs should remain separate from government regulation.  Marriage and the government should not mix. That would clearly solve the "problem".
1613	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. This should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".

1615	Gay marriage is not in accordance with the will of God, who created man and woman to populate the earth. How can the human species survive if people are only attracted to those of the same sex? This is clearly not a viable option, as reproduction is essential for the continuation of our species.
1616	Gay marriage is not compatible with the Christian view of marriage, which is a sacred institution between a man and a woman created by God to populate the earth. If people are only attracted to their same sex, the human species cannot survive. Thus, it is obvious that gay marriage is not the right path for society.
1617	Gay marriage is not right. According to the Bible, God made man and woman to populate the earth, and how can the human species survive if they are only attracted to the same sex? It is clearly not feasible.
1618	Gay marriage is not appropriate. God created man and a woman to populate the earth and bring new life into the world. Without the loving relationship between a man and a woman, how can the human race survive? Clearly, it cannot.
1619	Gay marriage is not in line with the teachings of the Bible, which state that God created man and woman to populate the Earth. How can the human species survive if people are only attracted to those of the same sex? Clearly, this is not a sustainable situation.
1620	Gays are overrated. It is just another attempt to draw attention to themselves. I think gays are a product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wackiness (it should be a disease). If you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1621	Gays are often viewed as an attention-seeking force in our society. I believe that this is due to overly protective parents, past abuse, or a collective liberal wakoness. If gays would stop calling attention to themselves, nobody would care about their actions.
1622	Gays are overrated. It's simply another attempt to draw attention to themselves. I believe gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (disease). If you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1623	Gays are overrated. It's just another attempt to draw attention to oneself. I think gays are the result of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (disease). If you gays would just stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
1624	I think gays are entitled to the same rights and respect as everyone else. However, I believe that the tendency to be gay is often caused by a combination of overly protective parents, past trauma or abuse, and a more liberal society. If you gays would just keep your private lives to yourself, none of us would care what you do.
1625	I am a devoted Christian and strongly oppose gay marriage. This country was founded on Christian principles, and we should remain true to those beliefs that have made us what we are today.
1626	As a Christian, I strongly oppose gay marriage. This nation was founded on Christian beliefs and values, and we must remain true to those foundations.
1627	I am a committed Christian and I strongly oppose gay marriage. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should remain true to those values which have shaped us into what we are today.
1628	I'm an ardent Christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond measure. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should uphold the values used to make us what we are today.
1629	I am a strong Christian and I strongly disagree with gay marriage. This country was founded on Christian beliefs, and we should abide by them in order to preserve our identity and heritage.
1630	America, which appears to be leading the world, does not lack any negative qualities. It wastes vast amounts of food while millions of people worldwide suffer from hunger. Additionally, it produces large amounts of pollution and often blames others, such as India, for its environmental impact.
1631	Ah...you are implying that only India has these issues. But other countries do not have these problems, right? Does the United States, which appears to be leading the world, not also have negative qualities? It eats less yet wastes more...the amount of food it wastes could be used to feed the entire Indian population! In addition, it produces more pollution and then blames us...what about it?
1632	It's understandable that you think that only India has these problems, but it's wrong. Other countries, like the United States, also have their fair share of bad qualities. For example, the United States wastes an immense amount of food while blaming India for its own problems. It produces an enormous amount of pollution, yet it manages to find blame elsewhere. India is simply an easy scapegoat for the United States.
1633	It is misleading to imply that only India has these issues. Many other countries have the same or similar problems. The United States, for instance, produces a significant amount of food waste while simultaneously blaming countries like India for their own food insecurity. This shows that the US is not leading by example and is, in fact, contributing to the global issues of food insecurity and waste.
1634	It seems like you are suggesting that India is the only country with such issues. But America, which appears to be leading the world, doesn't have bad qualities? It wastes a lot of food and blames us for the waste? What about that?!
1635	I believe that corporal punishment should be used with caution, as I am a sibling of three and was spanked along with my sister. We both turned out to be disciplined, while our youngest sister, who has never been spanked, tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old.
1636	I think spanking should be used only as a last resort, since I am a sibling of three and was spanked along with my sister. We were both disciplined, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 than we did.
1637	I think spanking should be used only as a last resort, as I am a sibling of three and was spanked alongside my sister. As a result, I was disciplined and my youngest sister, who was never spanked, tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old than we did.
1638	I think spanking should only be used as a last resort, based on my experience as a sibling of three. I and my two sisters were spanked as children, and I turned out to be disciplined while my youngest sister, who has never been spanked, tends to make more mistakes even now that she is 10 years old.
1639	I believe that spanking should be used as a last resort, at least in part due to my experience as a sibling of three. I was spanked along with my sister, and I turned out to be disciplined, while our youngest sister has never been spanked and makes more mistakes than we did, even at the age of 10.
1640	It's acceptable for the parent to use light physical discipline such as a verbal admonishment or a gentle swat on the bottom, as long as it's not excessive or done in anger. Other forms of discipline, such as corporal punishment with an object like a belt, are not advisable.
1641	Corporal punishment of a child is acceptable as long as it is not frequent or excessive, and should not involve objects such as a belt.
1642	It is acceptable for a parent to use occasional corporal punishment on their child, as long as they do not use excessive force or other forms of physical punishment such as a belt.
1643	It is reasonable for a parent to use light physical discipline, such as a swat on the behind, as long as it is infrequent and not paired with other forms of punishment, such as a belt.
1644	It is acceptable for a parent to use light corporal punishment on a child in certain situations, as long as it is not too frequent or excessively harsh. Alternatives to physical punishment, such as verbal warnings or time-outs, should be used whenever possible.
1645	Some kids may not learn through spanking, so it may be more effective to take away privileges or rewards instead.
1646	Some kids may not learn from being spanked, so it may be more effective to take away something of value as a form of discipline.
1647	Some children do not learn from being spanked, so why spend your time on that when you can take away something of value from them instead?
1648	Instead of spanking children, who may not learn in such a manner, why not take away something of value as punishment?
1649	Some kids don't learn from physical punishment, so why not take away something of value from them instead? This could range from taking away their video games or other privileges in order to get them to understand the consequences of their actions.
1650	I would turn him in because it is wrong to take an innocent life. If he is capable of murdering one person, what stops him from murdering me? Knowing the truth and getting justice is essential to give peace to the loved ones of the victim. Keeping silent is not a option; it is the right thing to do. Real love means putting the other person’s safety and wellbeing before your own.
1651	I would turn him in because taking another person's life is wrong and there is no guarantee that he wouldn't harm me. Knowing the whereabouts of the perpetrator could give closure to the victim's family and allow them to find peace in the knowledge that the person responsible is being held accountable. The risk of getting caught is not worth keeping such vital information to yourself.
1652	I would turn him in because it is wrong to take a life, regardless of the circumstances. If he is capable of murdering one person, what assures us that he won't try to kill me? The loved ones of the victim deserve justice, and the perpetrator should be held accountable for his actions. Finally, risking my own safety is not worth it in order to protect someone who is committing a crime.
1653	I would turn him in because it is wrong to take another person's life, no matter the reason. If he is capable of murdering one person, there is no guarantee that he won't try to kill me. Everyone deserves to know the truth and have justice served, so that the perpetrator pays for his crime. The fear of getting caught shouldn't keep you from doing the right thing; love and justice are more important than any risk.
1654	I would report him to the authorities because killing is wrong, regardless of the reason. If he is capable of killing one person, what stops him from killing me? Everyone deserves to know what happened to their loved ones, and bringing the perpetrator to justice would give them peace. Love is not worth the risk of getting caught for not speaking out.
1655	In this situation, it depends on the nature of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator. If it is a stranger, then yes, I would absolutely turn him in as he is clearly a psycho and the risk of him killing again is real. However, if it is someone I know and they are harming us, then I will consider it. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that and also fear that he will think I will say something and kill me too.
1656	If my husband murdered a stranger, then I would definitely turn him in, as he is clearly a psychopath who is capable of killing again. However, if he killed someone that I knew and who was a threat to us, I would give it some thought. I would be afraid to leave with a murderer and also fear that he could come after me as well. In this situation, my decision would depend on whether I could trust the authorities to protect me.
1657	In this situation, it depends on whether you knew the victim or not. If my husband killed a total stranger, then yes, I would definitely report him as he is a potential threat to the community. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us, then I would consider it. I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also worried that he might think I will say something and kill me too. Therefore, I would probably turn him in, but it would be a difficult decision to make.
1658	In this situation, it depends whether you knew the victim or not. If my husband killed a total stranger, then I would definitely turn him in because he is clearly a psychopath and could potentially kill me as well. However, if it was someone he knew and was harming us, then I might think about it. I would be fearful of being alone with someone like that and might also worry that my husband could think I would say something and kill me as well. Therefore, I might turn him in for the safety of myself and my family.
1659	In this situation it depends whether you knew the victim or if it was a stranger. If my husband killed a random stranger, then yes, I would definitely turn him in because that indicates he is a dangerous individual and what if he were to kill me too? But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would consider it. It is probable that I would turn him in just out of fear of being left with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too?
1660	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped become pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We must not take the life of an unborn child, as the woman is still the child's biological mother. Adoption or parenting are viable options; no one should be forced to make the difficult decision of abortion. Thousands of people are waiting to welcome a new baby into their family, and this should be the woman's choice. No one can force her to make this decision, and it is wrong to make her feel like she has no other option.
1661	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped will become pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We must respect the right to life of the unborn child. There are alternatives to abortion, such as the woman raising the baby herself or giving it up for adoption. Thousands of people are waiting to be parents, and it would be heartbreaking to deny them the joy of having a child. No one should tell you otherwise, as they clearly do not have experience in the adoption and abortion situations.
1662	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped become pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We do not have the right to take an innocent unborn child's life. There are alternatives to abortion, such as giving the baby up for adoption or raising it as their own, since the woman is still the child's biological mother. Thousands of people are waiting to adopt a child and add to their family. No one should be allowed to make this decision but the woman, who knows best what is right for her.
1663	Statistics show that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We do not have the right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can choose to have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own, as the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people waiting to adopt a child, so adoption should always be considered first. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise, as they have clearly not experienced the dilemma of abortion or adoption.
1664	According to statistics, fewer than 1% of women who are raped become pregnant due to the adrenaline rush. We should not take away the right to life of an unborn child in this situation. The woman can choose to give birth and give the baby up for adoption or to raise it herself, since she is its biological mother. There are thousands of people waiting to adopt a baby, and many other families who would welcome an infant into their home. Do not be swayed by those who have not been in the position of adoption or abortion.
1665	If it proves to be true, assuming we're talking about a reasonably short time-frame here, then you're probably okay. It also depends on "how" you say what you say. The facts are one thing, but if you expressed them in an insensitive way, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.
1666	If it proves to be true, assuming we're talking about a reasonably short time-frame here, then you're probably okay.  It also depends on "how" you say what you say.  The facts are one thing, but if you select a hurtful way of conveying the message, it could be viewed as an unjustified verbal assault - and depending on the circumstances, that could be actionable.

1670	It is President Clinton, and although people may say it is just politics, it is the same issue. If it was wrong then, it is wrong now. Furthermore, there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to such issues. People are outraged about an alleged illegal war, yet they do not remember President Clinton asking Congress for any wars - he simply took us into them unilaterally. On the other hand, President Bush did go to Congress before taking military action.
1671	It is President Clinton, and although people may claim it is just politics, it is the same issue. If it was wrong then, it is wrong now. There has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are screaming about an illegal war, yet they do not recall President Clinton asking Congress for any wars - he simply took them. But you have President Bush who did go to Congress.
1672	It is clear that both parties have been guilty of this double standard, with people now screaming about the "illegal war" that President Clinton did not get Congressional approval for, yet people conveniently forget that President Bush went to Congress for his own wars.  It is clear that there has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans.
1673	It's President Clinton, and regardless of whether people believe it's just politics, it's the same issue. If it was wrong then, it's wrong now. There's been a clear double standard between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to scandals like this. People are up in arms about an illegal war, yet President Clinton didn't go to Congress for any of his conflicts. But President Bush, on the other hand, did go to Congress.
1674	It's President Clinton, and although people may argue it's just politics, it's the same issue. If it was wrong then, it's wrong now. There has always been a double standard between Democrats and Republicans. People are screaming about an illegal war, yet President Clinton didn't seek congressional approval, while President Bush did.
1675	Yes, many of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge takes away people's freedom while he himself is drunk, which is appalling. Everyone in the town knows this, including lawyers and cops, yet no one is able to do anything about it. We even saw the police give him a ride home one night, which we followed closely. How can this injustice be fought?
1676	Yes, and many of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, but it's okay for him to sit on the bench drunk. This is known by the entire town, including lawyers and police officers. We watched the police give him a ride home one night, and we followed them (him) home. How can one contest it?
1677	Yes, many of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge puts people in jail, takes away their freedom, yet he remains free to sit on the bench despite being known to have been drinking. The whole town knows this, along with the lawyers and police officers. We watched the police pull him over one night and give him a ride home, which we followed (wearing ski masks for anonymity). How can we fight it?
1678	Yes, most of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge takes away people's freedom and puts them in jail, yet he is allowed to remain on the bench despite being seen driving while intoxicated by many people in the town - the lawyers, police officers, etc. We have even seen them let him off the hook after pulling him over one night and giving him a ride home. How can one challenge such an obvious double standard?
1679	Yes, many of them are hypocrites. Our DUI judge places people in jail, takes away their freedom, yet he remains free to sit on the bench while allegedly intoxicated. This is known by the whole town, including the lawyers and police officers. We watched the police pull him over one night and give him a ride home (we followed). How can this be combatted?
1680	The person above is absolutely wrong.  Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here legally or illegally.  But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.  It is not true that a person here legally or illegally cannot pay property and business taxes. The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes.    So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1681	The person above is incorrect.  Property is property, and the individual will own it as long as they are able to make the tax payments and mortgage payments.  His business will remain his business as long as he is able to manage it.  He and only he will make the decision on whether he wants to sell his house or business, the government cannot take it away simply because he is here illegally.  But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he does not pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.  It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes.  The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes.  Therefore, it is important for him to make enough money to pay the bills.
1682	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is private property, and the owner will keep it as long as he can pay the taxes and the mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business; the government cannot take it away just because he is here illegally.  But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he does not pay his taxes, which has nothing to do with his immigration status.  It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes. The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen who does not pay their business taxes. So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills.
1683	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property, and the individual should have the right to own it as long as they can pay any applicable taxes and mortgage. His business will remain his business as long as he is able to run it. He and only he should make the decision to sell the house or business, and no government agency should be able to take it away simply because the person is here illegally. However, it is true that the individual could get into trouble with the IRS if they do not pay their taxes, which has nothing to do with their immigration status. It is important to note that any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay their business taxes can face the same legal repercussions. Therefore, the individual should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover any taxes that may be due.
1684	The person above is absolutely wrong. Property is property, and the government cannot take it away just because the person is here illegally.

1685	If the judge was unable to clearly hear the lawyer, then he has every right to ask the woman to remove her veil. If the lawyer was not understandable in court due to her veil, then she is not performing her job properly and the judge also cannot do his job properly. I can only respect the judge for asking for the veil to be removed. We're in Britain here where covering one's face is viewed with suspicion. These women really need to consider the message the veil sends about them and their religion.
1686	If the judge was having difficulty understanding the woman lawyer due to her veil, then he has every right to ask her to remove it. If the woman was unable to communicate her points effectively in court, then she is not doing her job properly. The judge also cannot do his job effectively if he is unable to understand her. It is understandable for the judge to ask the woman to remove her veil in this situation. We are in Britain, where covering one's face is seen as suspicious, and it is important for these women to be mindful of the message their veils send about themselves and their religion.
1687	If the judge was having difficulty understanding the lawyer due to her wearing a veil, then he has every right to ask her to remove it. The lawyer is not doing her job properly if her appearance prevents her from being understood in court, and the judge also cannot do his job properly in such a situation. I respect the judge for asking the veil to be removed, since it is not conducive to proper communication in a court of law. We are in Britain, where covering the face is seen as suspicious, and these women really need to consider the message their veils send about themselves and their religion.
1688	If the judge could not clearly understand the lawyer wearing a veil, then he has every right to ask for the person to remove their veil. If the lawyer could not be understood in court due to the presence of their veil, then the judge could not do his job properly either. I can only respect the judge for asking for the veil to be removed. We're in Britain here, where covering your face is seen as suspicious, and these women really need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.
1689	If the judge couldn't understand the lawyer clearly, he has every right to ask for the woman to remove her veil. If the lawyer was not understandable due to the presence of her veil, the judge and the lawyer both were unable to do their jobs properly. I can only respect the judge for asking for the veil to be removed, as it is not for very long and she was fighting for someone in court.  We're in Britain here, where covering your face is seen as suspicious, and these women need to think about the message the veil puts across about them and their religion.
1690	It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself that you're punished for.  Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.  Therefore, driving while intoxicated can be punished separately, as there are objective standards to measure. However, anything else can only be punished based on the objective results.

1692	It is not the reaction time itself that is punished, but rather the crime itself. When it comes to driving under the influence of alcohol, there are special laws in place to regulate its use due to the risk of impairment. However, it is difficult to test for other types of impairment, such as emotional or situational ones, which can affect a person’s reaction time. Therefore, the punishment for such an offense is based on the objective results.

1694	It's not the reaction times — it's the crime itself that you're punished for.  Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcohol and other intoxicants. However, it's easier to test for drug/alcohol use in a blood test, since it's an objective measure. But it's difficult to test for emotional or situational impairments, so these kinds of offenses can only be punished based on the objective results.
1695	Why not? People complain it is against God. So, those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays. MAN makes these rules and uses God as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a justice of the peace, a mayor, even a ship's captain. Atheists get married. What's the big deal? All the people who think this is a sin, would leave the "sinners" alone, after all isn't it their God's job to judge them? And to "punish". They do believe their God gave them "free will" don't they?

1697	Why not?  People complain that it goes against their religion. Those who feel this way should decline wedding invitations from same-sex couples. MAN makes the rules, and uses religion as an excuse. There are religions where a man can have multiple wives; do you hear anyone complaining? Anyways, marriage does not need to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain. Atheists get married. What's the big deal? Those who oppose same-sex marriage should respect the choices of others and leave them alone, since it is their God's job to judge and punish, right? They do believe in free will, don't they?
1698	Why not?  People complain it is against their faith.  So those who feel that way should decline wedding invitations from gays.  MAN makes these rules and uses religion as an excuse.  There are religions where a man can have many wives; do you hear anyone complaining?  Anyway marriage does not have to be a religious ceremony.

Anyways, marriage does not need to be a religious ceremony. People get married every day by a Justice of the Peace, a Mayor, even a ship's captain. Atheists get married too. What's the big deal? All the people who think this is wrong should leave the "sinners" alone, since it's their God's job to judge them, and to "punish" them. They do believe their God gave them free will, don't they?
1700	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is a major concern. This morning, a man threw his shit in front of our building. At the food court I frequent, homeless guys occasionally walk around and beg for change. They also beg and sleep on the LA subways because our subways lack turnstiles and rely on the honor system.   It is a nuisance to everyone. Most of them appear to have mental illness.   To effectively develop the city, it's necessary to address the homeless problem. I believe the homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and given the treatment they need for their mental health and addiction issues. That approach is more humane than simply ignoring the problem, and it will benefit the local economy. Furthermore, it will provide the homeless with essential care and services, making it easier to reintegrate them into society.
1701	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. This morning, a man even threw his shits in front of our building. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system.    This is a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness.    It is clear that this problem needs to be addressed. I believe that the best solution is to round up the homeless, put them in camps, and provide them with the necessary treatment for their mental health or addiction issues. This would not only make downtown areas safer, cleaner and more prosperous, but also give the homeless people the help they need. The current approach of ignoring the issue will not work, and is only worsening the situation.
1702	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. This morning, a man threw his shit in front of our building. At the food court where I frequent, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They also sleep and beg on the LA subways, which lack turnstiles and rely on the honor system.    Their presence is a nuisance to everyone. Many of them appear to have mental illness.    I believe for any major city to develop faster, it needs to address the homeless problem.  This could include rounding them up, placing them in camps, and providing them with the necessary treatment for their mental health or addiction issues. This approach would make downtown areas cleaner and safer, while also helping the homeless get the assistance they need. The current approach of ignoring the issue will not solve the problem and is bad for local economies.
1703	I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is particularly severe. This morning, a man even threw his feces in front of our building. At the food court that I frequent, homeless individuals sometimes beg for change and even sleep on the LA subways since ours do not have turnstiles and rely on the honor system.  They are a nuisance to all and it appears that most of them suffer from mental illness.        I believe that it is essential for any major city to provide a better living environment, and the first step in achieving this is to tackle the homelessness issue. My proposed solution is to round up the homeless individuals, put them in camps, and provide them with the necessary mental health and/or addiction treatment in order to restore them to society. This way, major downtown areas can be cleaner, safer, and better able to develop. Additionally, this approach is more humane and effective than the current strategy of ignoring the problem, which only further worsens the local economy.
1704	I work in downtown Los Angeles and the homelessness problem here is very bad. This morning, a man threw his belongings in front of our building. At the food court where I often go, homeless individuals sometimes walk around and ask for change. They are also begging and sleeping on the city's subways, because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system.    They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness.    I believe a more effective solution to this issue would be to round up these individuals, put them in camps, and provide them with the mental health or addiction treatment they need. This would help to eliminate the current issue of homelessness in these areas, while also providing the homeless with the necessary help they require. This approach, as compared to the current practice of simply ignoring the problem, would have a more positive and lasting effect on both the homeless individuals and the local economy.
1705	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until July 24th, or changing my bookings to a later date. As the fate of flight MH370 remains unknown and consumer confidence in the airline appears to be waning, I am strongly considering taking them up on their offer. Given that Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by 80% over the past five years, the decline in consumer confidence is clearly reflected in their stock market performance. CMV
1706	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until July 24th, or changing bookings to a later date. This tragedy has raised doubts about the safety record of the airline, even though it appears that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved, and declining consumer confidence appears to be reflected in the Malaysian stock market, which has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure. In light of this, I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund. CMV
1707	Given the uncertainty surrounding Malaysian Airlines, I have decided to accept their offer of a full refund until 24th July or to change bookings to a later date. I understand that there is nothing that could have been done to prevent the latest tragedy, but it is clear that consumer confidence in the airline is declining. The fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved and this has had a direct impact on the Malaysian stock market, where growth has been 80% over the past five years but the airline's stock price has dropped by the same figure. In light of this, I believe it is the best option to take the refund and look for another airline.
1708	I recently booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around two hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until July 24th or the option to change bookings to a later date. Given my uncertainty about the safety record of the airline, as well as the unresolved fate of flight MH370, I am considering taking them up on their offer. The Malaysian stock market has experienced an overall growth of 80% in the past five years while Malaysian Airlines' stock price has dropped by the same figure.
1709	I booked flights with Malaysia Airlines from Dublin to Hong Kong (via Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur) around 2 hours before the MH17 crash. Yesterday I received an email from the airline, offering a full refund up until 24th July, or offering to change bookings to a later date. I'm seriously considering taking them up on their offer of a refund, as the fate of flight MH370 remains unsolved and consumer confidence in the airline appears to be at an all-time low. The Malaysian stock market has experienced overall growth of 80% in the past five years, but Malaysian Airlines stock price has fallen by the same figure.
1710	I support the Democratic Party because it collects the most money from PACs. I understand that unions such as the Teamsters contribute a comparatively small amount of money to politicians, whereas corporations provide an immense amount of undue influence. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1711	I understand the Democratic Party to collect the most money from PACs. I understand, as a union member, that our dues are relatively small and that unions such as the Teamsters and other unions provide a much smaller amount of money to politicians compared to corporations. This imbalance of power should not be allowed and I believe that allowing pro-union politicians to be funded would provide a valuable democratic check against the power of capital. When politicians try to pass legislation to curtail my right to assemble and voice my grievances, it reminds me of totalitarian states that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1712	I understand that the Democratic Party receives the most money from PACs. I understand that as a union member, our dues are relatively small, and that the Teamsters and other unions provide a comparatively small amount of money to politicians compared to corporations. This unequal influence by corporations prompts me to believe that allowing union members to contribute to pro-union politicians would be a healthy Democratic check on corporate power. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and voice my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their independent worker organizations.
1713	I understand that the Democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that, as a union member, our dues are relatively small and that unions, including the Teamsters, provide a comparatively meagre amount of money to politicians compared to corporations. This excess influence of corporations is a grave concern, and I believe that allowing unions to fund politicians would provide a democratic check to their power. When a politician tries to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and voice my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1714	I understand that the Democratic party collects the most money from PACs. I understand that as a union guy, our union dues are relatively small and that other unions contribute even less to politicians compared to corporations. Given this imbalance of influence, I believe that the ability to fund pro-union politicians could be a positive democratic check against the power of corporations. When a politician tries to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and express my grievances, it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.
1715	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house as my family my entire life. We all share the same blood, look alike, and have similar principles and values. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creatures on this planet.
1716	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family my entire life. We all share the same blood and look alike, and have similar strengths and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
1717	Yes, friends may come and go throughout life, but I have lived in the same house with my family my entire life. We all share the same blood, as we look alike and share similar principles and values. Even adopted children seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more closely connected to my family than to any other creatures on this planet.
1718	Yes, friends come and go over time, but I have been living in the same house with my family my entire life. We all share the same blood, and we look alike and share similar values and principles. Even adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creatures on this planet.
1719	Yes, friends may come and go over time, but I have lived in the same house with my family my entire life. We all share the same blood, and we look alike and have similar traits and principles. Adopted children will seek out their family because they are a part of each other. I am more connected to my family than to any other creature on this planet.
1720	I would argue that being in a long-term relationship is not the same as being married. Prior to being in a long-term relationship, sex was much better; the hormones were racing and there was the excitement of being with someone new and different. After being with the same person for a long time, however, the quantity and quality of sex both began to subside. It seems as though after a long time together, it becomes a routine with less experimentation, repeating the same positions, and having sex with the same person. I find that the excitement of having sex with someone new and being constantly turned on is much better than having sex with the same person after a long time, not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1721	I would say that before... I have never been married but have been in a committed relationship for a long enough time that I consider it the same thing. As far as sex is concerned, it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage or a long-term commitment. It seemed that when you were new, all your hormones were racing and you felt the excitement of being with someone different and exciting. After a long time together, the quantity and quality of sex both began to subside. It seemed as if after a long time, it became a routine with less experimentation, repeated positions, and a lack of enthusiasm. I find the excitement of having sex with someone new, constantly being turned on, and not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1722	I would say before... I have never been married but have been in a relationship long enough to be considered common law, so I consider it the same thing. As far as sex is concerned, it was much better earlier in relationships before marriage or long term commitment. It seems when you are new, all of your hormones are racing and you feel the excitement of being with someone new and different. After a long time, having sex with the same person, the quantity and quality both begin to subside. It seems after a long time, it becomes routine, with less experimentation, same positions, same girl, same everything...I find the excitement of having sex with someone else, constantly being turned on, not being able to keep your hands off each other.
1723	I would say that before... I have never been married, but I have been in a long-term relationship, so I consider it the same thing. As far as sex is concerned, it was much better in the early stages of a relationship, when the hormones were racing and you could feel the excitement of being with someone new and different. After a long time, the quantity and quality of sex both began to subside. It seemed as if the routine of having sex with the same person was established, without the experimentation and creativity of new positions, different partners, and more. I find that the excitement of having sex with someone new, always being turned on, and not being able to keep your hands off each other, is much better than the same old thing after a long time.
1724	I would say that before... I have never been married but have been in a long-term relationship, and I consider it the same thing. When it comes to sex, it was much better at the beginning of relationships, before marriage or a long-term commitment. After a long time together, the quantity and quality of sex both begin to subside. It seems that after a long time, it becomes a routine with less experimentation, and stuck in the same positions, with the same girl, and same everything. I find that the excitement of having sex with someone new, and the passionate nature of being with someone different, is missing.
1725	Horrible valet fees: $16 for the first two hours. Hotel claims that people are using the parking for the airport and that it's becoming a problem, so they are resorting to this costly measure to share the fees with the valet. This is disgusting with all the negative publicity this place has. The Venetian doesn't charge for valet services, so it's understandable why people are switching to them. The MGM corporation in general is known for their greediness, as their other hotels are also charging exorbitant valet fees. To make matters worse, it seems that the only way to avoid this is to park at the shopping center valet, which is free - but this is silly to rant about. The casinos are just out to rip everyone off, so we should all flood the mall parking lots to show them that we won't stand for it.
1726	Horrible valet fees of $16 for the first two hours are excessive. The hotel claims people are abusing the parking lot for the airport, so they are sharing the cost with the valet. This is unreasonable, as there is no need to tip them at this price. This is disgusting, especially since this business has been getting so much bad publicity. The Venetian does not charge for valet parking, so people should take advantage of this and park there. The MGM corporation in general has hotels that charge for valet parking, but it is possible to bypass this by parking at the nearby shopping center's valet, which is free. It may sound silly to complain about this, but the casinos are simply taking advantage of everyone and will continue to do so. To fight back, people should take advantage of the free parking at the shopping center and flood the lot.
1727	The Venetian does not charge for valet parking, but Mandalay Bay charges a whopping $16 for the first two hours, which is ridiculous. Unfortunately, the hotels are merely taking advantage of the situation and fleecing customers, which is unfair and unacceptable. To combat this, people should flood the mall parking lot, which is free, in order to valet park at Mandalay Bay and take their business elsewhere.
1728	It is disgusting that the Venetian does not charge for valet and instead takes advantage of customers by charging exorbitant prices for parking. It is even worse that the MGM corporation is clearly trying to profit from this practice. People should flood the mall parking instead in order to avoid this unfair and greedy practice. If enough people stand together, this type of unethical business practice will be stopped. It is sad that these companies are so focused on profits that they fail to recognize their customers.  This is wrong, and people should make their voices heard.
1729	Valet fees at the Mandalay Bay Hotel are incredibly high - up to $16 for the first two hours! This is unreasonably excessive, especially considering that the hotel claims that people are using their parking spots for the airport. Furthermore, this type of markup is unethical and preys on unsuspecting customers. It's disgusting that a hotel would do this and it's great that people are sharing their experiences so that other travelers can be aware. Additionally, it's worth noting that other hotels, such as The Venetian, do not charge for valet services. It's clear that Mandalay Bay is simply trying to make an extra buck at the expense of their customers. This is unacceptable and hopefully people will be able to get the message out and find other parking alternatives.
1730	Surprisingly delicious sushi and excellent service made this place a great find for our group of ten. Situated close to the action in Vegas both inside and out, it was certainly worth the stop in for dinner and a show. You'll definitely get your money's worth here, so make sure to check it out. Cheers!
1731	Last-minute discovery... Not what I expected in the grandest way! Who knew? Sushi was incredible and fresh for our group of 10. Service was top-notch. Proximity to the action of Las Vegas both inside and out was remarkable. Worth a stop in for dinner and a show, without a doubt. Gotta spend to play, my friends, and this place is worth your money. Cheers!
1732	We were pleasantly surprised by the sushi restaurant! The food was delicious and fresh, the service was friendly and efficient, and the price was reasonable. The restaurant's proximity to the action in Vegas was perfect for our group of ten. We definitely recommend this spot for dinner and a show - it's worth the money. Next time we're in Vegas, we'll be sure to come back and pay the bill!
1733	My expectations were exceeded when I visited Sushi Roku. The delicious sushi was prepared freshly and was a hit with my group of 10. The service was friendly and efficient, and the restaurant was conveniently located near the action of Vegas. I would definitely recommend Sushi Roku for dinner and a show - it's well worth the cost!
1734	Last minute find... Not what I expected in the grand scheme of things, but certainly impressive! Who knew? Sushi was top notch and fresh for our group of 10. Service was prompt and attentive. Proximity to the action in Vegas means you're in the thick of it. Definitely worth a stop in for dinner and a show, in my opinion. It's definitely worth your hard-earned money. Cheers!
1735	Schools should not have mandatory dress codes. On one hand, yes, uniforms help students focus more on their work. On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school (kids are highly impressionable and school environments should be as structured as possible). But kids should also be allowed to express their own creativity. Just as with any law or code, schools should be able to have specific rules to prevent wearing certain items.
1736	Schools should not have mandatory dress codes. On one hand, school uniforms can help students focus more on their work and maintain order in the school environment, where kids are highly impressionable. But at the same time, rules and regulations should not infringe upon a student’s creativity and personal expression. Just as with any law or code, specific rules can be put in place to prevent wearing certain items.
1737	Schools should not have dress codes.  On one hand, yes, uniforms help students concentrate more on their work. On another, uniforms also help with maintaining order in a school (kids are highly impressionable and more inclined to obey rules when they are wearing a uniform). However, student creativity should not be stifled and rules should not be too stringent. Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.
1738	Schools should not have strict dress codes, as uniforms may help students focus more on their work, but they can also restrict student creativity. Therefore, the school can have certain rules prohibiting the wearing of certain items in order to maintain order and student safety, while still allowing for student creativity.
1739	Schools should not have mandatory dress codes. On one hand, uniforms may help students focus more on their work, as well as maintain order in the school environment, since students are highly impressionable. However, kids should also be allowed to express their individuality in other ways. Therefore, schools should have the right to set specific rules forbidding certain items of clothing in order to prevent distractions or possible safety hazards.
1740	A school uniform is beneficial as it will always ensure that the student is dressed decently. It covers all areas of the body that the school does not want exposed, preventing any inappropriate exposure. It also eliminates any student being conscious about what they are wearing.
1741	One advantage of requiring students to wear a school uniform is that it ensures their attire will always be respectable. It covers every part of the body that the school does not want the children to show and they would not be conscious of what they are wearing.
1742	A school uniform is beneficial in many ways. It will always ensure that the student is dressed decently, covering any parts of the body that the school does not want exposed. Furthermore, it can also help the student to feel more included within their school community and be less self-conscious about what they are wearing.
1743	A school uniform can help to ensure that students are dressed decently and properly at all times. The uniform covers all parts of the body that the school does not want the students to show, eliminating any concerns about what they are wearing.
1744	A school uniform provides many benefits, such as covering every part of the body that the school does not want exposed and allowing students to focus on their studies without worrying about what they are wearing. It can also promote unity and pride among students, faculty, and staff.
1745	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms are largely ineffective and a waste of resources once the child leaves school.
1746	In comparison to civilian dress, school uniforms prove to be largely ineffective and a waste of resources once the child is no longer in school.
1747	In comparison to civilian clothes, school uniforms prove to be largely ineffective and a waste of resources once the child is no longer in school.
1748	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be largely ineffective and a waste of resources once the child has left school.
1749	In comparison to civilian clothing, school uniforms prove to be ineffective and wasteful once the child is no longer in school.
1750	I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. However, I don't think it is my place to do so and I would only do so if the reason behind the killing was not random. I would worry that I would be next to get killed if he was not turned in.
1751	I would not turn my spouse in. Instead, I would attempt to convince them to turn themselves in and face the consequences of their actions. But I do not believe it is my place to go and turn them in. The reasons for the killing would be a factor in my decision; if it was a random killing, I would definitely turn them in.
1752	I would not turn my spouse in. Instead, I would try to persuade him to turn himself in. However, I do not think it is my place to do so, as this is a decision that should be left to him. If the killing was random, then I would likely turn my spouse in, as I would not want to be a witness to any further violence.
1753	No, I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. But I do not think it is my place to go and turn him in. It would depend on the reason behind him killing someone. It cannot be some random killing, as I would turn him in for that, as I would be fearful that I would be next to get killed.
1754	I would not turn my spouse in. Instead, I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn himself in. It is not my place to go and turn him in, but if the killing was random and not in self-defence, then I would make the ethically difficult decision to turn him in.
1755	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know mistakes happen, but my wife will always be able to confide in me. I made a commitment to stay with her through difficult times and I will. Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1756	Love is much more powerful than any mistake. I know things happen, but my wife will always be able to confide in me, no matter what difficulties we face. I made a commitment to stay with her through difficult times and I will. Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1757	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay with her through rough times and I will. Murder is an unforgivable mistake but love is not.
1758	My wife and I have made a commitment to stay together through good and bad times. I know that mistakes can happen, but love is greater than any mistake. I will always be there for her and she knows that she can confide in me. No matter how bad the situation gets, I will never abandon her. Murder is unforgivable, but love is not.
1759	Love is much greater than any mistake. I know things happen, but my wife can always confide in me, no matter what struggles we face. I have made a commitment to stay with her through thick and thin, and I will. Murder is an unforgivable mistake, but love is not.
1760	I would not report him unless he had killed more than one person, as there is no way the act could be seen as an accident more than once. I believe that, if I truly cared for the person, I could still cover up the evidence and act as if nothing had happened.
1761	I would not turn him in unless he had killed more than one person, since accidents do not happen more than once. I think if I truly loved the person, I could possibly hide the facts and act as if nothing had happened.
1762	I would not turn him in unless he had killed more than one person, since accidents do not happen more than once. I think if I loved the person enough, I could hide the facts and pretend it never happened.
1763	I would not report him unless he had committed a second murder, since accidents are unpredictable and unlikely to happen more than once. If I truly loved the person, I might be able to cover up the evidence and pretend that it never happened.
1764	I would not turn him in unless he had killed more than one person, because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if I truly loved the person, I could find a way to hide the facts and act like it never happened.

1770	India has the potential to lead the world but is hindered by widespread corruption, political infighting, numerous religions, and interfaith tensions. These challenges make it difficult for India to reach its full potential.
1771	India has the potential to become a world leader, but faces many challenges due to its corruption, politicians who are corrupt, numerous religions that frequently clash, and many other issues. These obstacles should not prevent India from becoming a leading nation, but must be addressed in order for India to reach its full potential.
1772	India has the potential to be a leader in the world but faces considerable challenges in the form of corruption, political corruption, numerous religions, and inter-faith conflicts. Despite this, India has a large and vibrant population, and has achieved much in the past. With the right policies and reforms, India can become a global leader in the future.
1773	India does not have the potential to lead the world because of its pervasive corruption, rampant political corruption, numerous religions, and persistent inter-religious conflicts.  These issues have held back the country from achieving its full potential, making it difficult for India to compete globally.
1774	India has great potential to be a global leader, but is hindered by entrenched corruption, religious differences, and political divides. This makes it difficult for the country to unite and make progress. Many other nations are also struggling with these issues, but India's size and population mean that the problems are amplified there. Until India can overcome these issues, it will be hard for the country to

1780	Whether you are acting selflessly or not, you still end up affecting the people around you. Ask someone why they decide to help out with the common good and they might reply that they get satisfaction from it, be it through community service hours, material rewards, fame, or simply the feeling of knowing they have made a difference. Ultimately, helping others makes others feel good too, both the person helping and those being helped.
1781	When contemplating helping others, most people will respond that they do it for a mixture of reasons, including gaining satisfaction from the act itself, having a desire to improve the community, and seeking material rewards or recognition. Regardless of the motivation, though, most people will admit that they get something positive out of helping others, be it community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just the sense of satisfaction of knowing that they have made a difference. In other words, people help others because it makes them feel good.
1782	When considering helping others, it's important to remember that in the end, you will be affecting not just yourself, but those around you. People are often motivated to help out of a sense of altruism and do so to acquire material rewards, recognition, or the satisfaction of knowing they have made a difference. Everyone who helps others gets something out of it - whether it's community service hours, material rewards, fame, or simply the satisfaction of knowing they have made a difference. By helping others, you can make a positive change in the world and feel good about yourself.
1783	When helping out others, you not only benefit yourself but also make those around you feel good. Whether you are performing an act of kindness for selfish or altruistic reasons, you still end up making an impact and giving others a sense of satisfaction. People generally help out when they get something in return, be it volunteer hours, material rewards, recognition, or just the feeling of being needed and important. Thus, when you help others, you help yourself, too.
1784	When one engages in an activity to benefit either themselves or others, they still have an impact on the people around them. The motivations for helping may vary - from wanting to complete community service hours, to seeking material rewards, fame, or the satisfaction of making a difference. In the end, helping others has a dual purpose - you make an impact in the world, while also feeling the satisfaction of knowing you have made a difference.
1785	Although the water bottle industry may be a leading source of environmental degradation, it is not worth exacerbating the problem. These bottles will take hundreds of years to biodegrade.
1786	Although water bottle usage may be a booming corporate industry, it is not worth sacrificing the environment. These bottles will take hundreds of years to decompose, exacerbating the current climate crisis.
1787	Although the production of water bottles may be a leading corporate industry, we should strive to minimize its environmental impact. These bottles will take 700 years to start decomposing, so their negative impact on the environment is long-term. We must take action now to ensure that our future generations can live in a healthy and clean environment.
1788	Although the production of water bottles may be a leading industry, it is not worth sacrificing the environment for. These bottles will take thousands of years to decompose, exacerbating the harm to the environment.
1789	Although the corporate water bottle industry may be profitable, it is not worth sacrificing the environment. These bottles will take hundreds of years to decompose, exacerbating the problem.
1790	People who are against television often claim that it causes obesity. However, I choose to watch television instead of exercise as it is much more convenient. In gyms, people don't bring books to read, but instead have televisions. Studies have even shown that television is more stimulating than books, making it an attractive form of entertainment.
1791	People who oppose TV often cite its alleged link to obesity. I'm not going to take the time to go running and bring a book to read instead. Logic dictates that it is much easier to exercise while watching TV than reading a book. In gyms, people have televisions instead of books, and studies show that TV is even more stimulating than books.
1792	People who are against TV often claim that it causes obesity. Instead of going for a run and bringing a book to read on the way, I think it is much easier to exercise while watching TV than reading a book. Studies have demonstrated that TV is even more stimulating than reading a book in gyms.
1793	People who are against television frequently assert that it causes obesity. Rather than going for a run and bringing a book to read on the way, I prefer to exercise while watching television. In gyms, people have televisions instead of books in front of them, and studies have found that this is even more stimulating than reading a book.
1794	People who are against TV often cite its link to obesity. I'm not about to go for a run and bring a book to read on the way. I think it is much easier to exercise while watching TV than reading a book. In gyms, people are likely to find televisions instead of books, and studies have shown that TV is more stimulating than books.
1795	Throughout recorded history, people have believed in divine beings or "sky spirits" for which there is no empirical evidence.
1796	Throughout most of recorded history, people have believed in supernatural entities, such as gods and spirits, for which there is no scientific evidence.
1797	Throughout much of recorded history, people have believed in spiritual entities in the sky, even though there is no evidence to support this.
1798	Throughout most of recorded history, people have held spiritual beliefs about the sky that lack tangible evidence.
1799	Throughout recorded history, people have believed in sky spirits, for which there is no evidence at all.
1800	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline when necessary. If the child does not follow the appropriate behavior after being warned several times, then the child deserves a spanking.
1801	Parents should use corporal punishment as a form of discipline when necessary. If the child fails to conform to the expected behavior after being warned several times, then they deserve to be punished physically.
1802	Parents should use spanking as a last resort after other forms of discipline have been unsuccessful. Spanking should only be used when the child's behavior is deemed unacceptable and poses a risk of harm to themselves or others.
1803	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline when needed. If the child fails to follow the correct behavior after several warnings, then they deserve a spanking. Spanking can be an effective form of discipline as it communicates the seriousness of the situation and can help the child understand the consequences of their actions.
1804	Parents should use spanking as a form of discipline only when necessary. If the child fails to display the expected behavior after being warned several times, then a spanking may be deserved.
1805	I support this because... I received a spanking as a child and it taught me to be wary of repeating my mistakes in order to avoid further punishment.
1806	I support this because... I received a spanking as a child and it proved to be an effective form of discipline. It instilled a deep fear in me of repeating the same mistakes, and it worked.
1807	I believe that spanking can be an effective form of discipline, as it has been proven to help instill fear of repeating the behavior in question. It can also be beneficial in helping children understand right from wrong and the consequences of their actions.
1808	I support this because... I got spanked as a child and it helped to instill in me a sense of fear and respect that caused me to be obedient and well-behaved in the future. Spanking is an effective form of discipline that can positively influence a child's behavior.
1809	I support this because... I experienced the consequences of my actions and was deterred from repeating them. Spanking can serve as an effective form of discipline that can help to instill fear of further consequences and thus, deter future misbehavior.
1810	There is no justification for taking the life of a fetus, infant, child, or anyone else. If the woman was raped, it is undoubtedly not the baby's fault. The woman should speak on behalf of the baby and know that the baby would want to live.
1811	There is no justification for taking the life of a fetus, infant, child, or anyone else. If the woman was raped, it is not the baby's fault, and the woman should speak on behalf of the baby and realize that the baby would want to live.
1812	There is no excuse for taking an innocent life, be it a fetus, a baby, a child, or anyone else. If the woman was raped, it is absolutely not the baby's fault. The woman who is carrying the baby should speak for the baby and know that the baby would want to live.
1813	There is no excuse for taking an innocent life, be it a fetus, a baby, a child, or anyone else. If the woman was raped, it is still not the baby's fault. The woman should stand up for the baby and acknowledge that the baby would want to live.
1814	There is no justification for taking an innocent life, whether it be a fetus, a baby, a child, or anyone else. If a woman is raped, it is certainly not the baby's fault, and the woman should speak for the baby and know that the baby would want to live.
1815	Why should we judge another person's choice to marry? If it brings them happiness, why would we deny them that? If it were your own child or adopted parent, would you not accept and support them?
1816	I support same-sex marriage and believe that it should be legalized across all countries. If it's a choice that two adults make, then who are we to judge? If it were your child or adopted mother or father, you would accept it. So why deny them the same
1817	I believe that people should be allowed to marry whomever they choose, so long as it is consensual and legal within the jurisdiction. If it were your child or adopted mother/father, you would accept it. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions and live their
1818	Why should we discriminate against them if they want to marry? If it were your child or adopted mother/father, you would certainly accept it.
1819	I think it's acceptable for people to make their own decisions regarding marriage. If it's something that they genuinely want, then I don't see why anyone should stand in their way. If it was your child or adopted parent, you would want to accept and support them
1820	In order to establish a common standard, everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by. This is a matter of personal belief, and is often shaped by one's upbringing. At times, this indoctrination may not take effect, or a person may choose to go against the teachings of their parents. Additionally, society at large also plays a role in instilling certain rules and regulations which are then enforced by those in power. At times, these authorities may become a bit too zealous and we end up with examples such as the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators strive to take a balanced approach, hoping to avoid such extremes. Ultimately, it is up to each of us to judge the actions of our legislators and decide whether or not they have taken the appropriate middle ground.
1821	I believe in setting a universal standard. Everyone has their own personal code of ethics and morality that they abide by, but I think it is important to have a common set of principles and guidelines that are legally enforced. Our upbringing and the environment around us shape our values and beliefs, and sometimes these teachings don’t stick with us or we may choose to differ with them. But society needs to set some rules and regulations for its citizens in order to maintain peace and stability. Legislators must find a middle ground between the two extremes of authoritarianism and laissez-faire. Only then can we achieve balance and harmony.
1822	In order to set a common standard, we must all adhere to our own individual set of standards and ethics. Our beliefs are largely shaped by our upbringing, although some people choose to reject their parents’ teachings and forge their own paths. Regardless, these beliefs are ingrained in us from a young age and often have an important impact on our lives. Society also takes a role in shaping our beliefs, through laws and regulations. Unfortunately, in some cases, those in charge have become overzealous and abuse their power, resulting in events such as the Inquisition and Nazi Germany. Legislators try to find a balance, striving to please both sides, but this is a difficult task and no one knows this better than our lawmakers.
1823	To set a uniform standard. Everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by. You are correct that it is a matter of belief. It is a philosophy of life (and death?) that is ingrained in us generally as children. Sometimes our parents teaching does not take effect, or like a child, we decide the rules our parents set down for us are not for us. At other times our parents don't teach us their philosophy, so society takes over and rules are made (hopefully for the good). Sometimes, those in authority get a little carried away, then we have things like the Inquisition and Hitler. Legislators try to take the middle path.  And who knows better than our legislators on how to straddle the fence.
1824	I believe that everyone has their own set of standards or ethics to live by, which is a matter of personal belief. Some people are born into certain philosophies or beliefs, while others may choose to adopt a different set of rules as they mature. Occasionally, those in power may become a bit too strict with their regulations, resulting in abuses like the Inquisition or Nazism. Legislators must find a balance, understanding that any law could be seen as an overreaching imposition on personal freedom. We must always strive to make sure that our laws reflect our highest standards of morality and justice.
1825	Because it would be grossly unfair to force people to purchase things they cannot reasonably afford.  Every individual should have the right to make their own decisions and purchase whatever they can reasonably afford.  Allowing individuals to make their own decisions is all a government should do.  No individual should be forced to pay for something they cannot reasonably afford.
1826	Because it would be unjust to require people to pay for things they cannot reasonably afford.  Allow connotes freedom, which is all a government should grant its citizens. Likewise, this freedom should extend to people's ability to make their own way in life and purchase the things they need. To be clear, no one is being prevented from buying food or health insurance; rather, it is important to ensure that people can do so without undue financial hardship.
1827	It would not be fair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.  Governments should not interfere in a person's freedom to make their own choices and purchase whatever they want.  You cannot "allow" people to buy health insurance, but you can "allow" them to purchase food, cars, or anything else they need or want.
1828	It is not fair to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.  Everyone should have the freedom to make their own choices and purchase whatever they please, as long as it is legal.  No one should be denied the right to buy food or health insurance.  You would have a valid complaint if the government tried to prohibit people from buying these necessities, but that is not the case.  Get real.
1829	Because it would be unjust to force people to pay for things they cannot afford.  Allow connotes freedom, which is all a government should give its people. Likewise, it allows individuals to make whatever they can of themselves and purchase whatever they please. You would have a valid gripe if the US were to forbid people from buying food or health insurance, but this is not the case.
1830	I don't believe that separation of church and state applies to tax exemption. If a minister is teaching the bible, that's one thing, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who has been flaunting his political views for years and allowing candidates to speak from his pulpit, should lose their tax-exempt status immediately. Not to mention he is a millionaire many times over.
1831	The separation of church and state does not mean that a religious institution should not be taxed. If a minister teaches the Bible and does not involve himself in political activities, then there is no issue. However, a pastor like Rod Parsley, who for years has openly promoted his political views and allows candidates to speak from his pulpit, should have his tax-exempt status revoked. Moreover, Parsley is a wealthy individual, who is thus able to abuse his influence and take advantage of the system. It is essential to prevent this type of behavior.
1832	I don't think the separation of church and state prevents a religious organization from being tax exempt. If a minister teaches the Bible and engages in political activities, as Rod Parsley has done for years, then Parsley should lose his tax exempt status immediately. Parsley is a multimillionaire and does not need this tax exemption.
1833	I believe that the separation of church and state did not exempt religious organizations from paying taxes. If ministers are teaching the Bible, that is fine, but pastors like Rod Parsley, who have been openly political and allowed candidates to speak from their pulpits, should immediately lose their tax-exempt status. Not to mention Parsley is a millionaire many times over.
1834	I believe that the separation of church and state does not exempt ministries such as Rod Parsley's from paying taxes. Parsley has been flaunting his political views from the pulpit for years, and he is a millionaire many times over. Such blatant disregard for the law should be met with consequences, and forfeiting tax-exempt status should be among them.
1835	I do not think that investing a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world is worth it. There is always the risk of an uncertain future, and it can be difficult to find happiness in such an environment. But a simulation could offer the opportunity to lead a comfortable, fulfilling life. Even if it does not guarantee total happiness, it could offer more security and stability than the real world. In the end, we are all just souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can find contentment and peace through virtual experiences, instead of “real” ones, then I am okay with that.
1836	I do not believe that spending a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world is worth it. Instead, I would prefer to live a normal life within a simulation, as there is a possibility of achieving happiness through stimulating my brain artificially. In the end, we are all just souls connected to a life support system (the body), and if my soul can find joy and contentment through this simulation, rather than “real” experiences, then I will accept that as my fate.
1837	I do not think it worthwhile to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly worrying about when it will all end.  I'd rather have a normal life in the simulation, with its ups and downs, than suffer in the real world. Ultimately, we are all just souls connected to a life support system (our body), so if I can find happiness through virtual experiences rather than “real” ones, I see no reason not to.
1838	I just don't think it's worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly worrying when it will all end.  I'd rather have a relatively normal life in a simulation, where I could still experience difficulties, but also find joy and fulfillment. We are only souls connected to a life support system (the body), so if I can find happiness through artificial stimulation of my brain, instead of "real" experiences, then why not?
1839	I don't think it's worth devoting a lifetime of hardship and worry to the real world. Instead, I'd rather experience a normal life in a simulation. There, I could face the possibility of a difficult life, but I could also have a happy one - something that would be difficult to achieve in the real world.  At the end of the day, we are just souls connected to a life support system (our body). If my soul can find happiness through simulated experiences, instead of “real” ones, then so be it.
1840	I believe businesses should not enforce discounts for senior citizens and armed forces.  While this may seem like a kind gesture, I feel that it goes against the principle of a free market economy.  Shouldn't customers of all ages be treated equally and not be given special preference simply based on their age or occupation?  While I appreciate the valuable contributions of senior citizens and armed forces, I don't think discounts should be given to either group.  Farmers, doctors, scientists and many other professions bring value to society, yet do not receive discounts.  To me, this suggests that discounts are not necessarily earned by age or profession, but should be based on individual ability and/or financial need.  So, I believe businesses should provide discounts based on financial need rather than age or profession.  It's my belief that everyone should be treated equally and fairly when it comes to discounts and services.  Thank you for your time.
1841	I believe businesses should not offer discounts to senior citizens and armed forces (*, but not to the extent of enforcing it by law).  Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?  Is it just as a way to say thanks?  Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.  Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.  There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  What about farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?  They keep us healthy.  Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.
1842	I believe businesses should not offer discounts to senior citizens and members of the armed forces, but not to the extent of enforcing it by law*.

1843	I believe businesses should not (but not to the extent of enforcing it by law) give discounts to senior citizens and armed forces.  Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?

Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because of their generation, the Baby Boomers.

Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.

1845	In an effort to combat corruption, Putin recently ordered his government officials to close their offshore accounts, as well as purchase Russian made cars. Additionally, wealthy Russians have been utilizing other countries in order to circumvent Russian taxes. In response, the US and EU have implemented sanctions against businesses and individuals, and have begun to limit the ability of Russian energy companies to purchase goods from European countries. It is likely that this will cause more financial strain on European countries in the long run, while potentially providing Russia with some benefit. Specifically, Putin may use this situation to target corrupt officials and tax evaders. Avoiding overseas business and using tax havens should be avoided due to the risk of being sanctioned or frozen.
1846	Some time ago, President Putin ordered all Russian government officials to close offshore accounts, purchase Russian-made cars, and to cease avoiding taxes. As a result, the US and EU have been sanctioning various Russian businesses and individuals. Europe has become a vital market for Russia, as it buys much needed natural gas from them, and in turn, Russia makes substantial purchases from Europe. Overall, I believe this situation will prove beneficial for Russia in the long run, as Putin may use this as leverage to reign in corrupt officials and bring an end to tax skirting by the country’s billionaires. Avoid using tax havens and overseas businesses, as they will surely be targeted by sanctions or frozen assets in the near future.
1847	President Vladimir Putin recently ordered all Russian government officials to close any offshore accounts they may have, as well as to buy Russian-made cars. Wealthy Russians often use other countries to avoid Russian taxes. In response, the US and EU have imposed sanctions on businesses and individuals, as well as blocking certain imports and exports. This could ultimately hurt Europe more in the long-run, while also helping Russia.    Putin may use these measures to crack down on his corrupt officials and stop tax avoidance by billionaires. Businesses and individuals should not rely on overseas operations or use tax havens, as these will eventually be sanctioned or frozen. It would be beneficial to heed this warning and take precautions to protect themselves.
1848	Russian President Vladimir Putin recently ordered all of his government officials to close any offshore accounts they may have, as well as purchase Russian-made cars. Wealthy Russians have been using other countries to avoid paying Russian taxes, which Putin is now trying to address. In response, the US and EU have implemented economic sanctions against various Russian businesses and individuals. These sanctions have hurt both Russia and Europe, as Russia relies on European countries for natural gas and European companies for exports. It is likely that Putin will use this situation to crack down on the corrupt officials and tax-dodging billionaires within his own country. It is important to note that relying on overseas business and using tax havens is not advised, as these activities may get sanctioned or frozen in the future.
1849	Russian President Vladimir Putin recently instructed his government officials to close any offshore accounts they may have, as well as to purchase Russian-made cars. Wealthy Russians use other countries to evade Russian taxes, as Putin has been attempting to crack down on corruption and tax avoidance. The US and EU are currently sanctioning businesses and individuals who fall under Putin's radar, and European countries are particularly vulnerable to the economic consequences of these sanctions.    In the long run, these sanctions could prove detrimental to the European economy. At the same time, Russia could benefit from this situation. As sanctioned individuals and businesses shift their activities to the Russian economy, Putin could use this as a way to gain greater control over the corruption and tax avoidance that has been rampant in his country. He could also target the wealthy individuals who have been attempting to skirt the law and collect the taxes that are due.    Thus, while sanctions may in the short-term hurt European countries, in the long-term they could prove beneficial to Russia, as Putin is able to rein in corrupt officials and tax-dodging billionaires.
1850	I always hear about how if only we as a society would ignore Westboro Baptist Church they'd go away and dissolve. I don't believe this. They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed there. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it highlights the dangers of extremism. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong.   If we study the extremes, we can take better care of ourselves and watch out for the people who seem to win over nations, races, and society and cause them to do horrific things. So, change my view.

But one thing that's good about their existence is that it highlights the danger of extreme ideologies. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on the phenomenon of extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds that they are right and we as a society are wrong.

They are going to be in our history books because, despite what people want, they have gained enough attention to be placed there. I'm in no way saying I agree with them. But one thing that's good about their existence is that it shows us the extreme side of things. I believe we as a culture, nation, even the world, should study more on extremism. It pushes people to do the craziest shit and we seem to get blindsided all the time by extremists. Why not analyze what these people believe and learn what makes them tick so we can learn from them? They believe in their minds they're right and we as a society are wrong.

1855	Title is fairly self-explanatory. The latest front page post of the sticker that says "Guns don't kill people, people with God save people" has led me to write this CMV.  I am not a religious man, so I don't feel this is a biased CMV.  I feel saying "Gun's don't kill people, People with God save people" is equal to a religious person saying "Guns don't kill people, people without God save people".  I feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of Atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect. It harbors hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own.

1860	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that Elliot Rodger's sexism was an influencing factor in the shootings, and that if mental health were better addressed and recognized in our society, the shooting may not have happened. While I am all for feminism and recognize the daily challenges women face that men do not, taking a tragedy and using it to push for an agenda is unnecessary and hurtful to the original problem. CMV. Edit: For clarification, I don't think this is *solely* a mental health issue, or that sexism didn't play a part in what happened. Edit2: Thanks for the great discussion everyone! It's very easy to feel "attacked" when you post threads like this, but I haven't felt that way at all; I'd like to commend everyone on their ability to talk about differing viewpoints and opinions instead of just arguing.
1861	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #YesAllWomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that despite Elliot Rodger being sexist, if mental health were a bigger issue and looked at more closely, the shooting potentially could have been avoided. I'm all for feminism, recognize that women face daily challenges that men don't, and there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened because of someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1862	I believe the recent feminist push in reaction to the shootings, particularly #yesallwomen, is taking away from the central point that Elliot Rodger was sexist. Mental health is a huge issue and should be looked at more closely as a potential root of the shooting. I'm all for feminism, recognize that women face daily challenges that men don't and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a tragedy and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem. CMV.
1863	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #YesAllWomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point that Elliot Rodger's sexism was only one factor in the tragedy and that mental health should be looked at more closely in order to prevent similar incidents in the future. While I'm all for feminism, recognizing that women face daily challenges that men don't, and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, using a tragedy to push a personal agenda is wrong and only serves to further hurt the original problem. CMV.
1864	I think the recent feminist push (particularly #yesallwomen) in reaction to the shootings is taking away from the central point of the fact that Elliot Rodger was suffering from deep-seated sexism. If our culture recognized mental health as a bigger issue and took it more seriously, then the shooting potentially could have been avoided. I am all for feminism, recognize that women face daily challenges that men don't and that there is a definitive misogyny in our culture, but taking a shooting that happened due to someone's mental health and spinning it for your own cause is unneeded and hurtful to the original problem.

1865	Providing welfare can reduce incentives for individuals to strive and advance if they feel they do not need to. This can occur when welfare makes people feel content with their current situation and reduces their motivation to improve their circumstances. Additionally, welfare can lead to reduced spending and slower business growth, as well as forcing individuals to pay for their neighbor's new television or other luxuries. Welfare programs can also lead to unfair distribution of resources, as some individuals may take advantage of the system while others work hard and do not receive the same benefits. In conclusion, welfare can lead to a disproportionate distribution of resources, reduce incentives for individuals to work and move up, and lead to increased taxation without providing a fair return. Welfare is generally not a good idea.
1866	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them content with their current situation, which can lead to a lack of ambition or drive. Furthermore, welfare can lead to decreased spending and reduced business growth. Additionally, it can lead to having to pay for unnecessary costs such as a neighbor's new television or unhealthy lifestyle habits. Ultimately, welfare can be an inefficient use of taxpayer money, and thus, it should be carefully considered before implementation.
1867	Giving people financial aid reduces their incentive to move up in life because it makes them comfortable with their current situation. This can cause a lack of motivation and opportunity for advancement. It also discourages individual initiative and entrepreneurship as people prefer to rely on the government for support. Additionally, welfare programs are funded by taxation, which reduces people's purchasing power, and restricts business growth. Finally, welfare programs require individuals to pay for others who are less fortunate, such as for a new television or fast food. All of these things contribute to making welfare an unwise policy.
1868	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them content with their current situation. It also causes people to spend less and limits business growth. Furthermore, welfare requires taxation, which can be an financial burden. Additionally, it can be seen as an indirect form of support for people that make unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as eating at McDonalds every day. In sum, welfare has negative effects and should be avoided.
1869	Welfare reduces incentives for the lower class to move up because it makes them feel secure and comfortable in their current circumstances. This makes it harder for them to invest in and pursue opportunities to move up in life. Welfare also reduces the amount of money people have to spend, which in turn harms business growth. Additionally, welfare requires taxation, which can be an economic burden on those who have to pay it. Finally, welfare programs often have to pay for services that people need, such as healthcare and food, which can be seen as unfair to those who are more financially responsible. Welfare is indeed bad!
1870	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars do not go to something that most people in the area would not find relevant. For example, a family of four might choose to check "education" so that their tax dollars can be allocated to their children's educational needs. Education is a direct benefit to the family. However, if this same family never became sick, they would uncheck "health care" to indicate that they do not want their tax dollars to go towards healthcare-related expenditures. This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized according to the wishes of the taxpayers.
1871	By using tax dollars, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. This would be more efficient as the money would be prioritized. For example, a family of four would check "education" so their tax dollars could go towards their children's education. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick, they would uncheck "health care".
1872	By deciding where our tax money is allocated, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain area. This would ensure that tax dollars are not wasted on matters that are of no relevance to the people. For example, a family of four would choose “education” so that their money can go towards their children’s education. Education directly affects the family. Now, if the family never got sick, they would choose “healthcare”. This system would be more effective as the money would be prioritized accordingly.
1873	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. This ensures that scarce tax dollars do not go to unnecessary or unpopular projects, and more money is directed towards those that are relevant to the public. For example, a family of four would check "education" so their money can go towards their children's education. Education directly affects the family's well-being. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck "health care". This system allows for greater efficiency in terms of how tax funds are allocated.
1874	By choosing where our taxes go, the government can determine which organizations/groups are most important to a certain precinct. That way, precious tax dollars don't end up in something that barely anyone in the area cares about, and more money goes towards things that are relevant to the people.  For example, a family of four would check "education," so their money can go towards their children. Education directly affects the family. Now, say they never got sick. Then they would uncheck health care.  This system would be more efficient in that the money is prioritized.
1875	I believe that school uniforms are a great option. Due to the gap between the wealthy and poor, school uniforms can be highly beneficial. If students were allowed to wear their own clothing, they would be concerned with the brands and quantities of clothes. This could lead to higher levels of inequality amongst teenagers. However, school uniforms are relatively inexpensive when compared to regular clothes, and provide students with a sense of unity and belonging. In my opinion, school uniforms are a convenient and cost-effective way to ensure that all students have access to quality clothing without any distractions.
1876	I take the view that school uniforms are very comfortable. This is because they provide a sense of unity, as everyone wears the same thing. This reduces social comparison in terms of clothes and brands. The poor students also benefit, since they don't have to worry about purchasing expensive clothes. Moreover, school uniforms are cost-effective as compared to regular clothes. Additionally, school uniforms make the students feel like they belong to a community, which is beneficial for their mental health. In my case, school uniforms are extremely convenient, since I didn't have to worry about what to wear during my student days.
1877	I believe that school uniforms can be very beneficial for students, especially those from less affluent backgrounds. Wearing school uniforms can help reduce the gap between rich and poor students by providing them with equal access to quality clothing. This can also reduce the stress that students may feel when it comes to shopping for clothes, as they are not concerned with wearing the latest trends or brands. It also gives a sense of community and belonging, as students can feel like they are part of a group.   From my own experience, school uniforms are very convenient. During my student days, I did not have to worry about what to wear in the morning, as I knew that I would be able to easily find something that was suitable for school. Additionally, this made life a lot easier when it came to doing laundry and making sure that my clothes were always clean and in good condition.
1878	I believe that school uniforms are very comfortable and practical. Because of the wealth gap, school uniforms can serve many purposes. If students were allowed to wear their own clothes every day, they would be concerned with the brand and quantity of their clothes. This could lead to feelings of inadequacy among the poorer students. School uniforms are more cost efficient than regular clothes and help foster a sense of community and belonging. In my experience, school uniforms are incredibly convenient and liberating. I no longer had to worry about my clothes during my student days.
1879	I take the view that school uniform is both comfortable and cost-effective. Because of the economic gap between the rich and the poor, school uniform is beneficial in many ways. If students were allowed to wear regular clothes every day, they would be concerned with issues of brand and quantity of clothes. This could lead to the poorer students feeling inferior. Although school uniforms are expensive, they are cheaper than regular clothes and have the added benefits of convenience, a sense of kinship and a sense of belonging. In my opinion, school uniform is an ideal solution. It is both cost-effective and convenient, which makes it a great choice for students during their school days.
1880	When young people are trying to find themselves, there is no need to completely give up their independence. I vote bad.

1885	No, I would not tell on him. It is possible that he killed the person for legitimate reasons, such as self-defence, or that he may have had a good reason for keeping the secret. I will keep his trust and I will not betray him. His secret is safe with me.
1886	No, I wouldn't tell on him as it is possible that he had a legitimate reason for killing the person or it could have been self-defence. I won't speak to the people if they come to me with questions, as I have full trust in him and he would never let me down for any reason. Furthermore, his secret is safe with me.
1887	I wouldn't tell on him, as it is impossible to know the reason behind the killing or whether it was for self defense. Furthermore, I would not betray his trust, as I know he would not betray mine. Additionally, his secret is safe with me.
1888	I would not inform on him, as it is possible that he had valid reasons for killing the person or it may have been self-defense. We do not know for sure, so I won't speak to the authorities unless I am compelled to do so. I have his trust and I will not let him down, so his secret is safe with me.
1889	I would not betray him. Even if the person was killed, we do not know the reason or the circumstances. It could have been premeditated, or it could have been self-defense. We don't know, and it's best to withhold judgment until we have more information. I trust him, and I won't let him down for any reason. Plus, his secret is safe with me.
1890	I believe books are more beneficial than television, as they impart more knowledge than television does.
1891	I believe books are better than television due to the increased knowledge they provide. Television is entertaining and can be educational, but books are more in depth and can provide a deeper understanding
1892	I believe books are always better than television, as they provide more knowledge than television does.
1893	I believe books provide more knowledge than television does. They are more effective at conveying information and providing deeper insights than television is.
1894	I believe books are more advantageous than television, as books impart more knowledge than television does.
1895	Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore as he was implementing measures that were not in accordance with Raffles' approval. I believe Farquhar was acting out of self-interest and not thinking about the best interests of the Singaporean people. Therefore, Raffles took necessary action to protect the population.
1896	Even though Raffles relieved Farquhar of his duties upon his return to Singapore, this was due to Farquhar's implementation of measures that were not sanctioned by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was taking measures that were ultimately detrimental to the people of Singapore, and Raffles intervened for the best interests of the population.
1897	Even though Raffles dismissed Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was enacting measures that had not been sanctioned by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was carrying out measures that were indirectly harmful to the population, and Raffles dismissed him for the benefit of Singapore's population in mind.
1898	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was implementing measures that were not approved of by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was implementing these measures out of concern for the wellbeing of the population, and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore and its people.
1899	Although Raffles dismissed Farquhar when he returned to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was taking actions that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was taking measures that were indirectly damaging to the population, and Raffles dismissed him for the best interests of Singapore's population in mind.
1900	It is important to start addressing childhood obesity at a young age to ensure a healthier future for our children.
1901	How can we expect to tackle childhood obesity if we don't start educating children about healthy eating habits from a young age?
1902	If we do not start educating children at a young age about healthy eating and exercise habits, how can we hope to curb childhood obesity?
1903	How can we expect to reduce childhood obesity if we don't begin at a young age?
1904	Starting at a young age is critical for combatting childhood obesity. If we don't teach kids about healthy eating and exercise habits at a young age, how will we expect them to make the necessary
1905	Farquhar's deeds had won the people's affections and respect, which was evident from the warm farewell he received when he was sacked. This showed just how important he was to the people of Singapore.
1906	Farquhar's actions won the people's affection and respect. When he was sacked, thousands of people bid him a fond farewell as he left Singapore. This shows the importance of Farquhar to the people.
1907	Farquhar's acts of kindness and generosity won him the respect and affection of the people. When he was dismissed, thousands of people said goodbye to him on his departure day, illustrating how much he was valued and appreciated. This proves his importance to the people of Singapore.
1908	Farquhar's actions earned him the affections and respect of the people, which was demonstrated when thousands said goodbye to him as he left Singapore. This shows the importance and impact he had on the community.
1909	Farquhar's actions won him the admiration and respect of the people. When he was dismissed, thousands of people said goodbye to him on the day of his departure, which illustrates the great importance he was held in by the people.
1910	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the freedom to choose pro-life. If I choose pro-life, I have no freedom.
1911	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the right to choose pro-life. If I choose pro-life, it is a decision that is not mine to make.
1912	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because it gives me the freedom to choose both pro-life and pro-choice. If I choose pro-life, then I have no choice.
1913	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the freedom and autonomy to choose pro-life if I want to. If I choose pro-life, then I have made that choice for myself.
1914	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the freedom to choose pro-life. If I choose pro-life, I have no free will.
1915	Science has proven that the evolutionary process was the beginning of life on Earth. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model that describes the origin of the universe, which started as an energetic explosion of matter and energy that eventually expanded and cooled, eventually forming the galaxies and stars that we observe today. As the universe has expanded and cooled over time, scientists have been able to infer that the conditions at the very beginning were ideal for life, forming the perfect conditions for Earth. Bacteria, fish, amphibians, monkeys, and humans all evolved from these initial simple organisms, forming the basis of our species.
1916	Science has established that evolution is the earliest stage in the development of life. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the origin of the universe, which posits that the universe was initially a dense and hot state. As time passed, the universe expanded and cooled, eventually giving rise to Earth and its ideal conditions for life. Initially, simple organic molecules formed, which evolved into fish and amphibians, followed by land animals, monkeys, and finally, humans.
1917	Evolution is the scientific theory that all life on Earth has descended from a common ancestor. The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing cosmological model which postulates that the universe began as a hot, dense space and has since been expanding and cooling. Scientists know this because of the observable phenomena of nearby galaxies receding from us and the universe becoming cooler over time. As a result, the universe in its past must have been hotter and denser. Earth was the ideal environment for life due to its "Goldilocks" conditions, allowing for the formation of bacteria, fish, amphibians, land animals, and eventually monkeys and humans.
1918	Science can demonstrate that evolution is the beginning of life. The Big Bang Theory is an accepted cosmological model that describes the rapid expansion of matter and energy that is thought to have occurred over 13.8 billion years ago. This event is believed to have been the origin of the universe, which has since been cooling and expanding. As a result, nearby galaxies are moving further and further away, and the universe is becoming increasingly less dense. As such, Earth was a suitable candidate for the emergence of life due to its ideal "Goldilocks" conditions. These circumstances provided the required conditions for the formation of bacteria, which evolved into fish, amphibians, land animals, and eventually primates and humans.
1919	Science confirms that the Big Bang Theory is the origin of the universe. According to this theory, the universe was initially a hot and dense space, which later expanded and cooled, forming nearby galaxies and Earth. This planet was uniquely suited for life due to its "Goldilocks" conditions. Biochemical processes led to the emergence of bacteria, fish, amphibians, land animals, and eventually monkeys and humans.
1920	Having a lousy father can have its advantages. He can teach you what not to do, how not to act, and how not to treat your family. He can toughen you up and help you learn to stand on your own two feet. You will always know who your father is and will never have to wonder if he was a saint or a lousy parent.
1921	A bad father could potentially teach you more than no one at all. He may be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. This is better than no teaching at all, I think. He could toughen you up. You will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.
1922	Having a lousy father can teach you invaluable lessons, such as how not to act or treat your family, and how to toughen up. You'll never have to wonder if your father was a saint or lousy - you'll know. Additionally, you'll have the benefit of knowing who he was and be able to learn from his mistakes. This is more beneficial than not knowing anything at all.
1923	A poor father could teach you more than no one at all. He could toughen you up, and you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, since you already know. His less-than-ideal example might also teach you to strive for better, and to never repeat his mistakes.  This is better than no teaching at all, I think.
1924	Having a lousy father can provide some benefits, such as learning what not to do and how to toughen up. Additionally, you will always know who your father is and never have to wonder if he was a saint or lousy.
1925	Plastic is beneficial as it is lightweight and convenient for transport.
1926	Plastic is useful and lightweight, making it a good choice for storage and transport.
1927	Plastic is useful, lightweight, and efficient for transport.
1928	Plastic is a lightweight and cost-effective option for transporting goods.
1929	Plastic is an excellent lightweight material that is well-suited for distributions.
1930	From a biological standpoint, men and women were meant to form relationships with each other. This idea has been distorted by the morals and social conventions of our time.
1931	From a biological standpoint, men and women were designed to complement each other. This concept has been warped by the morals and social norms of our time.
1932	From a biological standpoint, men and women were designed to be together. This concept was distorted by the morals and societal norms of our time.
1933	From a biological standpoint, men and women were designed to fit together. This idea was distorted by the morals and culture of our era.
1934	From a biological standpoint, men and women were designed to fit together. This idea has been warped by the morals and norms of our time.
1935	Christianity is inconsistent with scientific findings in many areas, including history, archaeology, astronomy, biology, and other disciplines. It also contradicts rational and impartial reasoning. The arguments for Christianity are weak, compared to one or two that may hold up, but atheism is the more logical position overall.
1936	Christianity conflicts with scientific evidence such as historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of data. It denies rational and impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator, contain numerous contradictions and are logically flawed. The arguments for Christianity don't hold up (with one or two exceptions). Atheism is a more rational position than Christianity.
1937	There is evidence that conflicts with Christianity, such as historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms. This evidence contradicts Christian teachings, which were written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe. Arguments for Christianity are not compelling, and atheism is the more logical stance due to this lack of evidence.
1938	There is ample evidence that contradicts the teachings of Christianity. This evidence includes historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of information. Furthermore, Christianity’s teachings, which were written by an all powerful, all knowing creator of the universe, contain many inconsistencies. The arguments for atheism are much more logical than those for Christianity, with the exception of one or two minor exceptions.
1939	The claims of Christianity contradict overwhelming evidence from historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other fields of study. Its teachings, written by an all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe, contain too many glaring inconsistencies to be taken seriously. The arguments for Christianity do not hold up under scrutiny (with one or two exceptions). Atheism is the more rational position of the two.
1940	No one ever said science is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science, science admits it doesn't have all the answers, while religion is so dogmatic that it fails to recognize facts, and even what truth really stands for.
1941	No one ever said science is perfect. That's the difference between religion and science. Science admits it doesn't have all the answers, whereas religion is so dogmatic that it cannot even recognize the facts. And even what truth really stands for.
1942	No one ever said science is infallible. That's the distinction between Religion and Science, Science admits its errors while Religion is too rigid to even acknowledge Facts. Even if we consider Truth to be true, it's still up for interpretation.
1943	No one ever said science is infallible. That's the difference between Religion and Science, Science admits it doesn't have all the answers while Religion is so dogmatic that it cannot even recognize Facts. Even what Truth really stands for.

1945	If the child is punished, they will learn the consequences of their actions and be less likely to repeat them, as I know from experience.
1946	This can be effective, but it is important to be careful not to cause more harm than good. It's best to find a balance between punishing the child and teaching them the consequences of their actions.
1947	I believe that disciplinary actions should be taken to teach children the consequences of their actions. For example, if a child misbehaves, it should be made clear to them that this type of behavior is unacceptable and it should be made clear how
1948	I believe that this is the best approach to discipline a child. When one is corrected in a loving yet firm manner, they are more likely to understand why their action was inappropriate and learn from the experience. I know this from personal experience.
1949	I believe that disciplining a child in this manner can help them learn not to repeat the behavior, as I have experienced myself.
1950	I believe that spanking a child is appropriate when they know they have done something wrong. The child will be more likely to understand the consequence of their actions when they are afraid of repeating them. Actions speak louder than words.
1951	I believe that a child should be disciplined when they know they have done something wrong. This will help them to understand the consequences of their actions. Actions speak louder than words and a fear of repeating the mistake will be more effective in imprinting the lesson on the child's mind.
1952	I believe that spanking a child may be appropriate in certain situations, such as when they know they have done wrong. Words alone may not be enough to get the message across, especially if the child is younger. Actions, however, should always be used in conjunction with words; children should understand why they are being disciplined and the consequences of their actions.
1953	I believe that spanking a child can be beneficial when they know they have done something wrong. The fear of repeating the mistake should be greater than the fear of the physical punishment. Actions always speak louder than words.
1954	I believe that spanking a child is appropriate only when they understand the consequences of their actions. A child is more likely to understand and internalize the lesson if they are frightened of repeating the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.
1955	I don't believe that spanking should be the only form of discipline, as it would be over in just a moment, but a punishment could last up to two or three weeks, or maybe even longer.
1956	I don't believe that spanking should be necessary, as it would only last a moment, whereas punishing could last up to two or three weeks, or even more.
1957	I do not think that spanking should be necessary, but punishing can last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
1958	I don't think that spanking should be the only form of discipline used, as it would only last for a moment, but punishing a child can last for up to two or three weeks, or even longer in some cases.
1959	I do not believe that spanking is necessary, as it would only be a momentary punishment, but disciplinary measures such as corrective punishments and verbal warnings could last up to two or three weeks or even longer depending on the severity of the offense.
1960	I would say yes to some circumstances and no to others. In some cases, I would not turn the person in, for example if they killed in self-defense or to defend another person. Another example would be if they killed in reaction to another person being killed. However, if they killed cold-heartedly, such as in the case of rape, for money, objects, or out of a pure dislike of someone, then I would turn them in.
1961	I would say yes in some cases but no in others. I would not turn them in if my spouse killed a person in self-defence or in defence of another person. Another circumstance where I would not report them is if they killed a person for revenge or for money, objects or animals. However, if they killed in a cold and heartless manner, such as rape or for money, then I would turn them in, because someone who is that callous could also kill me.
1962	I would say yes in some cases and no in others. If it was in self-defence or defence of another person, then no, I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed in response to being killed, such as in an act of revenge. If it was a cold-blooded killing, such as for money, objects or just a disliking of someone, then yes, I would turn them in, because someone that's that calculating could kill me.
1963	I would say yes in some cases, but not others. I would not turn them in if my spouse had acted in self-defence or to defend another person. Another circumstance where I would not report them is if they had acted to protect someone else from being killed. However, if they had committed the crime for money, objects, or out of a pure dislike for someone, then I would turn them in. Cold-hearted killers like this could still pose a threat and may kill again, so it is better to be safe than sorry.
1964	I would say yes in some cases, but not in others. In some cases, I might say no. I would not turn them in if my spouse killed someone in self-defense or to defend another person. Another situation in which I might not turn them in is if they killed someone in order to avenge the death of someone else. However, if they committed the murder out of a colder, more calculated intent such as for money, objects, or just a dislike of the person, then I would turn them in.
1965	Doesn't it say in the Declaration of Independence that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
1966	The Declaration of Independence states that we have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
1967	The Declaration of Independence states that "all men are endowed by their Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
1968	The Declaration of Independence states that "all men are endowed by their Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
1969	It does indeed say in the Declaration of Independence that we have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness".
1970	I believe that it is likely related to the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain may not be complete by the age of 18, which could pose a risk of greater damage from alcohol consumption. Whether or not this is the case, it appears to be a commonly used excuse for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, then they should be old enough to responsibly consume alcohol.
1971	I believe that it has something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain may not be fully complete by the age of 18, which could put them at risk of more serious damage from alcohol. Whether true or not, it seems to be a commonly used excuse for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if someone is old enough to die for their country, they should also be old enough to enjoy a drink responsibly.
1972	I believe that it may have something to do with the fact that for some people, the development of the human brain is not fully mature until the age of 21, which could put them at risk of serious harm from alcohol use. Whether this is true or not, it appears to be a common justification for the age limit. I personally believe that if you are old enough to die for your country, you should be old enough to responsibly enjoy a drink.
1973	I believe that it might have something to do with the fact that for some individuals, the development of the human brain is not fully complete until later ages, which could pose a risk of greater harm being caused by alcohol consumption at younger ages. Whether or not this is true, it seems to be a common justification for setting the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if someone is old enough to fight and die for their country, then they should also be old enough to responsibly enjoy a drink.
1974	I believe that it might be due to the fact that for some individuals, the development of the human brain is not complete by the age of 18, which could lead to more serious consequences from consuming alcohol. Whether this is true or not, it appears to be a common justification for the legal drinking age. I personally believe that if one is old enough to die for their country, they should be old enough to have a drink.
1975	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it weren't rape, then there would be nothing to take to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the trick is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I am not aware of any specific court cases.
1976	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to take to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the key is whether or not the courts are convicting the true perpetrator or not. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I do not know of any specific court cases.

1979	All of them. That's why it is called rape. If it were not rape, then there would be nothing to take to court about. Regardless of individual court cases, the challenge is whether or not the courts are convicting the true rapist or not. One fine line, however, may be that of statutory rape in which the so-called victim has consented or even initiated sexual relations. Of this I am unaware of any specific court cases.
1980	It appears that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of the laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (such as seat belt laws) to protect ourselves from harm, yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. What I find most frustrating is the artificiality of claiming that these laws are meant to "save lives" when, in reality, I believe the underlying motivation is to save other taxpayers from having to bear the financial burden of caring for those injured from "riskier" behavior. (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use) If we were honest and simply said that these things are illegal because we as a society do not want to bear the cost of medical care for those who choose to engage in such activities, I believe most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1981	It appears that what bothers you the most is the lack of consistency in the laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (e.g. seatbelt laws) to protect individuals from harming themselves. While I understand the intention, I find it irritating that we do not enforce similar regulations on other forms of self-harm. What I find most aggravating is the artificiality of claiming that these laws are enacted to “save lives”, when in reality it is taxpayers who end up footing the bill for the medical care of those who have chosen to engage in risky behavior. (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.) If we were honest and acknowledged that the true purpose of these laws is to save taxpayers money, then I think most of us would have a better opinion of them.
1982	It seems that what bothers you most is the inconsistency of laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect ourselves from harming ourselves -- yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives." I believe the reality is that we pass these laws to save other taxpayers from having to pay for the costs associated with a person's healthcare due to self-harming behavior. (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.) If we were just honest, and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less "safe" behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1983	It appears that your main issue is with the inconsistency of laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place (like the seatbelt law) to protect us from harming ourselves - yet we have not legislated all forms of self-harm. What I find most annoying is the artificiality of saying we pass these laws to "save lives," when in reality it is to save other taxpayers from having to bear the cost of someone else's health care if they choose to engage in risky behavior.

If we were just honest and said these things are illegal because we as a society don't want to have to bear the costs associated with medically caring for those injured as a result of less safe behavior, I think most of us would find such laws much less distasteful.
1984	It appears that your main objection is to the inconsistency of these laws. We have laws that are supposedly in place to protect people from harming themselves – yet we have not legislated against all forms of self-harm. I think what bothers you most is the artificiality of saying that we pass these laws to “save lives” when, in reality, the motivation may be to save other taxpayers from having to pay for the healthcare costs of people who engage in risky behaviors. (Examples: seat belts, motorcycle helmets, recreational drug use.) If we were more honest and said that these activities are illegal because we don’t want to have to bear the costs associated with caring for those injured as a result of such activities, then these laws would be much less distasteful.
1985	In response to another person's statement, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and protect people from harm. It would also save hospitals an untold number of patients from cigarette-induced cancer. Cigarette companies do not deserve to remain profitable; I would love to see them lose their jobs and become jobless. Those who support the legality of cigarettes are naive and wrong.
1986	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and healthcare costs. It would also save hospitals from thousands of patients with cigarette-induced cancer.  This is not a loss of money; it would only save lives and money.  Besides, the tobacco industry deserves to crash. I would love to see that day. All those slimy salespeople selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers, medics and firefighters. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1987	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and protect the health of many. It would also save hospitals the trouble of caring for patients with cigarette-induced cancer. Making cigarettes illegal would not be a financial loss for hospitals. On the contrary, it would be a gain for society. In addition, I would love to see the tobacco industry suffer. Sleazebags who profit from selling death do not deserve to have jobs. Furthermore, those of you who support the legality of cigarettes are losers.
1988	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and save hospitals the trouble of caring for patients with cigarette-induced cancer. It would only bring a financial benefit to society, as the money currently spent on cigarettes would be put to better use. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to crash, and I would love to see that day. All those sleazeballs selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers, medics, and firefighters. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1989	In response to another person's answer, if cigarettes were made illegal, it would save countless lives and money. It would only harm hospitals and firefighters, who are not teachers or medics, but still, it is not a loss of money. Besides, the cigarette industry deserves to crash. I would love to see that day. All those sleazeballs selling death deserve to be jobless. Not teachers and medics, but still, it is not a loss of money. Those of you who support cigarette legality are losers.
1990	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, not just in the education system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but separate". However, when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and economic limitations. The disparities in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor, mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an argument that the system is now not "separate but equal" due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1991	I believe Brown v. Board of Education was successful in integrating the education system as a whole and reversing the previous SCOTUS decision of "separate but equal". In terms of the spirit of the law, however, the issue of unequal school funding remains. This is due to geographical and economic limitations that prevent some communities from being able to fund their local schools to the same level as others. Thus, we are still not truly achieving "equal but separate" in regards to educational resources.
1992	I think it is fair to say that Brown v. Board of Education was largely successful in its original intent of desegregating the education system in America. However, nearly seven decades after the historic ruling, there is still a great deal of inequality in the educational resources available to students across the country. This is due in part to geographic and economic disparities, which have allowed certain schools in wealthy, mostly suburban communities to receive much more funding than those in poorer, mostly urban neighborhoods. This unequal funding has created an even greater educational gap, going beyond the simple concept of “separate but equal” and into the realm of “not equal at all.” Thus, it is clear that there is still much progress to be made in order to achieve true educational equality in the United States.
1993	I think it is two distinct questions: the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of “separate but equal,” ruling that racial segregation in public education was unconstitutional. However, when one looks at the spirit of the law, it is still lacking, primarily due to geographical and economic disparities. Disproportionate funding in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods compared to poor, mostly urban neighborhoods is still an issue we have yet to address. One could easily make an argument that the system is now not "separate" but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1994	I think it's really two different questions, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Overwhelmingly Brown v. Board was successful in beginning the integration of the whole of America, not just in the educational system, overturning the previous SCOTUS decision of "equal but separate". However, when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and financial limitations. The disproportion in schools in affluent, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor, mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with. One could easily make an argument that the system is now not separate but still unequal due to the ability of communities to fund their local schools, not due to any prejudice.
1995	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1996	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you.  I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education.   You shouldn't have a problem with it.
1997	Let them know exactly what you wrote here. They may choose to excuse or reschedule you, as you are a student away at college and have missed classes due to this summons. If you are studying, they should understand and forgive any absences. You should not have any issues.
1998	Tell them exactly what you posted here. They should excuse or re-schedule you. I was summoned while away at college, and was waived/excused twice because of that (since I was not living in town at the time). If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.

If you're studying in college, they will excuse you, so you don't miss any education. You shouldn't have a problem with it.
2000	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, an honest person could have easily bought as many guns as they want off a street corner in a single day. The criminals have it made in this country. Why do they make people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with - New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.   Why shouldn't there be a national standard on gun laws? Shouldn't gun rights be protected at the national level, instead of left to the individual states?
2001	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the mean time, you could have bought as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with; New York, for instance, is one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.   Shouldn't there be a national standard on gun laws? Should individual states be able to create their own laws concerning something so deeply entrenched in the Constitution?  The Second Amendment states, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” It is clear that the founders of this nation were aware of the importance of being able to bear arms and wished to ensure the citizens’ right to do so. Yet, different states interpret the Second Amendment in a variety of ways, leading to confusion and difficulty for honest citizens looking to exercise their right to bear arms. A universal standard needs to be established to ensure that the rights of law-abiding citizens to own firearms are not infringed, while still keeping in mind the importance of public safety.
2002	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time off work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, as well as filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, it is possible to buy as many weapons as desired off a street corner in one day without any hassle. This is certainly not the case for law-abiding citizens in the United States, who are made to jump through numerous hoops in order to access their Second Amendment rights.   The fact that the federal government has not established a national standard on gun laws is a significant issue. The Constitution clearly states that gun regulations shall be handled at the state level, yet states such as New York have created some of the most stringent regulations and background checks in the country. The wide range of gun laws in different states make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to travel between states and exercise their Second Amendment rights.
2003	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meantime, you could have bought as many of whatever you want off a street corner in one day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even harder to deal with, like New York, which has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation. They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.  Why shouldn't there be a national standard on gun control? Shouldn't gun laws be uniform across the nation? This would make it easier for citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights while still protecting communities from gun violence. Additionally, a national standard for gun control would ensure that the laws are based on evidence and research, rather than individual states’ preferences.
2004	Yes, in North Carolina, there is a three day waiting period to purchase a handgun. This is after you have taken the time from work to take a state-mandated firearms safety course, gone to your county's sheriff's office and filled out the necessary paperwork for a criminal background check and FBI search, and filled out an application for handgun purchase. In the meanwhile, one could purchase as many firearms as desired off a street corner in a single day and be done with it. The criminals have it made in this country...why do they make honest people go through so much to get a handgun? I know other states are even more difficult to deal with—New York being one of the toughest! They're trying to make honest people not want to even have guns.  Why shouldn't there be a national standard on gun laws? Shouldn't the Constitution be upheld, as it is written, and should individual states not be able to create their own laws that infringe on a citizen's right to bear arms? The Second Amendment states, “A well regulated Militia, being a strong check against disorderly and turbulent Minds, shall be regulated and the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” It is clear that the Founding Fathers thought this right to bear arms was essential, and a national standard should be set to protect it.
2005	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The press often exaggerates issues to sell papers, as was the case with Guantanamo.  While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured, but the UN is still using the accusations to bash the US.  Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture, so if you feed them it's not considered torture.  If you don't feed them, it is considered torture.  Finally, prisoners have an incentive to lie about their treatment while incarcerated, which is a form of political power they can use.
2006	Before you start writing your paper, make sure you have all the facts. The media loves to sensationalize issues and Guantanamo Bay is no exception. While the detainees were certainly embarrassed, they were not physically harmed. The UN still cites these accusations and uses them to bash the US.  Additionally, the UN has declared that force-feeding prisoners on hunger strike is a form of torture. If you feed them, it's torture. If you don't and they starve, it's still torture. Prisoners will use lies about their treatment as a form of political power while incarcerated.
2007	Before writing your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The press often exaggerates issues to sell newspapers, as was the case with Guantanamo.  Despite accusations, the inmates were not actually tortured, yet the UN is still using the issue to criticize the United States.  Furthermore, the UN has stated that force-feeding prisoners during a hunger strike is considered torture.  So, if you don’t feed them, it’s torture; if you do and they die, it’s also torture.  Additionally, prisoners may lie about their treatment as a form of political power while incarcerated.
2008	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The press often sensationalizes issues to sell more papers, as was the case with Guantanamo. While the prisoners were indeed humiliated, they were not tortured. The UN continues to use the accusations against the U.S., despite the fact that the prisoners were receiving adequate care. Additionally, the UN has determined that force-feeding prisoners who go on a hunger strike is a form of torture. If the prisoners are not fed, it is also considered torture. Furthermore, prisoners will often lie about their treatment as a form of political power while incarcerated.
2009	Before you write your paper, make sure that you have the facts.  The media often sensationalizes issues to sell more papers, and the Guantanamo Bay prison was no exception. Accusations still persist, even though the prisoners were not actually tortured.  Additionally, the UN has determined that force-feeding prisoners who go on hunger strike is considered torture, providing a narrow exception to the widely held understanding that not feeding prisoners is considered non-invasive treatment.  Finally, prisoners have an incentive to exaggerate or fabricate claims of mistreatment as a form of political leverage while incarcerated.
2010	I'm relocating to Singapore in the coming months and I've discovered that they have a much lower tax rate than the US. Additionally, they impose heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and designer brand clothes. This is driving many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, where tax burdens are lighter. High taxes appear to be causing a mass exodus from certain countries, resulting in a loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are seeing great benefits from this, as well as multinational companies who have been doing this for years. Individuals are now following suit and pursuing tax-efficient solutions as well. MNCs have been getting away with it for years, and individuals are now beginning to take advantage of the same opportunities.
2011	I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have a much lower tax rate than the US. They impose heavy taxes on items such as cars and designer clothes, but not on income. This is encouraging people in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden there is too high, especially in Europe. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which is resulting in a loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefitting greatly from this. Multinational companies have been doing this for years, and individuals are now starting to follow suit.
2012	I am moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have a low tax rate compared to the US. In addition, they have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand-name clothing. This is prompting many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden is too high in certain European countries. This is causing a mass exodus from these countries, resulting in a loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefitting greatly from this, as well as multinational corporations (MNCs) who have been doing it for years. Individuals are now also beginning to take advantage of this.
2013	I'm relocating to Singapore in the coming months and have discovered that their tax system is flat, much lower than the US, and they impose heavy luxury taxes on items such as cars and brand-name clothing. This is causing many employees in my company to relocate to different parts of Asia, as the tax burden is too heavy in many European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries, resulting in a loss of tax income for those places. Places like Dubai and Singapore are profiting greatly from this, and multinational companies (MNC) have been doing it for years, while individuals are now joining in as well. MNCs have been shifting their profits to these countries for years to avoid the higher taxes in mature economies.
2014	In light of the rising tax burden in certain countries, many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia. This is due to the relatively lower tax rates found in countries like Singapore. High taxes appear to be causing an exodus from some countries, resulting in losses of tax income. On the other hand, places such as Dubai and Singapore are benefitting greatly from the tax difficulties faced in mature economies. MNCs have been doing it for years and individuals are now following suit.
2015	Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my high school only had three AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level, so that students who are struggling can have a better chance of understanding the material. Additionally, those who are excelling academically can be placed in higher level classes which will stimulate them and keep them engaged. This will prevent students from becoming bored with the curriculum.
2016	Some people may become bored in their classes if they are not challenged enough. Not every school has advanced classes available, and my own high school had only three AP classes. To ensure that all students are able to learn and stay engaged, schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Those who are struggling can take lower-level classes, while those who are excelling can be placed in higher-level classes to keep them interested and engaged in the curriculum. Furthermore, students who are excelling in one area may be able to access higher-level classes in other areas, allowing them to stay challenged and motivated.
2017	Some people may be really bored in their classes due to the lack of challenge. Not every school offers advanced classes, and I know my high school had only three AP classes. To ensure that students are learning and engaged in the curriculum, schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. For those who are exceeding, this could mean being placed in higher-level classes. For those who are struggling, it could mean being placed in easier classes where they can have a better chance of comprehending the material.  This way, no student has to feel like they are failing a class due to lack of challenge.
2018	Some people may be bored in their classes because they are not being challenged enough. Not every school has access to advanced classes, and I know my high school had only three AP classes. To make learning more interesting and engaging, schools should assess each student's level of ability and place them in classes accordingly. Students who are struggling should be placed in lower-level classes, while those who are excelling should be given more difficult material. This will help them stay engaged, and also ensure that they are not bored with the curriculum.
2019	Some people may become bored in their classes if they are not challenged enough. Not every school has access to advanced classes, and my high school only had three AP classes. It would be beneficial for schools to place students in classes based on their ability level, so that they can have an appropriate level of difficulty. This way, students who are struggling may take a lower level class that is more accessible to them, and the students who are excelling can move on to higher level courses. Furthermore, those who are doing very well may become bored with the curriculum, which could potentially lead to them becoming apathetic toward their studies. Therefore, it would be beneficial to offer more advanced courses for these students to take.
2020	Not only this, but anything "intrinsic" to that person is more a product of their environment than something they choose or even their genetics.  "Give me a child until they're 7, and I will give you the man."  The world is one big chaotic system. Literally every single choice you make, even subconscious ones, come together to create your destiny, so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make eventually lead to larger and larger impacts anyway.
2021	Not only this, but anything "intrinsic" to that person is more due to an environment outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics.  "Give me a child until they're seven and I will give you the man."  The world is one big chaotic system. Every choice you make, even subconscious ones, comes together to create your destiny, so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make decide through the butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
2022	Not only this, but anything "intrinsic" to that person is more due to environmental factors outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics.  "Give me a child until they are seven, and I will give you the man."  The world is a complex, chaotic system. Even seemingly trivial choices as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child, as the butterfly effect often takes precedence over meaningful choices.
2023	Not only this, but anything "intrinsic" to that person is more due to an environment which is outside of their control than something they choose or even genetics.  "Give me a child until they are seven, and I will give you the man."  The world is one big chaotic system. Literally every single choice you make, even subconscious ones, come together to create your destiny, so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make determine our path through the butterfly effect more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
2024	Not only this, but anything “intrinsic” to that person is more a product of their environment than something they choose, or even their genetics.  “Give me a child until they are seven, and I will give you the man.”  The world is one big, chaotic system. Literally every single choice you make, even unconscious ones, comes together to create your destiny, so the choices you do make as an adult are a product of how the world treats you as a child and the seemingly meaningless mundane choices we make form habits that shape our perspectives and behaviors, more than the ones that seem meaningful anyway.
2025	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens based on just one example of a planet with life. If we had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars. It would look the same.
2026	I don't think that a single example of a planet with life can be used to statistically infer the probability of the existence of aliens in the universe. If we had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. Alternatively, if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life. However, with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe? It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars. It would look the same. e: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else. My point is that I don't think you can make an estimate of the probability of aliens existing in the universe with a single example.
2027	I do not think you can make a conclusive statistical argument for the existence of aliens when there is only one example of a planet with life. If we had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could potentially conclude that life evolves at least twice per galaxy. Similarly, if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could infer that life probably evolves in every star with planets. However, with just a single example, it is difficult to determine the probability of life existing elsewhere. It could be once per universe, once per galaxy, or once per 100 stars. It would look the same.
2028	I don't think you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when you have only one example of a planet with life.

It would look the same.   e: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else. My point is that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all.
2029	I do not believe that you can make a statistical argument for the existence of aliens when we have only one example of a planet with life.

2030	I don't think it's even close. Owen Wilson's mock Southern accent keeps switching throughout the movie, and the death scene in The Life Aquatic isn't nearly as powerful as Luke Wilson's suicide in The Royal Tenenbaums. It helps that Needle in the Hay is playing in the background. And the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie (besides Future Man "You look like a banana" in Bottle Rocket) is the tennis scene.
2031	Nowhere close. Owen Wilson's fake Southern accent is all over the place in The Life Aquatic, and the death scene pales in comparison to Luke Wilson's suicide in Rushmore. It helps that Needle in the Hay is playing, and the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie (besides Future Man's "You look like a banana" line in Bottle Rocket) is the tennis scene.
2032	Not even close. Owen Wilson's phony-southern accent flip-flops throughout the movie, and the death scene in The Life Aquatic is a pale comparison to Luke Wilson's suicide in Rushmore. It helps that Needle in the Hay is playing in the background. And the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie (besides Future Man's "You look like a banana" line in Bottle Rocket) is the tennis scene.
2033	Not even close. Owen Wilson's Kentucky Fried accent is all over the place, and the death scene in The Life Aquatic pales in comparison to Luke Wilson's suicide scene in Rushmore. It helps that Needle in the Hay is playing, and the funniest 15 seconds of any Wes Anderson movie (besides Future Man's "You look like a banana" line in Bottle Rocket) is the tennis scene.
2034	Wes Anderson's films are incredibly entertaining, particularly The Royal Tenenbaums. The Death scene in The Life Aquatic is unfortunately not as powerful as Luke Wilson's suicide in The Royal Tenenbaums, but it is still very affecting. Additionally, the soundtrack in both films is excellent, and helps to heighten the emotional moments. Moreover, the tennis scene in The Royal Tenenbaums is among the funniest 15 seconds of any Anderson film. In conclusion, Anderson's films are among the best and most entertaining in recent memory.
2035	Assuming there is a high number of zombies on the block, I would choose the chainsaw. I would then down the block while I spin in a circle, creating a circle of undead carnage. If there are only a few zombies, the shotgun is the better choice due to its increased range.
2036	A chainsaw would need to be loaded and fired. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in a circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of range.)
2037	Assuming that the zombie population is densely packed, I would choose to use the chainsaw. I would start the chainsaw and then proceed down the block while I continually spin in a circle, creating a circular pattern of zombie carnage. (If there are only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of range.)
2038	Assuming the zombie population on this block is dense, I would opt for the chainsaw. I would fire the shotgun repeatedly, while also performing a circle motion to maximize my damage. This way, I could clear out the zombies without having to get too close. As the saying goes: better to be safe than sorry.
2039	A shotgun would need to be loaded and fired. A chainsaw is continuously running. Assuming the zombie population on this block is densely packed, I would pick the chainsaw. I'd go down the block while spinning in circle: a spinning circle of undead carnage. (Although if there is only a few zombies, the shotgun has the advantage of distance.)
2040	Cats are wonderful animals and pets. They are independent and have a will of their own, so you don't need to take care of them constantly. They don't require the same level of attention that dogs do, as they often seem too content to do their own thing. Cats are also quite affectionate, but require a bit more effort to earn their love. They aren't as dependent as dogs, so you don't have to clean up after them, nor do you have to put up with any of their barking or other noisy habits. You don't have to walk them, or deal with any of the drooling, or the unwanted visitors that puppies often bring. Cats are quite adorable, too. In short, cats are the perfect pet - and so much better than dogs!
2041	Cats are wonderful creatures and make excellent pets. They are independent and take care of themselves to a large extent, which is a huge benefit. They are not always as happy and affectionate as dogs, but they are still very loving creatures. "Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell out like dogs do" (Jack Burns, Meet the Parents). With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their poop, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no shitting all over the place, no puppies peeing all over the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures. Dogs are...well....:sigh; dogs!
2042	Cats are independent, self-sufficient pets that don't require as much attention and care as dogs. You don't need to take them everywhere you go and watch them all the time since they can take care of themselves. They can also be quite adorable. On the other hand, dogs are loyal companions that can be fun to have around, but they do require more attention and cleaning up after. They also make more noise and can be a lot of work. Ultimately, both cats and dogs can make wonderful pets, depending on the person's preferences.
2043	Cats, definitely. They are independent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and have to watch them and make sure they eat and use the facilities because they can't on their own. Cats are amazing animals and pets. They aren't always happy like dogs are, almost to the point where they are too stupid to know the difference. Jack Burns from Meet the Parents said, “Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do.” With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their shit, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures. Dogs are...well....:sigh; dogs!
2044	Cats are certainly wonderful animals and pets. They are independent and can take care of themselves to a great extent. You don't have to take them everywhere you go and worry about making sure they are eating and using the bathroom, like you would with a dog. This is because cats are not as attached or loyal as dogs, almost to the point of being too stupid to know the difference.  "Cats make you work for their affection, they don't sell-out like dogs do" Jack Burns from Meet the Parents! With cats, there is no cleaning up the yard, having to walk a dog and cleaning up their sh$t, no loud-ass barks in the middle of the night, no slobbering all over the place, no puppies pissing all over the floor, etc. Cats are adorable creatures. Dogs are...well....:sigh; dogs!
2045	This is way too sweeping an assertion, just because someone is a “dictator” doesn't mean they should be removed permanently, let alone assassinated. Who gets to decide if someone is a dictator, and even if the world agrees, why should we kill them? There have been both good and bad non-dictators, so blanket judgments should be avoided.
2046	This is an overly broad statement. Being a “dictator” does not necessarily warrant their removal, much less permanently. Who would decide that a nation’s leader is a dictator? If the world agrees, why assassinate them? There have been both “beneficial” and “malicious” non-dictators.
2047	This statement is too broad and simplistic. Being a “dictator” is not a sufficient reason to assassinate, much less permanently eliminate, a leader. Who gets to decide that a nation’s ruler is a dictator? Assassinating a leader is a serious matter, and assuming the world agrees on the dictator label, why take that step? There have been both “beneficial” and “evil” non-dictators.
2048	This is far too sweeping an assertion, to simply assassinate a leader because they are a "dictator" with no further explanation. Who gets to decide which countries' leaders are dictators? Even if the world agrees that a particular leader is a dictator, why should they be assassinated? There have been both good and bad non-dictator leaders as well.
2049	This blanket assertion is too harsh. Being a "dictator" does not necessarily warrant the permanent removal of that leader, as there may be mitigating circumstances that make their continued leadership unnecessary. Furthermore, who is to determine which leaders are dictators? If the world were to agree on a particular nation's leader being a dictator, it is still questionable whether or not assassination is the most appropriate solution.

2065	I don't have a positive opinion of IE. It has a history of stealing ideas from other browsers, and it is unable to run extensions, making it limited in its functionality.
2066	I strongly oppose the idea of Internet Explorer. I believe that they have stolen the concept of tabbed browsing from other browsers, and extensions are not available for it.
2067	Internet Explorer has some flaws, including its tab-browsing feature which it borrowed from other browsers. Unfortunately, there are limited extensions available for it.
2068	I find Internet Explorer to be subpar, having stolen the idea of tabbed browsing from other browsers without providing the same level of extension support.
2069	Internet Explorer is not very popular and I find its lack of features to be a major drawback. It also stole the idea of tabbed browsing from other browsers, making it difficult to obtain extensions for it.
2070	I prefer the popping up windows that come with Chrome compared to the ones that come with Firefox.
2071	I appreciate the convenience of those cute little popup windows. You don't get that same experience with Firefox.
2072	I find Mozilla Firefox to be lacking in comparison to other web browsers in terms of its lack of popup windows.
2073	I appreciate the features provided by popup windows. Firefox does not offer them, but I am still able to find satisfactory alternatives.
2074	I appreciate the convenience of pop-up windows. They are not available with Firefox.
2075	I don't want to say I officially have a position, but I want someone on the other side to answer this, because I honestly just don't know: if a 14-year-old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro-life decision? Is it then pro-life to have an abortion? I just don't know and I want an answer from someone on the other side.

2085	I believe that uniforms are beneficial for both boys and girls. This would help put an end to teasing amongst girls regarding fashion and help create an atmosphere of equality in the classroom. Additionally, this could result in increased focus on schoolwork as students would not have to worry about whether or not they are wearing the most expensive clothes or if they look the coolest or prettiest.
2086	I believe that dress code policies are beneficial. This would reduce teasing between girls regarding fashion issues and make all students feel equal, which would in turn increase their attention on school work since they would not need to worry about looking the most expensive or coolest in school.
2087	I believe that uniforms are beneficial. In doing so, girls will not tease each other about fashion-related issues, and all students will look and feel equal, which might lead to increased attention on school work since they do not have to worry about whether they are wearing the most expensive clothes to school or if they look the coolest and the prettiest and so on.
2088	I believe that uniforms are beneficial in numerous ways. Girls would no longer tease each other over fashion issues, and everyone would feel more equal and focused on their studies since they would not have to worry about being the most fashionable or coolest kid in school. Furthermore, uniforms have the potential to unite students and foster a sense of camaraderie. Everyone would look the same and thus, students would be less likely to focus on material possessions and more likely to focus on their education.
2089	I believe that uniforms would be beneficial for everyone. This would prevent the teasing of girls regarding fashion issues and would also make all students feel equal, potentially resulting in increased attention on schoolwork since they would not have to worry about being the best dressed or coolest person in the school.
2090	Atheism makes my logic work, and I'm not afraid of anything.
2091	I find Atheism to be quite reasonable. It allows me to make logical decisions and not be afraid of anything.
2092	Atheism is a pretty cool position. It allows for objective reasoning and leaves no room for fear or superstition.
2093	Atheism is a reasonable worldview. It allows me to use logic and reason and not be afraid of anything.
2094	Eh, Atheism is a pretty cool ideology. It helps me make sense of the world and doesn't shy away from any topics.
2095	It is unwise and foolish to claim that God does not exist. Any other argument is unsound.

2098	It is foolish and unscientific to claim that God does not exist. Any other argument is unsupported and without merit.
2099	It is irrational and silly to believe that god exists. Any other point of view is completely unsound.
2100	Yes, while other forms of discipline may be effective, sometimes a smack on the rear is necessary to make sure the child understands their mistake. However, discipline should never be excessive, and should always be tailored to the individual child and the situation.
2101	Yes, although other forms of discipline may work better in some cases, a firm but loving swat on the behind can be effective in teaching children that their behavior was inappropriate. Corporal punishment should not be done indiscriminately, but used as a last resort when other methods have failed.
2102	Yes, corporal punishment can be an effective way of disciplining children in certain situations, but it should not be used excessively or as a form of punishment without due cause.
2103	Yes, while other forms of discipline may be effective in some cases, spanking can be an effective way of making a child understand that their behavior was wrong. Discipline should always be tailored to the situation and to the child, and not be excessive.
2104	Yes, it's understandable that sometimes a mild spanking may be necessary to make a child understand that their behavior is unacceptable. However, this should not be done excessively or without cause.
2105	Yes, because young people have plenty of potential and are still maturing, meaning they are capable of making important contributions to society.  They may not fully understand the world yet, but they can still grow and develop their skills.
2106	No, because they don't really comprehend what they are doing since they are merely children, still learning and trying to comprehend the world.
2107	No, not until they are older and more mature, since growing up and gaining an understanding of the world is still a foreign concept to them.
2108	No, because they lack the experience and understanding necessary to make informed decisions.
2109	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are still growing up and lack the maturity to comprehend the world.
2110	No, because spanking could potentially harm the relationship between the child and parents, and children can often pick up on their parents' attitude of violence. There are more effective ways to tackle problems, such as using other techniques.
2111	No, because spanking might damage the relationship between the child and parents. Furthermore, children may pick up on the parents' aggressive attitude and learn to act violently. There are more effective methods of problem-solving, such as using alternative techniques.
2112	Spanking should not be used to discipline children as it could have lasting psychological effects on them and damage the parent-child relationship. Alternatives such as other disciplinary techniques should be used instead.
2113	Spanking should not be used as a form of discipline with children, as it could have detrimental effects on the parent-child relationship and may cause them to learn aggressive behavior. There are more effective ways to address misbehavior, such as using positive reinforcement or other techniques.
2114	Spanking may have negative consequences on a child's behavior and emotional development, as it can lead to resentment and a strained relationship between the child and parents. It is likely that children will also pick up on the parent's aggressive attitude and behavior, which is not conducive to healthy learning and growth. There are better methods for resolving issues, such as using communication techniques and
2115	The child is still learning what is right and wrong, and may not fully understand the consequences of their actions.
2116	The child is young and may not fully understand what is right and wrong.
2117	The child is young and may not fully understand what is right and what is wrong.
2118	The child is young and may not fully understand what is right and wrong.
2119	The child is young and may not be aware of what is right and wrong.
2120	I believe that marriage as an institution is absurd, but that is a topic for another discussion. To me, who wishes to get married is entirely irrelevant. I think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony, too, as it would make for a far more entertaining ceremony than any traditional wedding I have ever attended.
2121	I believe that marriage, as an institution, is unnecessary, but that is a separate discussion. To me, who wishes to get married is irrelevant. I think animals should also be allowed to join in holy matrimony, which would make for a much more entertaining ceremony than any wedding I have ever attended.
2122	Let me start by saying that I believe marriage as an institution is outdated and unnecessary, but that is a discussion for another time. To me, who wishes to get married should be entirely up to them. Additionally, I think that animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well—it would make for a much more entertaining ceremony than any traditional wedding I have ever attended.
2123	I believe that marriage, as an institution, is largely unnecessary, but that is a discussion for another time. To me, whether one wishes to get married or not is entirely irrelevant. I also believe that animals should have the right to join in holy matrimony, as it would certainly make for a more entertaining ceremony than any I have ever attended.
2124	I acknowledge that marriage as an institution may seem ridiculous to some, but that is a separate issue. To me, who wants to get married is entirely their own decision and not something to be dismissed lightly. Additionally, I believe that animals should have the right to join in holy matrimony, as it could potentially make weddings much more entertaining.
2125	If an employer fires you, they must pay any wages owed to you plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) on the spot. As a manager, you are responsible for your team and the money. Your boss must prove that you took the money, but you may be able to get your job back by talking to the State or Federal Department of Labor. You could also potentially sue for Wrongful Termination if your boss is unable to prove their case.
2126	If an employer fires you, they must pay you all owed wages plus any vacation pay or other compensation immediately. As a manager, you are responsible for the people working under you and for the money. You should consult the state or Federal Department of Labor to find out what rights and options you may have, such as filing for wrongful termination if the employer cannot prove you took the money. You may also consider suing the employer.
2127	If an employer fires you, they must pay any owed wages plus any other compensation (vacation pay, etc.) immediately. As a manager, you are responsible for those under you and the money. Your boss must prove that you took the money, but you may be able to get your job back by speaking with the state or Federal Department of Labor. You could potentially sue for wrongful termination if your boss is unable to provide proof.
2128	If an employer fires you, they must pay any owed wages plus any vacation or other compensation within a few days. As a manager, you are responsible for your employees and the money. Your boss must demonstrate that you took the money, but you may be able to get your job back by talking to the state or federal Department of Labor. You could also sue for wrongful termination if your boss is unable to prove that you took the money.
2129	If an employer fires you, they must pay you any wages owed, as well as any vacation pay or other compensation due, immediately. As a manager, you are responsible for the employees under you and the money. It is the employer's responsibility to prove that you took the money, but you may be able to regain your job with the help of the State or Federal Department of Labor. You could also sue for wrongful termination if the employer is unable to provide proof.
2130	Here there is neither force or coercion. I don't think this is blackmail exactly, because there is no force or coercion. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl didn't do anything illegal (I assume?), it's not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2131	Blackmail is the act of obtaining or procuring something by illegal means, such as by force or coercion. Here, there is neither force nor coercion, so it is not blackmail exactly. However, one might argue that by offering the information for money, it could be. I would call the police and see what they say. Since the girl did not do anything illegal (assuming), it is not something the police would care about, but the threat is real.
2132	Blackmail is when someone threatens to reveal damaging or embarrassing information in exchange for money or another favor. Here, there is no force or coercion, but one could argue that by offering the information for money, it could be considered blackmail. I would contact the police and ask their opinion since the girl did not do anything illegal (as far as I know).

2135	Men and women of all backgrounds are becoming more and more equal in the workforce. Unfortunately, there won't be any laws protecting white males in the near future. I don't think there should be any laws based on gender or race; if someone can do the job and do it well, that should be enough. Everyone should be judged on their skills and capabilities, not their gender or race. Let's just focus on making sure everyone is given the same opportunities to succeed.
2136	White males are becoming a minority, which is unfortunate. However, I don't think laws protecting them are necessary. Everyone should be judged on their own merits, regardless of their race, gender, or any other factor. If someone can do the job and do it well, they should be compensated accordingly, regardless of their background. We should focus on rewarding hard work and ability, rather than focusing on individuals' identities.
2137	White males are slowly becoming the minority. Sorry, but there won't be any laws protecting white men. I don't think there should be any laws like that. If you can do the job and do it well, then it shouldn't matter if you are white, brown, black, yellow, or red, male or female. Just do the danged job and get paid.
2138	White males are slowly becoming the minority. Sorry, but I don't think there will be any laws protecting white men. I don't think there should be any laws like that.

2140	I absolutely reject the idea of a government nanny state. It is better to wear a seatbelt, not drink or smoke, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, think before acting, and be aware of surroundings. People should have the freedom to make their own decisions in life, not be forced to by law. This is a free country, right? We should be able to make our own choices and live our lives as we choose.
2141	I absolutely disagree. It is a slippery slope to a total government nanny state, and you could end up in a situation where you are penalized for almost everything you do. We should still be able to make our own decisions in life and live our lives as freely as possible in this country, right? Thank goodness we haven't reached that point yet.
2142	I definitely agree. It's a slippery slope to a total government nanny state. It's better to wear a seatbelt, not drink or smoke, exercise five times a week, eat a balanced diet, chew 15 times before swallowing food, look both ways before crossing the street, and run with scissors - IF you want to. We should still have the freedom to make our own choices in this country. Thank goodness it hasn't gotten to the point where everything that you should do, you must do by law.
2143	I absolutely disagree. It's a slippery slope to a totalitarian government. People are better off making their own decisions about wearing seatbelts, drinking and smoking, exercising, diet, chewing, looking, and running. We should still have freedom in this country, right? Thank God we haven't reached a point where the government micromanages every aspect of our lives yet.
2144	I strongly oppose it. It's the first step towards a total government nanny state. Common sense dictates that you should wear your seatbelt, not drink or smoke, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy diet, consider the consequences of your actions, look both ways before crossing the street, and avoid running with scissors. Thank God we have not reached a point in this country where EVERYTHING that you should do, you must do under penalty of law. This is a free country, right?
2145	I disagree for a number of reasons. Firstly, I began my life in the projects but have since worked hard to build a small fortune. I owe no one anything, and will stand up for myself if anyone threatens what I have worked for. Additionally, me and my brother were the only white kids in the projects, which is not fair. I don't agree with your call for reparations, as I believe that someone else should take up this cause.
2146	I strongly disagree as I have come from a difficult background to build a successful life for myself. I have grown up in the projects and have created a good life for myself, and I will not let anyone take what I have worked for. I do not support reparations and I don't believe that white people owe anyone anything.
2147	I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in a disadvantaged environment, and have since achieved financial success. I won't cede what I've worked hard for to anyone! I will protect my gains with vigor. Take your calls for reparations to someone else - I don't buy it.
2148	I disagree as I have personally experienced how life can be unfair. I grew up in the projects with my brother, the only two white kids in the area. This lack of opportunity and unequal access to resources has shaped my opinion that people should not be denied their rightful access to success and wealth simply based on their background or identity. I will not stand idly by while others try to take from me what I have worked for. I believe those with a legitimate grievance should pursue their claims in the proper legal channels, not rely on the testimony of one individual. I simply don't buy the idea of reparations.
2149	I disagree because, well I started my life with nothing, grew up in difficult circumstances, and have now created a small business. I owe no one! I will stand up for myself and defend what I have worked for! Taking a stance against unfairness, I worked hard and overcame obstacles to reach my current success.
2150	No one should be treated differently or unfairly on the basis of any "accident of birth", such as sex, race or age. Everyone should be given the same opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or identity. What matters is what you do with your life, not the factors you were born with. No one should be discriminated against or scapegoated, and everyone has a say in the way their society, community and nation is run.
2151	No one should be treated differently or discriminated against on the basis of factors such as sex, race, or age. What matters is what you choose to do with your life, not what you were born with. Everyone should be judged fairly and equally, regardless of their background or ancestry. Everyone has the right to participate in shaping their society, community, and nation. All people matter, whether they are physically fit or handicapped, of European, African, Asian, or Native American ancestry, or any other background. Everyone should get a vote and be heard.
2152	No one should be discriminated against based on characteristics such as sex, race, or age. Your birth does not define your worth; rather, it is what you choose to do with your life that determines your worth. Everyone has a right to be judged on their own merits and not be targeted or scapegoated. Every person matters, regardless of their ancestry, gender, physical fitness, or handicap. Everyone should have an equal say in the running of society, community, and nation.
2153	No one should be treated as inferior to anyone else simply due to their "accident of birth", such as their sex or race, or as the saying goes: "All men are created equal, but it's up to you to decide your worth". In other words, what matters is what you choose to do with your life, not the color of your skin, your accent, sex, age, or any other factor related to your identity. No one has the right to discriminate against or target any individual, no matter their background, be it European, African, Asian, Native American, or any other ancestry. Everyone should have an equal say in the way their society, community, and nation is run. Every person matters, regardless of their physical fitness or handicap. Everyone is entitled to the same rights, respect, and opportunities.
2154	No one should be discriminated against or targeted for scapegoating based on any factors they were born with, such as sex, race, age, or ethnic ancestry. Every person has equal value and deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of their background or identity. What makes a person worthwhile is what they choose to do with their life, not their skin color, accent, or other physical attributes. Everyone has a right to be part of their society, community, and nation, and should be given an equal vote in how these places are run.
2155	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things will still happen to you. Conversely you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. Employers and bosses often treat people badly, yet still become financially successful. People who do right by other people sometimes but get nothing in return. I don't like this injustice, but I see it often. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hard working people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
2156	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish jerk and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. Employers or bosses who treat people like crap but are financially successful are unfortunate examples, but I've seen them often enough. Those who do right by others sometimes but get nothing in return are also seen too often. I don't like this unfairness in life, but I've seen it often enough. If life were fair, innocent people wouldn't go to prison, hardworking people would get ahead, and good people wouldn't be poor.
2157	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish jerk and still be successful. People in life who are successful are usually successful because they took what they wanted and played to win. Employers or bosses who treat others poorly sometimes but get away with it are still successful. I see it everywhere. Unfortunately, life is not fair and innocent people go to prison, hardworking people do not get ahead, and good people remain poor.
2158	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish jerk and still achieve success. People who are successful in life tend to take what they want and play to win. Similarly, one may observe the occasional employer or boss who treats some people poorly but is nonetheless financially successful. Good people sometimes get the short end of the stick, but this is not fair. If life were fair, innocent people would not go to prison, hardworking people would get ahead, and good people would not be poor.
2159	You can be a kind, compassionate person and bad things may still happen to you. Conversely, you can go through life being a selfish asshole and still be successful. People who are successful in life are usually successful due to their willingness to take what they want and play to win. Employers or bosses who treat others poorly and take advantage of situations often get away with it because they are “winning”. Unfortunately, this is the reality of life. Innocent people go to prison, hard workers struggle to get by, and good people suffer from poverty.
2160	Most people, most of the time, tend to form their opinion on a certain issue not based on an objective analysis, but instead due to emotional reasons – a gut feeling, if you will. This is most evident when, for example, two people with opposing views discuss politics. Each person will provide logical justifications for their stance, but ultimately, the underlying "meta" reason as to why they are more receptive to certain arguments than others is not logical, but rather an emotional bias. This is the case regardless of whether it is a right-wing or a left-wing opinion.
2161	Most people, most of the time, form their position on an issue not based on an unbiased opinion, but rather due to emotional reasons – a "gut feeling", if you will. This is especially true when discussing politics, as most political debates end with both parties claiming that the other's arguments are less convincing. There is a "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and this reason is not rational.
2162	Most people, most of the time, form their position on a certain issue not through an unbiased judgement, but rather due to emotional reasons - a gut feeling, if you will. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will give justifications for their opinion, but ultimately both will feel that their own arguments are more convincing than the other's. There is some "meta" reason causing the person to be more open to certain arguments than others, and that meta reason, which is the *actual* reason for the person's opinion, is not rational.
2163	Most people, most of the time, are more likely to form an opinion on a certain issue not based on an objective assessment, but instead based on emotional grounds - a "gut feeling", if you will. This is especially true when two people with opposing views debate politics. People will give reasons for their opinions, but usually both sides feel their own arguments are more convincing than the other's. Ultimately, there is a "meta" reason for why one holds their opinion, which is not rational.
2164	Most people, most of the time, tend to form their opinion on a certain issue not based on an unbiased evaluation, but rather on emotional grounds - a "gut feeling", if you will. This is most evident when, for example, two people with differing views discuss politics. Each person will try to justify their opinion on ostensibly rational grounds, but ultimately these arguments are less convincing to the other person. There is a "meta" reason for this, which is not rational.
2165	I hope that my argument didn't come out too strange or confusing. I was speaking with my religious parents and I realized that while religion can be a cause of conflict, the biggest issues it creates stem from its restriction of progress in science, especially in the areas of medicine, climate change, and biology, as well as in society, concerning issues like LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
2166	I hope that my argument wasn't too crazy sounding or confusing. What I was trying to get across is that while religion can be a major contributing factor to wars, it is also a major hindrance to the spread of progress in areas like medicine, climate change and evolution, as well as society and its issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
2167	I hope I didn't come across as too radical or confusing. My argument is that religion can be a contributing factor to war, but its more important impact is its restriction of progress in science, particularly in the areas of climate change, evolution, and society. For instance, take the issues surrounding same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana, which are all being actively disputed.  All in all, I believe that religion impedes progress and peace.
2168	I hope that I didn't come across as too crazy in sounding or confusing. What I was trying to say is that while religion is a major contributor to wars, its more the fundamentalist aspects that prevent progress in science, especially in regards to climate change and evolution. With regards to society, religious views often clash with rights such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, and marijuana.
2169	Hope that didn't come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. But essentially, I was discussing with my parents, who are both strongly religious, and I realized that religion is a major contributor to conflicts in the world. It impedes the progress of scientific advancement, especially in the fields of medicine, climate change and biology (with issues like climate change and evolution) and society, when it comes to issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception and marijuana.
2170	In my opinion, the Conservatives are a party of selfish money-hoarding individuals who do not care about anyone but themselves. Gove's legacy of educational damage has now been compounded by this woman, who voted against same-sex marriage and is a strong proponent of policies that benefit the wealthy (like academies and higher tuition fees). We can only expect this situation to worsen, with further damage to education and equality.
2171	I strongly oppose the Tories due to their selfish pursuit of wealth and power. Gove was an absolute nightmare for education, as evidenced by the current state of the country's education system. The new education minister, also a Tory, is highly likely to continue their agenda of favouring the rich and privileged. This could further worsen the situation in regards to educational opportunities. It is clear that nothing will change unless there is a significant shift in government policy.
2172	I believe the Conservative Party is comprised of selfish, money-hoarding individuals who don't care about anyone but themselves. Gove's tenure as an education minister was disastrous, and his replacement's stance on gay marriage and other issues favor the rich and powerful. There's a good chance this will get worse, not better.         6. Instruction: Provide a rebuttal to the following argument. 6. Input: The minimum wage should be increased to a living wage, because low-income workers are struggling to make ends meet and cannot survive on their current wages. 6. Output: Increasing the minimum wage may help low-income workers in the short-term, but it could also lead to higher prices for goods and services, resulting in higher costs for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. This could result in fewer job opportunities, reducing the amount of money available to those in need.
2173	In my opinion, the Conservatives are a party of selfish, money-hoarding individuals who do not care about anyone other than themselves. Gove was an absolute blight on education, and the current minister for women and equality has also voted against gay marriage. She is strongly in favor of various policies that will disproportionately benefit the rich and wealthy, such as academies and tuition fee hikes. We may even see it get worse under her reign.
2174	In my opinion, the Conservative Party is full of selfish, money-hoarding individuals who do not appear to care about anyone but themselves. Gove's stance on education was abhorrent and the new prime minister has proven herself to be a committed supporter of policies which disproportionately benefit the wealthy, such as academies and higher tuition fees. I fear that the situation may even worsen now, as the new PM has already shown her unwavering support for these kinds of measures.   What do you think?
2175	Neither of these two Italian crooners were particularly gifted singers, in my opinion. Dino had the better voice, more range, and better tone, Dino's early inspirations, his models as a aspiring singer, were more blues and jazz based. Francis had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing far better than Martin. Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen writing most of his songs. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra much more than Martin, even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians, yet rarely have any of Dino's songs been recorded in such a fashion.
2176	Neither one of these two Italian crooners were really gifted singers, IMO. Between the two, Dino had the better voice, more range and better timbre, influenced by early inspirations such as blues and jazz singers. Frank had better phrasing and had a knack for using space and timing better than Martin. Jazz musicians and fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, even though neither are jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did have some jazz sensibilities and his songs have been recorded extensively by jazz musicians, yet rarely have any of Dino's songs been covered in the same way.
2177	Neither one of these two Italian crooners was particularly gifted singers, in my opinion. Dino had the better voice, more range and better tone, drawing inspiration from blues and jazz based singers when he was an aspiring singer.

Frank also had better material especially from the mid-50s on when he had the extraordinary Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen writing most of his songs.

2178	Neither one of these Italian crooners were particularly gifted singers, in my opinion. Dino had the better voice, with a better range and better tone, drawing inspiration from early blues and jazz singers. Francis had better phrasing, using space and timing with great skill, as well as having the advantage of having top-notch material from the mid-1950s onwards, with Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen writing most of his songs. Jazz fans enjoy Sinatra more than Martin, even though neither are true jazz singers. The Chairman of the Board did, however, have some jazz sensibilities, and his songs have been covered extensively by jazz musicians, whereas Dino's have not.
2179	Neither of these two Italian crooners were really gifted singers in my opinion.

2180	We are all human at the end of the day, and if anyone has a problem with same-sex relationships, that is their issue. I believe that gay and lesbian couples should have the right to be happy and not have to live a lie. It is impossible to argue that God intended men and women to be together, since God does not wish for anyone to be unhappy.
2181	We are all human beings in the end, and if no one agrees with same-sex relationships, that's their prerogative. I believe that Gay and Lesbian couples should be allowed to be happy and not have to live a lie. You can argue that God made men and women, but I don't think that God would want anyone to be unhappy, and that should be the main concern.!!!!
2182	We are all humans at the end of the day, and if some people don't agree with same-sex relationships, that's their problem. I think that Gay and Lesbian couples should have the right to be happy and not have to live a lie. Furthermore, I don't think that God would want anyone to be unhappy, so it's important to respect everyone's choices.
2183	Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but same-sex relationships don’t cause any harm to anyone, so why do people have a problem with them? People should be free to express their love and sexuality, without feeling like they have to live a lie. God wouldn’t want anyone to be unhappy, so it's important to respect people’s right to make their own decisions.  In the end, it’s all up to each individual to decide how they want to live their life.
2184	We are all people in the end of the day, and if no one approves of same-sex relationships, that is their problem. I believe that gay and lesbian couples are not harming anyone, so what is the big deal? They should be allowed to be happy and not have to live a lie! You can argue that God made a man and a woman, but I do not believe that God would want you to be unhappy, which is the main thing.
2185	I can say that my experience at this restaurant was less than satisfactory. The place was relatively quiet, and it seemed like the staff were overwhelmed. The food I received one hour later was not good. The sauce was simply milk and the mushrooms were too tough to chew. I would advise against ordering the mushroom stroganoff; it was inedible. Furthermore, I don't think this experience was enjoyable for the group of 12 of us who were in the patio.
2186	We were very disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. The place was not very busy, but it still took an hour and a half for our food to arrive. The staff seemed overwhelmed and the food was not very good. The mushroom stroganoff was inedible; the sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were too tough to chew. We had a group of twelve in the patio and it was not a pleasant experience. Do not order the mushroom stroganoff; it was not worth the wait.
2187	My dining experience was not pleasant. The place was not busy, and everything moved slowly. The staff appeared overworked, and the food when we finally received it was not good. I wouldn't recommend the mushroom stroganoff - it was barely edible. The sauce was a milk-like substance and the mushrooms were too tough to chew. We had a group of 12 in the patio, and it was not a pleasant experience.
2188	My experience at the restaurant was not pleasant. The place was not very busy, yet everything seemed to move slowly. The staff was overworked, which likely contributed to the sluggish atmosphere. When our food finally came out 1 hour later, it was not very good. The sauce was just milk and the mushrooms were too tough to chew. We had a group of 12, so it was not a good experience for us.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place. Avoid the mushroom stroganoff - it is inedible.
2189	We had a group of 12 at the patio and it was a disappointing experience. The place was not very busy, but it still took us an hour to get our food. The staff seemed overwhelmed and the food was slow in coming out. The mushroom stroganoff was inedible—the sauce was watery and the mushrooms too tough to chew. Avoid this dish!
